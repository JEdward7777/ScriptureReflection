record of the genealogy of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham.
Abraham fathered Isaac, Isaac fathered Jacob, and Jacob fathered Judah and his brothers.
Judah fathered Perez and Zerah by Tamar, and Perez fathered Hezron, and Hezron fathered Ram.
Ram fathered Amminadab, Amminadab fathered Nahshon, and Nahshon fathered Salmon.
Salmon fathered Boaz by Rahab, and Boaz fathered Obed by Ruth, and Obed fathered Jesse.
And Jesse fathered David, the king; and David, the king, fathered Solomon by the wife of Uriah.
Solomon fathered Rehoboam, Rehoboam fathered Abijah, and Abijah fathered Asa.
And Asa fathered Jehoshaphat; Jehoshaphat fathered Joram; and Joram fathered Uzziah.
Uzziah fathered Jotham; Jotham fathered Ahaz; and Ahaz fathered Hezekiah.
Hezekiah fathered Manasseh; Manasseh fathered Amon; and Amon fathered Josiah.
And Josiah fathered Jeconiah and his brothers at the time of the Babylonian exile.
After the Babylonian exile, Jeconiah became the father of Shealtiel, and Shealtiel became the father of Zerubbabel.
Zerubbabel fathered Abiud, Abiud fathered Eliakim, and Eliakim fathered Azor.
Azor fathered Sadok, Sadok fathered Achim, and Achim fathered Elihud.
Elihud fathered Eleazar, Eleazar fathered Matthan, and Matthan fathered Jacob.
And Jacob fathered Joseph, the husband of Mary, of whom was born Jesus, who is called Christ.
So all the generations from Abraham to David are fourteen generations, and from David until the exile to Babylon are fourteen generations, and from the exile to Babylon until Christ are fourteen generations.
Now the birth of Jesus Christ took place in this way: when His mother Mary had been pledged to Joseph, before they came together, she was found to be with child by the Holy Spirit.
But Joseph her husband, being a just man and not willing to make her a public example, was minded to put her away secretly.
But while he pondered these things, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream, saying, 'Joseph, son of David, do not be afraid to take Mary as your wife; for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Spirit.'
And she will give birth to a Son, and you shall name Him Jesus, for He will save His people from their sins.
All this took place to fulfill what was spoken by the Lord through the prophet, saying:
Behold, the virgin shall conceive in her womb and bear a son, and they shall call his name Emmanuel, which means 'God with us.'
And when Joseph awoke from his sleep, he did as the angel of the Lord had commanded him, and took his wife.
And he did not know her intimately until she had given birth to her firstborn son, and he named him Jesus.
Now after Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea in the days of King Herod, behold, wise men from the east came to Jerusalem.
saying, ‘Where is the one who has been born king of the Jews? For we have seen his star in the east and have come to worship him.’
When King Herod heard this, he was disturbed, and all Jerusalem with him.
And gathering together all the chief priests and scribes of the people, he asked them where the Christ was to be born.
They replied, "In Bethlehem of Judea, for this is what has been written through the prophet:"
And you, Bethlehem, in the land of Judah, are by no means the least among the rulers of Judah; for out of you will come a leader who will shepherd my people Israel.
Then Herod secretly called for the Magi and ascertained from them the exact time the star had appeared.
And he sent them to Bethlehem, saying, 'Go and search diligently for the child; and when you find him, report back to me, so that I too may come and worship him.'
When they heard the king, they went on their way; and behold, the star that they had seen in the east went before them until it came to rest over the place where the child was.
When they saw the star, they rejoiced with exceedingly great joy.
And entering the house, they saw the child with Mary his mother; and falling down, they worshipped him. And opening their treasures, they offered him gifts: gold, frankincense, and myrrh.
And having been warned in a dream not to return to Herod, they departed for their own country by another way.
Now after they had departed, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream, saying, 'Rise, take the child and his mother, and flee to Egypt, and remain there until I tell you; for Herod is about to search for the child, to destroy him.'
And he arose, took the child and his mother by night, and withdrew to Egypt.
And he remained there until the death of Herod, in order that what was spoken by the Lord through the prophet might be fulfilled, saying: 'Out of Egypt, I called My Son.'
Then Herod, seeing that he had been deceived by the wise men, was exceedingly angry; and sending forth, he killed all the male children in Bethlehem and in all its vicinity who were two years old and under, according to the time which he had determined from the wise men.
Then what was spoken through the prophet Jeremiah was fulfilled, saying:
A voice was heard in Ramah, weeping and loud lamentation; Rachel is weeping for her children, and she refuses to be comforted, because they are no more.
But when Herod had died, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream while he was in Egypt.
saying, 'Rise, take the child and his mother, and go to the land of Israel, for those who sought the child's life are dead.'
And he arose, took the child and his mother, and went to the land of Israel.
But upon hearing that Archelaus was reigning over Judea in place of his father Herod, he was afraid to go there; and having been warned in a dream, he withdrew to the regions of Galilee.
And he came and dwelt in a city called Nazareth, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophets, 'He shall be called a Nazarene.'
In those days, John the Baptist appeared, preaching in the wilderness of Judea.
And saying, 'Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is drawing near.'
For this is he who was spoken of by the prophet Isaiah, saying: 'The voice of one crying in the wilderness, prepare the way of the Lord; make His paths straight.'
Now John himself had clothing made of camel's hair, with a leather belt around his waist, and his food was locusts and wild honey.
Then people from Jerusalem and all of Judea, and all the region around the Jordan, went out to him.
And they were baptized by him in the Jordan River, confessing their sins.
But when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming to his baptism, he said to them, 'You brood of vipers! Who warned you to flee from the coming wrath?'
Therefore, produce fruit that reflects true repentance.
And do not presume to say among yourselves, ‘We have Abraham as our father.’ For I tell you, God is able to raise up children for Abraham from these stones.
The axe is already laid at the root of the trees; therefore, every tree that does not produce good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.
I indeed baptize you with water for repentance; but the one coming after me is mightier than I, whose sandals I am not worthy to carry; he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and with fire.
His winnowing fork is in his hand, and he will thoroughly clean out his threshing floor; he will gather his wheat into the barn, but the chaff he will burn with unquenchable fire.
Then Jesus came from Galilee to the Jordan, to John, to be baptized by him.
But John tried to prevent Him, saying, "I have need to be baptized by You, and are You coming to me?"
But Jesus answered him, saying, "Let it be so now, for it is fitting for us to fulfill all righteousness." Then John consented to Him.
As soon as Jesus was baptized, He came up out of the water. At that moment, the heavens were opened to Him, and He saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and coming to rest on Him.
And behold, a voice from the heavens declared, 'This is my beloved Son, in whom I take great delight.'
Then Jesus was led by the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted by the devil.
And after fasting for forty days and forty nights, He was hungry.
And the tempter approached Him and said, 'If you are indeed the Son of God, command these stones to become bread.'
But He answered and said, 'It is written, Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that comes forth from the mouth of God.'
Then the devil took Him to the holy city and set Him on the pinnacle of the temple.
And he said to Him, 'If you are the Son of God, throw yourself down; for it is written, ‘He will command His angels concerning you,’ and ‘They will lift you up in their hands, so that you will not strike your foot against a stone.’
Jesus said to him, 'It is also written: You shall not put the Lord your God to the test.'
Again, the devil took him to a very high mountain and showed him all the kingdoms of the world and their glory.
And he said to him, "All these things I will give you if you fall down and worship me."
Then Jesus said to him, "Be gone, Satan! For it is written, 'You shall worship the Lord your God and serve Him alone.'"
Then the devil departed from him, and behold, angels came and began to serve him.
Now when Jesus heard that John had been handed over, he withdrew to Galilee.
And leaving Nazareth, he went and settled in Capernaum, by the sea, in the region of Zebulun and Naphtali.
so that what was spoken by the prophet Isaiah might be fulfilled, saying:
The land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali, the road by the sea, across from the Jordan, Galilee of the Gentiles.
The people who sat in darkness have seen a great light; and to those who dwelt in the region and shadow of death, light has dawned upon them.
From that time on, Jesus began to preach and say, "Repent, for the kingdom of heaven has drawn near."
As Jesus walked along the shore of the Sea of Galilee, He saw two brothers, Simon, called Peter, and his brother Andrew, casting a net into the sea, for they were fishermen.
And He said to them, 'Come, follow Me, and I will make you fishers of men.'
And immediately they left their nets and followed Him.
And going on from there, He saw two other brothers, James the son of Zebedee and John his brother, in the boat with their father Zebedee, mending their nets, and He called them.
And immediately they left the boat and their father and followed Him.
And Jesus traveled throughout all of Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, proclaiming the good news of the kingdom, and healing every sickness and every disease among the people.
And news about Him spread throughout all of Syria, and they brought to Him all who were afflicted with various diseases and pains, those oppressed by demons, those suffering from seizures, and the paralyzed; and He healed them.
And great crowds followed Him from Galilee, the Decapolis, Jerusalem, Judea, and beyond the Jordan.
Seeing the crowds, He went up on the mountain, and when He sat down, His disciples came to Him.
And He opened His mouth and began to teach them, saying:
Blessed are the humble in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
Blessed are those who mourn, for they shall be comforted.
Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the earth.
Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they shall be filled.
Blessed are the merciful, for they shall obtain mercy.
Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God.
Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be recognized as children of God.
Blessed are those who are persecuted because of righteousness, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
Blessed are you when they revile you and persecute you, and say all kinds of evil against you falsely for My sake.
Rejoice and be exceedingly glad, for your reward is great in heaven; for so they persecuted the prophets who were before you.
You are the salt of the earth; but if the salt should lose its flavor, with what shall it be salted? It is no longer good for anything except to be thrown out and trampled underfoot by men.
You are the light of the world. A city set on a hill cannot be hidden.
Neither do they light a lamp and place it under a basket, but on a lampstand, and it gives light to all who are in the house.
In the same way, let your light shine before others, so that they may see your good works and give glory to your Father who is in heaven.
Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them.
Truly, I say to you, until heaven and earth pass away, not a single dot or stroke will disappear from the Law until all is accomplished.
Therefore, whoever relaxes one of the least of these commandments and teaches others to do the same will be called least in the kingdom of heaven; but whoever does them and teaches them will be called great in the kingdom of heaven.
For I say to you that unless your righteousness surpasses that of the scribes and Pharisees, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven.
You have heard that it was said to the ancients, 'You shall not commit murder,' and whoever commits murder will be subject to judgment.
But I say to you that everyone who is angry with his brother without cause shall be liable to judgment; and whoever says to his brother, 'You fool!' shall be liable to the council; and whoever says, 'You worthless one!' shall be liable to hellfire.
So if you are presenting your offering at the altar, and there remember that your brother has something against you,
Leave your gift there at the altar and first go and be reconciled to your brother; then come and offer your gift.
Agree with your adversary quickly, while you are on the way with him, lest your adversary deliver you to the judge, the judge hand you over to the officer, and you be thrown into prison.
Truly, I say to you, you will not leave there until you have paid the very last penny.
You have heard that it was said, 'You shall not commit adultery.'
But I say to you that everyone who looks at a woman with the intention to lust for her has already committed adultery with her in his heart.
But if your right eye causes you to stumble, tear it out and throw it away. For it is better for you to lose one part of your body than for your whole body to be thrown into hell.
And if your right hand causes you to stumble, cut it off and throw it away from you; for it is better for you to lose one of your members than for your whole body to be thrown into hell.
It has been said, ‘Whoever divorces his wife must give her a written notice of divorce.’
But I say to you that whoever divorces his wife, except for reasons of sexual immorality, causes her to commit adultery, and whoever marries a divorced woman commits adultery.
Again, you have heard that it was said to the ancients, 'You shall not break your oaths, but you shall fulfill to the Lord your vows.'
But I say to you, do not swear at all; neither by heaven, for it is the throne of God,
And do not swear by the earth, for it is the footstool of His feet; nor by Jerusalem, for it is the city of the great King.
And do not swear by your head, for you cannot make one hair white or black.
Let your word be simply yes or no; anything more than this comes from the evil one.
You have heard that it was said, 'An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth.'
But I say to you, do not resist the one who is evil; but if anyone slaps you on the right cheek, turn to him the other also.
And if anyone wants to sue you and take your tunic, let him have your cloak as well.
And whoever compels you to go one mile, go with him two.
Give to the one who asks of you, and do not turn away from the one who wants to borrow from you.
You have heard that it was said, 'You shall love your neighbor and hate your enemy.'
But I tell you, love your enemies, bless those who curse you, do good to those who hate you, and pray for those who persecute you.
so that you may be children of your Father in heaven. For He causes His sun to rise on both the evil and the good, and He sends rain on the righteous and the unrighteous.
For if you love those who love you, what reward do you have? Do not even tax collectors do the same?
And if you greet only your friends, what more are you doing than others? Do not even the tax collectors do the same?
Therefore, you are to be perfect, as your heavenly Father is perfect.
Beware of practicing your righteousness before others in order to be seen by them. For if you do, you will have no reward from your Father who is in heaven.
Therefore, when you give to the needy, do not sound a trumpet before you, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets, that they may be honored by men. Truly I say to you, they have received their reward.
But when you give to the needy, let not your left hand know what your right hand is doing,
So that your charitable giving may be in secret; and your Father who sees what is done in secret will reward you openly.
And when you pray, you shall not be like the hypocrites, for they love to stand and pray in the synagogues and at the corners of the streets, that they may be seen by men. Truly, I say to you, they have their reward.
But when you pray, go into your private room, and shutting the door, pray to your Father who is in the secret place; and your Father who sees what is done in secret will reward you openly.
And when you pray, do not use meaningless repetition like the Gentiles, for they think that they will be heard for their many words.
Therefore, do not be like them; for your Father knows what you need before you ask Him.
In this manner, therefore, you should pray: Our Father who is in heaven, may Your name be kept holy.
Let Your kingdom come; let Your will be done, on earth as it is in heaven.
Give us today the bread we need for this day.
And forgive us our debts, as we also forgive our debtors.
And do not lead us into temptation, but deliver us from the evil one. For yours is the kingdom and the power and the glory, forever. Amen.
For if you forgive others their wrongdoings, your heavenly Father will also forgive you.
But if you do not release others from their offenses, neither will your Father in heaven release your offenses.
When you fast, do not look somber as the hypocrites do, for they disfigure their faces to show others they are fasting. Truly I tell you, they have received their reward in full.
But when you fast, anoint your head and wash your face.
so that it will not be seen by others that you are fasting, but by your Father who is in secret; and your Father who sees in secret will reward you openly.
Do not store up treasures for yourselves on earth, where moths and rust destroy, and where thieves break in and steal.
But store up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust destroys, and where thieves do not break in and steal.
For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.
The eye is the lamp of the body; if your eye is healthy, your whole body will be full of light.
But if your eye is unhealthy, your whole body will be full of darkness. If then the light within you is darkness, how great is that darkness?
No one can serve two masters; for he will either hate one and love the other, or be devoted to one and disregard the other. You cannot serve God and wealth.
Therefore, I tell you, do not be anxious about your life, what you will eat or what you will drink, nor about your body, what you will wear. Is not life more than food, and the body more than clothing?
Look at the birds of the air: they neither sow nor reap nor gather into barns, yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not of more value than they?
And which of you by worrying can add a single cubit to his height?
And why do you worry about clothing? Observe the lilies of the field, how they grow; they do not labor or spin.
But I tell you that not even Solomon in all his glory was clothed like one of these.
But if God clothes the grass of the field, which is alive today and tomorrow is thrown into the fire, will He not much more clothe you, O you of little faith?
Therefore, do not be anxious, saying, 'What will we eat?' or 'What will we drink?' or 'What will we wear?'
For the Gentiles eagerly seek all these things; for your heavenly Father knows that you need all these.
But seek first the kingdom of God and His righteousness, and all these things will be given to you as well.
Therefore, do not be anxious about tomorrow, for tomorrow will take care of itself. Each day has enough trouble of its own.
Do not judge others, so that you will not be judged.
For with the measure you use, it will be measured to you; and the standard by which you judge, you will be judged.
Why do you see the speck in your brother's eye, but do not notice the beam that is in your own eye?
Or how can you say to your brother, ‘Let me take the speck out of your eye,’ when there is a beam in your own eye?
You hypocrite! First, take the log out of your own eye, and then you will see clearly to take the speck out of your brother's eye.
Do not give what is holy to dogs, nor cast your pearls before swine, lest they trample them under their feet and turn and tear you to pieces.
Ask, and it will be given to you; seek, and you will find; knock, and it will be opened to you.
For everyone who asks receives, and he who seeks finds, and to him who knocks, it will be opened.
Or what man among you, if his son asks for bread, will give him a stone?
And if he asks for a fish, will he give him a serpent?
If you, being evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father who is in heaven give good things to those who ask Him?
Therefore, whatever you wish that others would do to you, do also to them; for this is the essence of the Law and the Prophets.
Enter through the narrow gate; for the gate is wide and the path is spacious that leads to destruction, and many are those who enter through it.
How narrow is the gate, and how troubled is the path that leads to life! And there are few who find it.
Beware of false prophets, who come to you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly they are ravenous wolves.
You will know them by their fruits. Do people gather grapes from thornbushes or figs from thistles?
In the same way, every good tree produces good fruit, but a rotten tree produces bad fruit.
A good tree cannot bear bad fruit, nor can a bad tree bear good fruit.
Every tree that does not produce good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.
Therefore, by their fruits you will recognize them.
Not everyone who says to me, 'Lord, Lord,' will enter the kingdom of heaven, but only the one who does the will of my Father who is in heaven.
Many will say to me on that day, 'Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name, and in your name cast out demons, and in your name perform many mighty works?'
And then I will declare to them, 'I never knew you; depart from me, you workers of lawlessness.'
Therefore, everyone who hears these words of mine and puts them into practice is like a wise man who built his house on the rock.
And the rain fell, and the rivers came, and the winds blew and beat against that house, yet it did not fall, for it was founded upon the rock.
And everyone who hears these words of mine and does not act on them will be like a foolish man who built his house on the sand.
And the rain fell, and the rivers came, and the winds blew and struck that house; and it fell, and great was its fall.
And it came to pass that when Jesus had finished these words, the crowds were amazed at his teaching.
For He taught them with authority, and not as the scribes.
When He came down from the mountain, great crowds followed Him.
And behold, a leper came to Him, and knelt before Him, saying, 'Lord, if You are willing, You can make me clean.'
And stretching out His hand, Jesus touched him, saying, 'I am willing; be cleansed.' And immediately his leprosy was cleansed.
And Jesus said to him, "See that you tell no one; but go, show yourself to the priest and offer the gift that Moses commanded, as a testimony to them."
When He entered Capernaum, a centurion approached Him, pleading with Him and saying,
"Lord, my servant is lying at home paralyzed, suffering greatly."
And Jesus said to him, 'I will come and heal him.'
But the centurion answered and said, 'Lord, I am not worthy that You should come under my roof; only speak a word, and my servant will be healed.'
For I am a man under authority, having soldiers under me. I say to this one, 'Go,' and he goes; and to another, 'Come,' and he comes; and to my servant, 'Do this,' and he does it.
When Jesus heard this, He marveled and said to those who followed Him, "Truly, I say to you, I have not found such great faith, even in Israel."
But I say to you that many will come from the east and the west and will sit down with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven.
But the sons of the kingdom will be cast out into outer darkness; there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.
And Jesus said to the centurion, "Go; as you have believed, let it be done for you." And his servant was healed at that very hour.
And when Jesus entered Peter's house, he saw his mother-in-law lying sick with a fever.
And He touched her hand, and the fever left her; and she arose and began to serve Him.
When evening came, they brought to Him many who were possessed by demons, and He cast out the spirits with a word and healed all who were sick.
Thus fulfilling what was spoken through the prophet Isaiah: "He took our weaknesses upon Himself and carried our diseases."
When Jesus saw the large crowds around Him, He commanded them to depart to the other side.
And a scribe came to Him and said, "Teacher, I will follow You wherever You go."
And Jesus said to him, "The foxes have their dens, and the birds of the air have their nests, but the Son of Man has nowhere to rest His head."
Another of His disciples said to Him, "Lord, permit me first to go and bury my father."
But Jesus said to him, "Follow Me, and let the spiritually dead bury their own dead."
And when He entered the boat, His disciples followed Him.
And behold, a great storm arose on the sea, so that the boat was being swamped by the waves; but He was asleep.
And approaching Him, His disciples awoke Him, saying, "Lord, save us; we are perishing!"
But He said to them, "Why are you afraid, you of little faith?" Then He rose and rebuked the winds and the sea, and there was a great calm.
And the men marveled, saying, "What kind of man is this, that even the winds and the sea obey him?"
And when He had come to the other side, to the region of the Gadarenes, two demon-possessed men met Him, coming out of the tombs; they were exceedingly fierce, so that no one could pass that way.
And behold, they cried out, saying, 'What do You have to do with us, Jesus, Son of God? Have You come here to torment us before the appointed time?'
Now there was a large herd of many swine feeding at a distance from them.
The demons, however, implored Him, saying, 'If You cast us out, permit us to go away into the herd of pigs.'
And He said to them, "Go." So they went out and entered the herd of pigs; and behold, the entire herd of pigs rushed down the steep bank into the sea and perished in the waters.
But the herdsmen fled, and going into the city, they reported everything that had happened, including what had occurred with the demon-possessed men.
And behold, all the people of the city came out to meet Jesus; and when they saw Him, they begged Him to depart from their region.
And He got into a boat, crossed over, and arrived at His own city.
And behold, they brought to Him a paralytic lying on a bed; and when Jesus saw their faith, He said to the paralytic, 'Take heart, son; your sins are forgiven.'
And behold, some of the scribes said among themselves, 'This man is speaking blasphemy.'
And Jesus, perceiving their thoughts, said, "Why do you harbor evil intentions in your hearts?"
For which is easier to say, 'Your sins are forgiven,' or to say, 'Rise up and walk?'
But so that you may understand that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins, he then said to the paralytic, 'Get up, take your bed, and go home.'
And rising up, he went away to his house.
But when the crowds saw it, they were filled with awe and glorified God, who had given such authority to men.
As Jesus passed on from there, He saw a man sitting at the tax booth, named Matthew, and He said to him, 'Follow Me.' And he arose and followed Him.
And it happened that as Jesus was reclining in the house, behold, many tax collectors and sinners came and reclined with Him and His disciples.
When the Pharisees saw this, they said to His disciples, 'Why does your Teacher eat with tax collectors and sinners?'
But when Jesus heard this, He said to them, 'It is not the healthy who need a physician, but the sick.'
But go and learn what this means: 'I desire mercy, not sacrifice.' For I have come not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.
Then the disciples of John came to Him, asking, 'Why do we and the Pharisees fast often, but Your disciples do not fast?'
And Jesus said to them, 'Can the sons of the bridechamber mourn while the bridegroom is with them? As long as they have the bridegroom with them, they cannot mourn. But the days will come when the bridegroom will be taken away from them, and then they will fast.'
No one sews a patch of unshrunken cloth onto an old garment; for the patch will pull away from the garment, and a worse tear will result.
Neither do they put new wine into old wineskins; otherwise the skins burst, and the wine spills out, and the wineskins are ruined. But they put new wine into new wineskins, and both are preserved.
While he was speaking these things to them, behold, a ruler came and knelt before him, saying, 'My daughter has just died; but come and lay your hand on her, and she will live.'
And Jesus arose and followed him, along with his disciples.
And behold, a woman who had been suffering from a flow of blood for twelve years came up behind Him and touched the fringe of His garment.
For she said to herself, 'If I can just touch His garment, I will be healed.'
But Jesus turned, and when He saw her, He said, "Take courage, daughter; your faith has healed you." And from that hour, the woman was made whole.
And when Jesus arrived at the ruler's house and saw the flute players and the noisy crowd, He said to them,
'Go away, for the girl is not dead; she is just sleeping.' And they laughed at Him.
But when the crowd had been put outside, He went in, took her by the hand, and the girl arose.
And this report spread throughout all that land.
And as Jesus went on from there, two blind men followed Him, crying out, "Have mercy on us, Son of David!"
When He entered the house, the blind men approached Him, and Jesus said to them, "Do you believe that I am able to do this?" They said to Him, "Yes, Lord."
Then He touched their eyes, saying, "Let it be done to you according to your faith."
And their eyes were opened. Jesus sternly warned them, saying, "See that no one knows it."
But when they went out, they widely proclaimed Him throughout all that region.
As they were leaving, behold, they brought to Him a man who was mute and possessed by a demon.
And when the demon was cast out, the mute spoke; and the crowds were astonished, saying, 'Never has anything like this been seen in Israel!'
But the Pharisees said, 'He casts out demons by the ruler of demons.'
And Jesus went about all the cities and villages, teaching in their synagogues, proclaiming the good news of the kingdom, and healing every disease and every ailment among the people.
But when He saw the crowds, He was moved with compassion for them, because they were distressed and dejected, like sheep without a shepherd.
Then He said to His disciples, 'The harvest is indeed abundant, but the laborers are few.'
Therefore, plead with the Lord of the harvest to send out laborers into His harvest.
And having called His twelve disciples to Him, He gave them authority over unclean spirits, to cast them out, and to heal every disease and every affliction.
Now, these are the names of the twelve apostles: first, Simon, who is called Peter, and his brother Andrew; James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother.
Philip and Bartholomew; Thomas and Matthew the tax collector; James the son of Alphaeus, and Thaddeus, who is also called Lebbaeus.
Simon the Zealot, and Judas Iscariot, who also betrayed Him.
These twelve Jesus sent out, commanding them, saying, 'Do not go on the road of the Gentiles, and do not enter a city of the Samaritans;'
But rather go to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.
As you go, preach, saying, 'The kingdom of heaven has come near.'
Heal the sick, cleanse those afflicted with leprosy, raise the dead, cast out demons; you received without payment; give without pay.
Do not acquire gold or silver or bronze for your belts.
Do not take any extra money, nor two tunics, nor sandals, nor a staff; for the worker is worthy of his food.
And into whatever city or village you enter, inquire who in it is worthy, and there remain until you go out.
As you enter the house, greet it, saying, ‘Peace be upon this house!’
And if the house is deserving, let your peace rest upon it; but if it is not deserving, let your peace return to you.
And whoever does not receive you or listen to your words, as you leave that house or city, shake the dust off your feet.
Truly, I tell you, it will be more tolerable for the land of Sodom and Gomorrah on the day of judgment than for that city.
Behold, I am sending you out as sheep in the midst of wolves; therefore be as wise as serpents and innocent as doves.
Beware of people, for they will hand you over to councils, and in their synagogues, they will whip you.
And you will be brought before governors and kings because of me, to testify to them and to the nations.
But when they deliver you over, do not be anxious about how or what you are to say; for it will be given to you in that hour what you are to say.
For it is not you who will be speaking, but the Spirit of your Father speaking through you.
Brother will betray brother to the point of death, and a father will hand over his child; children will rise up against their parents and put them to death.
And you will be hated by all for my name’s sake; but the one who endures to the end will be saved.
When they persecute you in this city, flee to another; for truly, I say to you, you will not finish going through the cities of Israel before the Son of Man comes.
A disciple is not above his teacher, nor is a servant above his master.
It is enough for the disciple to become like his teacher, and the servant like his master. If they have called the master of the house Beelzebul, how much more will they malign those of his household?
So have no fear of them, for nothing is covered that will not be revealed, and nothing is hidden that will not be made known.
What I tell you in the dark, speak in the light; and what you hear whispered, proclaim from the rooftops.
And do not be afraid of those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul. Rather, fear him who is able to destroy both soul and body in hell.
Are not two sparrows sold for a penny? Yet not one of them will fall to the ground apart from your Father.
And even the very hairs on your head are all counted.
So do not be afraid; you are worth more than many sparrows.
Therefore, everyone who confesses me before men, I will also confess him before my Father who is in heaven.
But whoever denies me before others, I will also deny him before my Father who is in heaven.
Do not think that I came to bring peace to the earth; I did not come to bring peace, but a sword.
For I have come to set a man against his father, a daughter against her mother, and a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law.
And a man's foes will be those of his own household.
Whoever loves father or mother more than me is not worthy of me, and whoever loves son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me.
And whoever does not take up his cross and follow me is not worthy of me.
Whoever finds his life will lose it, and whoever loses his life for my sake will find it.
The one who welcomes you welcomes me, and the one who welcomes me welcomes the one who sent me.
Whoever welcomes a prophet because he is a prophet will receive a prophet's reward, and whoever welcomes a righteous person because he is righteous will receive a righteous person's reward.
And whoever gives even a cup of cold water to one of these little ones because he is my disciple, truly I say to you, he will not lose his reward.
Now it came to pass, when Jesus had finished instructing His twelve disciples, that He departed from there to teach and to proclaim in their cities.
Now when John the Baptist heard in prison about the works of the Christ, he sent two of his disciples.
He asked His disciples, 'Are You the One who is to come, or should we expect someone else?'
And Jesus answered them, 'Go and report to John what you hear and see:'
The blind receive their sight, the lame walk, lepers are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead are raised, and the poor have the good news proclaimed to them.
And blessed is the one who does not take offense at me.
As these men were leaving, Jesus began to speak to the crowds about John: "What did you go out into the wilderness to see? A reed swaying in the wind?
But what did you go out to see? A man clothed in fine garments? Look, those who wear fine clothes are found in royal palaces.
But what did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes, I tell you, and even more than a prophet.
For this is the one about whom it is written: 'Behold, I send my messenger before your face, who will prepare your way before you.'
Truly, I say to you, among those born of women there has not arisen anyone greater than John the Baptist; yet the least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he.
From the days of John the Baptist until now, the kingdom of heaven has been forcefully advancing, and the passionate take hold of it.
For all the prophets and the Law prophesied until John.
And if you are willing to accept it, he is the Elijah who was to come.
Whoever is able to hear, let them listen attentively.
But to what shall I compare this generation? It is like children sitting in the marketplaces and calling out to their companions,
We played a joyful tune for you, but you did not dance; we sang a lament, but you did not mourn.
For John came neither eating nor drinking, and they say, 'He has a demon.'
The Son of Man came eating and drinking, and they say, 'Look, a glutton and a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and sinners.' Yet wisdom is vindicated by her children.
Then He began to rebuke the cities where most of His mighty works had been done, because they did not repent.
Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! For if the mighty works that were done in you had been performed in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago, sitting in sackcloth and ashes.
But I say to you, it will be more bearable for Tyre and Sidon on the day of judgment than for you.
And you, Capernaum, will you be lifted up to the heavens? You will be brought down to the realm of the dead; for if the miraculous works that were performed in you had been done in Sodom, it would have remained until this day.
But I tell you that it will be more bearable for the land of Sodom on the day of judgment than for you.
At that time, Jesus declared, ‘I thank you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that you have hidden these things from the wise and intelligent, and have revealed them to little children;’
Yes, Father, for it was your good pleasure to do it this way.
All things have been entrusted to me by my Father. No one knows the Son except the Father, and no one knows the Father except the Son and those to whom the Son chooses to reveal him.
Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest.
Take my yoke upon you, and learn from me, for I am gentle and humble in heart, and you will find rest for your souls.
For my yoke is kind, and my burden is light.
At that time, Jesus went through the grain fields on the Sabbath, and His disciples were hungry, and began to pluck heads of grain and eat them.
But when the Pharisees saw it, they said to Him, "Look, Your disciples are doing what is not lawful to do on the Sabbath."
But He said to them, 'Have you not read what David did when he was hungry, he and those who were with him?'
How he entered the house of God and ate the showbread, which was not lawful for him to eat nor for those who were with him, except for the priests alone.
Or have you not read in the Law that on the Sabbath the priests in the temple profane the Sabbath and are blameless?
But I tell you that something greater than the temple is here.
If you had understood what this means, 'I desire mercy, not sacrifice,' you would not have condemned the innocent.
For the Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath.
And moving on from there, He entered their synagogue.
And behold, there was a man there with a withered hand. And they asked Him, saying, 'Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath?'—that they might accuse Him.
But He said to them, 'Which of you, having a single sheep, if it falls into a pit on the Sabbath, will not lay hold of it and lift it out?'
How much more valuable is a man than a sheep? Therefore, it is lawful to do good on the Sabbath.
Then He said to the man, "Stretch out your hand." And he stretched it out, and it was restored to health, as healthy as the other.
But the Pharisees went out and conspired against Him, how they might destroy Him.
But Jesus, aware of this, withdrew from there. Many crowds followed Him, and He healed them all.
And He sternly instructed them not to make Him known.
This was to fulfill what was spoken through the prophet Isaiah, saying:
Behold, My Servant whom I have chosen, My Beloved in whom My soul delights. I will put My Spirit upon Him, and He will proclaim justice to the nations.
He will not quarrel or cry out, nor will anyone hear His voice in the streets.
A bruised reed He will not break, and a smoldering wick He will not extinguish, until He leads justice to victory.
And in His name, the nations will place their hope.
Then a demon-possessed man who was blind and mute was brought to Him, and He healed him, so that the blind and mute man spoke and saw.
And all the crowds were astonished and said, "Could this be the Christ, the Son of David?"
But when the Pharisees heard this, they said, "This man does not cast out demons except by Beelzebul, the ruler of the demons."
But knowing their thoughts, Jesus said to them, "Every kingdom divided against itself will be brought to desolation, and every city or house divided against itself will not stand."
And if Satan drives out Satan, he is divided against himself; how then will his kingdom stand?
And if I cast out demons by Beelzebul, by whom do your sons cast them out? Therefore, they will be your judges.
But if I drive out demons by the Spirit of God, then the Kingdom of God has truly arrived among you.
Or how can someone enter the strong man’s house and carry off his possessions unless he first binds the strong man? Then he can plunder his house.
Anyone who is not with me stands against me, and anyone who does not gather with me scatters.
Therefore I say to you, every sin and blasphemy will be forgiven people, but the blasphemy against the Spirit will not be forgiven.
And whoever speaks a word against the Son of Man will be forgiven; but whoever speaks against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven, either in this age or in the age to come.
Either make the tree good, and its fruit good, or make the tree bad, and its fruit bad; for a tree is known by its fruit.
Brood of vipers, how can you, being evil, speak good things? For out of the abundance of the heart, the mouth speaks.
A good person brings forth good things from the good treasure of his heart, while an evil person brings forth evil things from the evil treasure.
But I say to you that every idle word that people speak, they will give an account for it on the day of judgment.
For by your words you will be justified, and by your words you will be condemned.
Then some of the scribes and Pharisees answered Him, saying, 'Teacher, we wish to see a sign from You.'
But He answered and said to them, 'A wicked and adulterous generation seeks after a sign, and no sign will be given to it except the sign of Jonah the prophet.'
For just as Jonah was in the belly of the great fish for three days and three nights, so will the Son of Man be in the heart of the earth for three days and three nights.
The men of Nineveh will rise in judgment against this generation and will condemn it, for they repented at the preaching of Jonah; and behold, something greater than Jonah is here.
The queen of the South will rise up at the judgment with this generation and condemn it, for she traveled from the farthest parts of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and behold, something greater than Solomon is here.
When the unclean spirit has gone out of a person, it wanders through waterless places, seeking rest, but it finds none.
Then it says, ‘I will return to my house from which I came.’ And when it arrives, it finds the place empty, swept, and beautifully adorned.
Then it goes and takes with it seven other spirits more wicked than itself, and they enter in and dwell there; and the last state of that man becomes worse than the first. So it will be with this wicked generation.
While He was still speaking to the crowds, behold, His mother and His brothers stood outside, seeking to speak with Him.
And someone said to Him, "Look, Your mother and Your brothers are standing outside, seeking to speak with You."
But He answered the one who told Him, 'Who is My mother, and who are My brothers?'
And stretching out His hand toward His disciples, He said, 'Here are My mother and My brothers.'
For whoever does the will of my Father who is in heaven, he is my brother, and sister, and mother.
On that same day, Jesus went out of the house and sat by the sea.
And great crowds gathered around Him, so that He got into a boat and sat down, while all the people stood on the shore.
And He spoke to them many things in parables, saying: "Behold, a sower went out to sow."
And as he sowed, some seeds fell along the roadside, and the birds came and devoured them.
Other seeds fell on rocky ground, where there was not much soil, and they sprang up quickly because they had no depth of earth.
But when the sun rose, they were scorched; and because they had no root, they withered away.
Others fell upon the thorns, and the thorns grew up and choked them.
But others fell on the good soil and yielded fruit: some a hundredfold, some sixty, and some thirty.
Whoever possesses ears to hear, let him listen attentively.
And the disciples approached Him, asking, 'Why do You speak to them in parables?'
He answered them, 'To you it has been granted to understand the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, but to them it has not been granted.'
For to the one who has, more will be given, and he will have an abundance; but from the one who does not have, even what he thinks he has will be taken away.
Therefore, I speak to them in parables, because seeing they do not see, and hearing they do not hear, nor do they understand.
In this way, the prophecy of Isaiah is fulfilled, which says: ‘You will listen and listen, yet will not comprehend; you will look and look, yet will not see.’
For the heart of this people has grown callous, and their ears are hard of hearing, and they have closed their eyes; otherwise, they might see with their eyes and hear with their ears and understand with their heart and turn, and I would heal them.
But blessed are your eyes, for they see, and your ears, for they hear.
Truly, I say to you, many prophets and righteous people longed to see what you see, and did not see it, and to hear what you hear, and did not hear it.
Therefore, hear the meaning of the parable of the sower.
When anyone hears the message of the kingdom and does not grasp it, the evil one comes and snatches away what was sown in his heart. This is the seed sown along the path.
But the one sown on rocky ground is the one who hears the word and immediately receives it with joy.
But he has no root in himself; he is temporary. And when tribulation or persecution arises because of the word, he is immediately offended.
But the one sown among thorns, this is he who hears the word; and the cares of this age and the deceitfulness of riches choke the word, and he becomes unfruitful.
But he who was sown on good soil, this is he who hears the word and understands it; who indeed bears fruit and produces, one a hundredfold, another sixty, and another thirty.
Another parable He put before them, saying: ‘The Kingdom of Heaven is like a man who sowed good seed in his field.’
But while everyone was sleeping, his enemy came and sowed weeds among the wheat, and went away.
When the wheat sprouted and produced grain, then the weeds also appeared.
Then the servants of the master came and said to him, ‘Sir, did you not sow good seed in your field? Where then did these weeds come from?’
But he said to them, ‘An enemy has done this.’ The servants then said to him, ‘Do you want us to go and gather them up?'
But he said, ‘No, lest in gathering the weeds you uproot the wheat along with them.'
Let both grow together until the harvest, and at the time of the harvest, I will say to the reapers: ‘First gather the weeds and bind them in bundles to be burned, but gather the wheat into my barn.'
He presented to them another parable, saying: ‘The kingdom of heaven is like a mustard seed, which a man took and sowed in his field;'
which is the smallest of all seeds; but when it has grown, it is larger than all the garden plants and becomes a tree, so that the birds of the air come and make nests in its branches.
He spoke another parable to them: "The Kingdom of Heaven is like yeast that a woman took and hid in three measures of flour, until it was all leavened."
All these things Jesus spoke to the crowds in parables; and without a parable He did not speak to them.
so that what was spoken through the prophet might be fulfilled, saying: 'I will open my mouth in parables; I will proclaim things hidden since the foundation of the world.'
Then, leaving the crowds, He went into the house. And His disciples approached Him, saying, "Please explain to us the parable of the tares of the field."
He answered and said to them, 'The one who sows the good seed is the Son of Man.'
The field is the world; the good seed are the children of the kingdom, but the tares are the children of the wicked one.
The enemy who sowed them is the devil; the harvest is the end of the age, and the reapers are angels.
Just as the weeds are gathered and burned with fire, so it will be at the end of this age.
The Son of Man will send out His angels, and they will gather out of His kingdom all causes of sin and all lawbreakers.
And they will throw them into the fiery furnace; there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.
Then the righteous will shine like the sun in the kingdom of their Father. He who has ears, let him hear.
Again, the Kingdom of Heaven is like a treasure hidden in a field, which a man found and hid; and for joy over it, he goes and sells all that he has and buys that field.
Again, the Kingdom of Heaven is like a merchant seeking beautiful pearls.
Who, upon finding one priceless pearl, went away and sold all that he had to purchase it.
Again, the Kingdom of Heaven is like a net that was thrown into the sea and gathered fish of every kind.
When it was full, the fishermen brought it ashore; sitting down, they collected the good fish into containers, but threw away the bad.
So it will be at the end of the age: the angels will come forth and separate the wicked from among the righteous.
And they will throw them into the fiery furnace; there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.
Jesus said to them, "Have you understood all these things?" They answered Him, "Yes, Lord."
And He said to them, "Therefore, every scribe instructed concerning the kingdom of heaven is like a householder who brings out of his treasure things new and old."
And it came to pass, when Jesus had finished these parables, that He departed from there.
And coming to His own hometown, He taught them in their synagogue, so that they were astonished and said, Where did this man get this wisdom and these miraculous powers?
Isn't this the son of the carpenter? Isn't His mother called Mary, and aren't His brothers James, Joseph, Simon, and Judas?
And are not all His sisters here with us? Where then did this man get all these things?
And they took offense at Him. But Jesus said to them, 'A prophet is not without honor except in his own country and in his own house.'
And He did not perform many miracles there because of their unbelief.
At that time, Herod the tetrarch heard reports about Jesus.
And he said to his servants, "This is John the Baptist; he has risen from the dead, and that is why miraculous powers are at work in him."
For Herod had arrested John and bound him in prison because of Herodias, his brother Philip's wife.
For John had been telling him, 'It is not lawful for you to have her.'
And although he wanted to put him to death, he feared the crowd, because they regarded him as a prophet.
But when Herod's birthday was celebrated, the daughter of Herodias danced before them and pleased Herod.
So he solemnly swore to her, 'Whatever you ask of me, I will give it to you, up to half my kingdom.'
But she, having been urged on by her mother, said, 'Give me here on a platter the head of John the Baptist.'
And the king was distressed; but because of his oaths and those who reclined at the table with him, he commanded that it be given to her.
So he sent and had John beheaded in the prison.
And his head was brought on a platter and given to the girl, who presented it to her mother.
And his disciples came and took the body and buried it, and they went and told Jesus.
When Jesus heard about it, He withdrew from there by boat to a desolate place by Himself. But when the crowds heard of it, they followed Him on foot from the cities.
And when Jesus went out, He saw a great multitude, and He was filled with pity for them and healed their sick.
As evening approached, His disciples came to Him, saying, 'This place is desolate, and the hour is already late; send the crowds away, that they may go into the villages and buy food for themselves.'
But Jesus said to them, 'They do not need to go away; you give them something to eat.'
They replied to Him, 'We have here only five loaves and two fish.'
He said, 'Bring them here to me.'
And he commanded the crowds to sit down on the grass. Taking the five loaves and the two fish, he looked up to heaven and blessed them; and breaking the loaves, he gave them to the disciples, and the disciples gave them to the crowds.
And they all ate and were filled, and they took up the leftovers of the broken pieces, twelve full baskets.
And those who ate were about five thousand men, besides women and children.
And immediately, Jesus compelled His disciples to get into the boat and go ahead of Him to the other side, while He dismissed the crowds.
After He had sent the crowds away, He went up on the mountain by Himself to pray. When evening came, He was there alone.
But the boat was already in the midst of the sea, troubled by the waves; for the wind was contrary.
Now in the fourth watch of the night, Jesus went to them, walking on the sea.
And when the disciples saw Him walking on the sea, they were troubled, saying, 'It is a ghost!' And from fear, they cried out.
But immediately Jesus spoke to them, saying, 'Take courage! It is I; do not be afraid.'
And Peter answered him, "Lord, if it is you, command me to come to you on the waters."
He said, "Come." And stepping down from the boat, Peter walked on the water to go to Jesus.
But when he saw the strong wind, he was afraid; and beginning to sink, he cried out, 'Lord, save me!'
Immediately, Jesus stretched out His hand and caught him, saying, 'O you of little faith! Why did you doubt?'
And when they entered the boat, the wind ceased.
Then those who were in the boat came and worshiped Him, saying, 'Truly, You are the Son of God.'
After they had crossed over, they arrived at the land of Gennesaret.
And when the men of that place recognized Him, they sent word throughout the whole region, and they brought to Him all who were afflicted.
And they implored Him that they might only touch the fringe of His garment. And as many as touched it were made perfectly whole.
Then the scribes and Pharisees who were from Jerusalem came to Jesus, saying:
Why do Your disciples break the tradition of the elders? For they do not wash their hands when they eat bread.
But He answered them, "And why do you also transgress the commandment of God because of your tradition?
For God commanded, saying, 'Honor your father and your mother'; and, 'He who speaks evil of father or mother, let him be put to death.'
But you say, 'Whoever says to his father or mother, "Whatever help you might have received from me is a gift," does not honor his father or mother.'
Thus, you have nullified the command of God for the sake of your tradition.
Hypocrites! Isaiah prophesied well about you, saying:
This people draws near to me with their mouths and honors me with their lips, but their hearts are far removed from me.
But in vain do they worship Me, teaching as doctrines the commandments of men.
And having summoned the crowd, He said to them, "Listen and understand."
It is not what enters the mouth that defiles a person, but what comes out of the mouth; this is what defiles a person.
Then His disciples approached Him and said, 'Do You realize that the Pharisees were offended when they heard this saying?'
But He answered and said, 'Every plant that My heavenly Father has not planted will be uprooted.'
Leave them alone; they are blind leaders of the blind. And if a blind man leads a blind man, both will fall into a pit.
Peter replied, "Please explain this parable to us."
But Jesus said, "Are you still so simple-minded?"
Do you not yet understand that whatever enters the mouth goes into the stomach and is eliminated?
But what comes out of the mouth proceeds from the heart, and this is what defiles a person.
For out of the heart come evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, sexual immoralities, thefts, false testimonies, and blasphemies.
These are the things that defile a person; but to eat with unwashed hands does not defile him.
And Jesus departed from there and withdrew to the regions of Tyre and Sidon.
And behold, a Canaanite woman from those regions came out and cried out to him, saying, "Have mercy on me, Lord, Son of David; my daughter is severely tormented by a demon."
But He did not answer her a word. And His disciples came and urged Him, saying, "Send her away, for she cries out after us."
But He answered and said, "I was sent only to the lost sheep of the house of Israel."
But she came and knelt before Him, saying, "Lord, help me!"
But He answered, "It is not good to take the children's bread and throw it to the little dogs."
But she said, 'Yes, Lord; even the little dogs eat the crumbs that fall from their masters' table.'
Then Jesus answered her, 'O woman, great is your faith! Let it be done for you as you desire.' And her daughter was healed from that very hour.
And moving on from there, Jesus came by the Sea of Galilee, and after going up onto the mountain, He sat down there.
And great crowds came to Him, bringing with them the lame, the blind, the mute, the crippled, and many others; and they laid them down at Jesus’ feet, and He healed them.
So that the crowds marveled, seeing the mute speaking, the crippled healthy, the lame walking, and the blind seeing; and they glorified the God of Israel.
Then Jesus called His disciples to Him and said, 'I feel deep compassion for this crowd, for they have been with Me for three days and have nothing to eat. I do not want to send them away hungry, lest they faint on the journey.'
And His disciples said to Him, 'Where could we find enough bread in this wilderness to satisfy such a great crowd?'
And Jesus said to them, 'How many loaves do you have?' They replied, 'Seven, and a few small fish.'
And He commanded the crowds to sit down on the ground.
And taking the seven loaves and the fish, He gave thanks, broke them, and gave them to His disciples, and the disciples distributed them to the crowds.
And they all ate and were filled, and they took up the leftover fragments, seven baskets full.
Now those who ate were four thousand men, besides women and children.
And after sending the crowds away, He got into the boat and went to the region of Magdala.
And the Pharisees and Sadducees came to Him, testing Him, and asked Him to show them a sign from heaven.
But He answered them, 'When evening comes, you say, 'It will be fair weather, for the sky is red.'
And in the morning, you say, 'Today will be stormy, for the sky is gloomy.' You know how to interpret the appearance of the sky, but you cannot discern the signs of the times.
A wicked and adulterous generation seeks for a sign, but no sign will be given to it, except for the sign of Jonah the prophet." And He left them and departed.
And when His disciples came to the other side, they had forgotten to bring bread.
But Jesus said to them, "Take heed and beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees."
But they were reasoning among themselves, saying, "It is because we brought no bread."
But Jesus, aware of this, said to them, "Why are you discussing among yourselves about having no bread, O you of little faith?"
Do you not yet understand or remember the five loaves of the five thousand, and how many baskets you took up?
Nor the seven loaves from the four thousand, and how many baskets you gathered?
How do you not understand that I was not speaking about bread? But beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees.
Then they understood that He was not warning them to beware of the leaven of bread, but of the teachings of the Pharisees and Sadducees.
When Jesus came into the region of Caesarea Philippi, He asked His disciples, 'Who do people say that the Son of Man is?'
And they said, 'Some say John the Baptist, others say Elijah, and still others say Jeremiah or one of the prophets.'
But what about you? Who do you say I am?
Simon Peter replied, 'You are the Messiah, the Son of the Living God.'
And Jesus answered him, 'Blessed are you, Simon Bar-Jonah, for flesh and blood has not revealed this to you, but my Father who is in heaven.'
And I tell you that you are Peter, and on this rock, I will build my church, and the gates of hell will not prevail against it.
And I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven; whatever you bind on earth shall be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.
Then He commanded His disciples not to tell anyone that He was the Christ.
From that time onward, Jesus began to reveal to His disciples that He must go to Jerusalem and suffer many things from the elders, chief priests, and scribes, and be killed, and on the third day rise again.
And Peter took Him aside and began to sharply rebuke Him, saying, "God forbid, Lord; this shall never happen to You!"
But He turned and said to Peter, "Get behind Me, Satan! You are an offense to Me, for you are not mindful of the things of God, but the things of men."
Then Jesus said to His disciples, "If anyone wants to follow Me, let him deny himself, take up his cross, and follow Me."
For whoever desires to save his life will lose it; but whoever loses his life for my sake will find it.
For what will it profit a man if he gains the whole world but loses his own soul? Or what will a man give in exchange for his soul?
For the Son of Man is about to come in the glory of His Father, accompanied by His angels, and then He will reward each person according to their deeds.
Truly, I say to you, there are some standing here who will not taste death until they see the Son of Man coming in His kingdom.
After six days, Jesus took Peter, James, and John, his brother, and led them up a high mountain by themselves.
And He was transfigured before them; His face shone like the sun, and His garments became as white as light.
And behold, Moses and Elijah appeared to them, conversing with Him.
Responding, Peter said to Jesus, 'Lord, it is good for us to be here. If you wish, I will set up three shelters here—one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah.'
While he was still speaking, a bright cloud overshadowed them, and behold, a voice out of the cloud said, 'This is my beloved Son, in whom I take delight; listen to him!'
And when the disciples heard this, they fell on their faces and were greatly afraid.
And Jesus came and touched them, saying, "Rise, and do not be afraid."
And when they lifted up their eyes, they saw no one except Jesus alone.
And as they were coming down from the mountain, Jesus commanded them, saying, "Tell no one about the vision until the Son of Man is raised from the dead."
And the disciples asked him, saying, "Why then do the scribes say that Elijah must come first?"
But Jesus answered them, 'Indeed, Elijah is coming first and will restore all things.'
But I tell you, Elijah has already come, and they did not recognize him, but did to him whatever they wished. In the same way, the Son of Man is going to suffer at their hands.
Then the disciples understood that He was speaking to them about John the Baptist.
And when they approached the crowd, a man came and knelt before Him, saying,
Lord, have mercy on my son, for he is epileptic and suffers severely; for he often falls into the fire and often into the water.
I brought him to Your disciples, but they were unable to heal him.
Jesus replied, 'O unbelieving and perverse generation! How long must I be with you? How long must I put up with you? Bring the boy here to Me.'
And Jesus rebuked him, and the demon came out of him, and the boy was healed from that very hour.
Then the disciples approached Jesus privately and asked, 'Why were we unable to cast it out?'
Jesus replied, 'It is because of your lack of faith. Truly I tell you, if you have faith as small as a mustard seed, you can say to this mountain, “Move from here to there,” and it will move; nothing will be impossible for you.'
However, this kind does not go out except by prayer and fasting.
As they were gathering in Galilee, Jesus said to them, 'The Son of Man is about to be handed over into the hands of men.'
and they will kill him, and on the third day he will be raised up.' And they were greatly distressed.
When they arrived in Capernaum, those who collected the temple tax approached Peter and asked, 'Does your teacher not pay the temple tax?'
He said, 'Yes.' And when he entered the house, Jesus anticipated him, saying, 'What do you think, Simon? From whom do the kings of the earth take tolls or taxes? From their own sons or from others?'
Peter replied, 'From others.' Jesus said to him, 'Then the sons are free.'
But to avoid causing offense to them, go to the sea, cast a hook, and take the first fish that comes up. When you open its mouth, you will find a coin; take that and give it to them for me and you.
At that time, the disciples approached Jesus and asked, 'Who then is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven?'
And Jesus called a child to Him and set him in the midst of them.
Truly, I say to you, unless you turn and become like little children, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven.
Therefore, whoever humbles himself like this child is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven.
And whoever receives a child like this in my name welcomes me.
But whoever causes one of these little ones who believe in me to stumble, it would be better for him to have a heavy millstone hung around his neck and to be drowned in the depths of the sea.
Woe to the world because of stumbling blocks! For it is necessary that stumbling blocks come; but woe to the person through whom the stumbling block comes!
And if your hand or your foot causes you to stumble, cut it off and throw it away from you. It is better for you to enter life crippled or lame than to have two hands or two feet and be thrown into the eternal fire.
And if your eye causes you to stumble, tear it out and throw it away. It is better for you to enter into life with one eye than to have two eyes and be thrown into the fiery hell.
Take heed that you do not despise one of these little ones; for I tell you that their angels in heaven always behold the face of my Father who is in heaven.
For the Son of Man has come to seek and save that which was lost.
What do you think? If a man has a hundred sheep and one of them goes astray, will he not leave the ninety-nine on the mountains and go in search of the one that went astray?
And if he finds it, truly I say to you, he rejoices over it more than over the ninety-nine that did not go astray.
In the same way, it is not the will of your Father who is in heaven that one of these little ones should perish.
If your brother sins against you, go and tell him his fault, between you and him alone; if he listens to you, you have gained your brother.
But if he does not listen, take one or two others along with you, that every word may be confirmed by the testimony of two or three witnesses.
If he refuses to listen to them, tell it to the church; and if he refuses to listen even to the church, let him be to you as a Gentile and a tax collector.
Truly, I say to you, whatever you bind on earth shall be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.
Again, I tell you, if two of you agree on earth about anything they ask, it will be done for them by my Father in heaven.
For where two or three are gathered in my name, there am I among them.
Then Peter came up to Him and said, 'Lord, how often shall my brother sin against me, and I forgive him? Up to seven times?'
Jesus said to him, "I do not say to you up to seven times, but up to seventy times seven."
Therefore, the kingdom of heaven may be compared to a king who wished to settle accounts with his servants.
As he began to settle the accounts, one servant was brought to him who owed him ten thousand talents.
But since he could not pay, his master commanded that he be sold, along with his wife and children, and all that he had, so that payment could be made.
Falling on his knees, the servant implored him, saying, 'Master, be patient with me, and I will repay you everything.'
Moved with compassion, the master of that servant released him and forgave him the debt.
But that servant went out and found one of his fellow servants who owed him a hundred denarii; and he seized him, choking him, saying, 'Pay back what you owe!'
So his fellow servant fell down at his feet and begged him, saying, 'Be patient with me, and I will repay you all.'
But he refused and went away, and cast him into prison until he should pay back what was owed.
When his fellow servants saw what had happened, they were greatly distressed and went and reported to their lord all that had taken place.
Then his master summoned him and said to him, 'You wicked servant! I forgave you all that debt because you pleaded with me.'
Shouldn't you have had mercy on your fellow servant, as I had mercy on you?
And in anger, his master delivered him to the tormentors until he should repay all that was owed.
So likewise shall my heavenly Father do to you, if each of you from your heart does not forgive his brother his trespasses.
Now it came to pass, when Jesus had finished these sayings, He departed from Galilee and went to the borders of Judea, beyond the Jordan.
And great crowds followed Him, and He healed them there.
And the Pharisees approached Him, testing Him, and saying, ‘Is it permissible for a man to divorce his wife for any reason?’
He answered them, 'Have you not read that He who created them from the beginning made them male and female,'
And for this reason, a man shall leave his father and mother and be united with his wife, and the two shall become one flesh.
So they are no longer two, but one flesh. Therefore, what God has joined together, let not man separate.
They said to Him, 'Why then did Moses command to give a certificate of divorce and to send her away?'
He said to them, 'Moses permitted you to divorce your wives because of the hardness of your hearts; but it was not so from the beginning.'
And I say to you, whoever divorces his wife, except for the reason of sexual immorality, and marries another, commits adultery; and whoever marries a woman who has been divorced commits adultery.
The disciples said to Him, "If such is the case of a man with his wife, it is better not to marry."
But He said to them, 'Not everyone can accept this teaching, but only those to whom it has been given.'
For there are eunuchs who were born so from their mother's womb, and there are eunuchs who were made eunuchs by men, and there are eunuchs who have made themselves eunuchs for the sake of the Kingdom of Heaven. He who is able to accept it, let him accept it.
Then children were brought to Him so that He might lay His hands on them and pray; but the disciples rebuked them.
But Jesus said, "Let the little children come to me and do not hinder them, for the kingdom of heaven belongs to such as these."
And after laying his hands on them, he departed from there.
And behold, one came up to Him and said, 'Good Teacher, what good deed must I do to gain eternal life?'
But He said to him, 'Why do you call Me good? No one is good except the one, God. If you wish to enter into life, keep the commandments.'
He said to him, 'Which ones?' Jesus replied, 'You shall not murder, you shall not commit adultery, you shall not steal, you shall not bear false witness.'
Honor your father and mother, and you shall love your neighbor as yourself.
The young man said to Him, "I have observed all these things from my youth. What do I still lack?"
Jesus said to him, 'If you wish to be perfect, go, sell your possessions and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; then come, follow me.'
But when the young man heard this statement, he went away sorrowful, for he had many possessions.
But Jesus said to His disciples, "Truly I say to you, it is hard for a rich person to enter the kingdom of heaven."
Again I tell you, it is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than for a rich person to enter the kingdom of God.
When the disciples heard this, they were greatly astonished and said, "Then who can be saved?"
But Jesus looked at them and said, "With man this is impossible, but with God, all things are possible."
Then Peter responded and said to Him, "Look, we have left everything and followed You. What then will there be for us?"
And Jesus said to them, "Truly I say to you, that you who have followed Me will, in the regeneration, when the Son of Man sits on His glorious throne, also sit on twelve thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel."
And everyone who has left houses or brothers or sisters or father or mother or wife or children or fields for my name’s sake will receive a hundredfold and will inherit eternal life.
But many who are seen as first will be last, and those who are regarded as last will be first.
For the kingdom of heaven is like a landowner who went out early in the morning to hire laborers for his vineyard.
And having agreed with the laborers for a denarius for the day, he sent them into his vineyard.
And going out about the third hour, he saw others standing still in the marketplace.
And he said to them, ‘Go you also into the vineyard, and whatever is just, I will give you.’
They went out again. About the sixth and the ninth hour, he did the same.
And about the eleventh hour, he went out and found others standing idle, and he said to them, 'Why have you been standing here all day long without work?'
They replied to him, 'No one has hired us.' He said to them, 'You go into the vineyard too, and whatever is fair, you shall receive.'
When evening came, the owner of the vineyard said to his steward, ‘Call the laborers and give them their wages, starting from the last to the first.’
And those who came about the eleventh hour received a denarius each.
But when the first came, they assumed they would receive more, yet they also received each a denarius.
And upon receiving their payment, they began to grumble against the master of the house.
saying, ‘These last worked only one hour, and you have made them equal to us, who have borne the burden of the day and the scorching heat.’
But he answered one of them, 'Friend, I am not being unjust to you; did we not agree on a denarius?'
Take what is yours and go. I choose to give this last one the same as I give you.
Is it not permissible for me to do what I wish with what belongs to me? Or is your eye envious because I am good?
Thus, the last will be first, and the first will be last; for many are called, but few are chosen.
As Jesus was ascending to Jerusalem, He took the twelve disciples aside privately along the way and said to them:
Behold, we are going up to Jerusalem, and the Son of Man will be handed over to the chief priests and the scribes, and they will condemn Him to death.
and they will hand Him over to the Gentiles to be mocked and scourged and crucified, and on the third day He will rise again.
Then the mother of the sons of Zebedee approached Him, bowing down and asking Him for something.
And He said to her, 'What do you wish?' She said to Him, 'Grant that these two sons of mine may sit, one on Your right hand and the other on Your left, in Your kingdom.'
But Jesus answered and said, 'You do not know what you are asking. Are you able to drink the cup that I am about to drink, or be baptized with the baptism with which I am to be baptized?' They said to Him, 'We are able.'
He said to them, 'You will indeed drink from my cup, and be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with; but to sit at my right hand and at my left is not mine to grant, but is for those for whom it has been prepared by my Father.'
And when the ten heard it, they became indignant about the two brothers.
But Jesus called them to Himself and said, 'You know that the rulers of the Gentiles exercise dominion over them, and their great ones wield authority over them.'
It shall not be this way among you; rather, whoever wishes to be great among you must be your servant.
And whoever wishes to be first among you shall be your servant.
Just as the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give His life as a ransom for many.
As they were leaving Jericho, a large crowd followed Him.
And behold, two blind men were sitting by the roadside, and when they heard that Jesus was passing by, they cried out, saying, ‘Lord, Son of David, have mercy on us!'
But the crowd rebuked them, telling them to be quiet; yet they shouted all the more, ‘Lord, Son of David, have mercy on us!'
And Jesus stood still and called them, saying, 'What do you want Me to do for you?'
They said to Him, 'Lord, let our eyes be opened.'
Moved with compassion, Jesus touched their eyes; immediately their sight was restored, and they followed Him.
And as they drew near to Jerusalem, and came to Bethphage at the Mount of Olives, then Jesus sent two of His disciples.
saying to them, 'Go into the village that is opposite you, and immediately you will find a donkey tied, and a colt with her; untie them and bring them to Me.
And if anyone says anything to you, you shall say, 'The Lord has need of them'; and immediately he will send them.
This all happened so that what was spoken through the prophet might be fulfilled.
Say to the daughter of Zion, ‘Behold, your king is coming to you, gentle and riding on a donkey, on a colt, the foal of a donkey.’
The disciples went and did as Jesus instructed them.
They brought the donkey and the colt to Jesus and laid their garments on them, and he sat upon them.
And the most part of the crowd spread their cloaks on the road, while others cut branches from the trees and spread them along the way.
The crowds that went ahead of him and those that followed shouted, 'Hosanna to the Son of David! Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord! Hosanna in the highest!'
And when he entered Jerusalem, the whole city was stirred, asking, 'Who is this?'
And the crowds were saying, 'This is Jesus, the prophet from Nazareth of Galilee.'
And Jesus entered the temple of God and drove out all who were selling and buying in the temple, and He overturned the tables of the money changers and the seats of those selling doves.
And He said to them, 'It is written, My house shall be called a house of prayer; but you have made it a den of robbers.'
And the blind and the lame came to Him in the temple, and He healed them.
But when the chief priests and the scribes saw the wonderful things that He did, and the children shouting in the temple and saying, 'Hosanna to the Son of David!' they were indignant.
And they said to Him, 'Do You hear what these are saying?' And Jesus said to them, 'Yes, have you never read, ‘Out of the mouths of infants and nursing babies You have prepared praise’?
And leaving them, He went out of the city to Bethany and spent the night there.
Early in the morning, as He was returning to the city, He became hungry.
And seeing a fig tree by the road, He approached it, but found nothing on it except leaves. And He said to it, 'May you never bear fruit again!' Immediately, the fig tree withered away.
And when the disciples saw it, they marveled, saying, 'How did the fig tree wither away so soon?'
But Jesus answered them, 'Truly, I tell you, if you have faith and do not doubt, you will not only do what was done to the fig tree, but even if you say to this mountain, ‘Be taken up and thrown into the sea,’ it will happen.
And whatever you ask in prayer, believing, you will receive.
And when He entered the temple, the chief priests and the elders of the people came to Him as He was teaching, and said, "By what authority are You doing these things? And who gave You this authority?"
Jesus answered them, 'I will ask you one question; if you answer me, I will tell you by what authority I do these things.'
The baptism of John—was it from heaven or from men?" They deliberated among themselves, saying, 'If we say, 'From heaven,' He will ask us, 'Why then did you not believe him?'
But if we say, 'From men,' we fear the crowd, for they all regard John as a prophet.
And they answered Jesus, 'We do not know.' He said to them, 'Neither will I tell you by what authority I do these things.'
But what do you think? A man had two sons, and he went to the first and said, 'Son, go work today in my vineyard.'
He answered, 'I will not,' but later he changed his mind and went.
And coming to the second, he said the same thing. The son replied, ‘I will, sir,’ but he did not go.
Which of the two did the will of his father? They said, 'The first.' Jesus said to them, 'Truly, I say to you, that the tax collectors and the prostitutes are entering the kingdom of God before you.'
For John came to you in the way of righteousness, and you did not believe him; but the tax collectors and the prostitutes believed him, and even when you saw it, you did not afterward change your minds and believe him.
Listen to another parable: There was a master of a house who planted a vineyard, put a fence around it, dug a winepress in it, and built a tower. Then he leased it to tenants and went away.
When the time for the harvest drew near, he sent his servants to the tenants to collect his fruit.
And the farmers took his servants; they beat one, killed another, and stoned a third.
Again he sent more servants than the first; and they did the same to them.
Later, he sent his son to them, saying, 'They will surely respect my son.'
But when the farmers saw the son, they said to one another, 'This is the heir; come, let us kill him and seize his inheritance.'
And they took him, threw him out of the vineyard, and killed him.
When therefore the lord of the vineyard comes, what will he do to those tenants?
They said to Him, 'He will bring those wretches to a miserable end, and lease the vineyard to other farmers who will give Him the fruits in their seasons.'
Jesus said to them, 'Have you never read in the Scriptures: The stone which the builders rejected has become the cornerstone? This was the Lord's doing, and it is marvelous in our eyes?'
Therefore, I say to you that the kingdom of God will be taken from you and given to a nation producing its fruits.
And he who falls on this stone will be broken; but on whomever it falls, it will crush him.
And when the chief priests and the Pharisees heard His parables, they understood that He was speaking about them.
And they sought to seize Him, but feared the crowds, because they regarded Him as a prophet.
And Jesus answered and spoke to them again in parables, saying:
The kingdom of heaven is like a king who prepared a wedding feast for his son.
And he sent his servants to call those who had been invited to the wedding feast, but they were not willing to come.
Again he sent other servants, saying, ‘Tell those who have been invited, Behold, I have prepared my banquet; my oxen and fatted calves are killed, and all things are ready. Come to the wedding feast.'
But they paid no attention and went away, one to his own field, another to his business.
But the rest seized his servants, insulted them, and killed them.
But when the king heard about it, he was enraged, and he sent his armies to destroy those murderers and to set their city on fire.
Then he said to his servants, 'The wedding feast is ready, but those who were invited were not worthy.'
Go therefore to the intersections of the roads, and invite as many as you find to the wedding feast.
And those servants went out into the streets and gathered all whom they found, both bad and good; and the wedding hall was filled with guests.
But when the king came in to see the guests, he noticed there a man who was not wearing wedding clothes.
And he said to him, ‘Friend, how did you get in here without wedding clothes?’ And the man was speechless.
Then the king said to the servants, ‘Bind his feet and hands, take him away, and throw him into the outer darkness; in that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.’
For many are invited, but few are chosen.
Then the Pharisees went and plotted how they might entangle Him in His words.
And they sent their disciples to Him, along with the Herodians, saying, "Teacher, we know that You are truthful and teach the way of God in truth, and You do not care about anyone’s opinion, for You do not judge by outward appearances."
So tell us, what do You think? Is it lawful to give a tribute to Caesar or not?
But Jesus, knowing their malice, said, "Why do you test me, you hypocrites?"
Show Me the coin used for the tax.' And they brought Him a denarius.
And He asked them, 'Whose likeness and inscription is this?'
They said to Him, 'Caesar's.' And He replied to them, 'Therefore render to Caesar what belongs to Caesar, and to God what belongs to God.'
And when they heard this, they were astonished; and leaving Him, they went away.
On that day, the Sadducees approached Him, those who say there is no resurrection, and they questioned Him.
saying, "Teacher, Moses said that if a man dies without having children, his brother must marry the widow and raise up offspring for his brother."
Now there were seven brothers with us. The first married and died, and having no offspring, he left his wife to his brother.
In the same way, the second and the third, until all seven had married her.
Finally, after them all, the woman also died.
In the resurrection, whose wife will the woman be? For all seven had her as a wife.
Jesus answered and said to them, "You are mistaken, not knowing the Scriptures nor the power of God."
For in the resurrection, they neither marry nor are given in marriage, but are like angels of God in heaven.
But concerning the resurrection of the dead, have you not read what was spoken to you by God, saying,
‘I am the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.’ He is not the God of the dead, but of the living.
And when the crowds heard this, they were filled with wonder at his teaching.
But when the Pharisees heard that He had silenced the Sadducees, they gathered together in one place.
And one of them, an expert in the law, approached Him, testing Him and saying.
Teacher, which commandment is the greatest in the Law?
Jesus said to him, ‘You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your mind.’
This is the first and greatest commandment.
And a second is like it: You shall love your neighbor as yourself.
On these two commandments depend all the Law and the Prophets.
While the Pharisees were gathered together, Jesus asked them a question.
He asked them, 'What do you think about the Christ? Whose son is he?' They said to him, 'The son of David.'
He said to them, 'How then does David, by the Spirit, call him Lord, saying,
The Lord said to my Lord, 'Sit at my right hand until I make your enemies a footstool for your feet.'
If, then, David calls Him Lord, how can He be his son?
And no one was able to answer Him a word, nor did anyone dare to question Him anymore from that day forward.
Then Jesus spoke to the crowds and to His disciples.
saying, 'The scribes and the Pharisees have taken their seat in the seat of Moses.'
Therefore, all that they tell you to observe, you must keep and do; but do not follow their actions, for they say and do not practice.
For they bind heavy and unbearable burdens and lay them on the shoulders of men, but they themselves do not lift a finger to move them.
But all their works they do to be seen by men. They broaden their phylacteries and lengthen the tassels of their garments.
They love the places of honor at feasts and the best seats in the synagogues.
and they love greetings in the marketplaces and to be called 'Rabbi' by others.
But you are not to be called 'Rabbi,' for you have one Teacher, the Christ; and all of you are brothers.
And do not call anyone on earth your father, for you have one Father, who is in heaven.
And do not be called teachers, for you have one Teacher, the Christ.
But the greatest among you shall be your servant.
Whoever exalts himself will be humbled, and whoever humbles himself will be exalted.
Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you devour the houses of widows, and for a show make long prayers. Therefore, you will receive the greater judgment.
Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you shut the kingdom of heaven in front of men; for you do not enter yourselves, nor do you allow those who are entering to go in.
Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you traverse land and sea to make one proselyte, and when he is made, you make him twice as much a son of hell as yourselves.
Woe to you, blind guides! For you say, 'Whoever swears by the temple, it is nothing; but whoever swears by the gold of the temple is obligated.'
Foolish and blind! Which is greater, the gold or the temple that sanctifies the gold?
And whoever swears by the altar, it means nothing; but whoever swears by the gift that is upon it, is bound by his oath.
You foolish and blind! For which is greater, the gift or the altar that sanctifies the gift?
Therefore, the one who swears by the altar swears by it and by everything upon it.
And he who swears by the temple swears by it and by Him who dwells in it.
And he who swears by heaven swears by the throne of God and by Him who sits upon it.
Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you meticulously tithe mint, dill, and cumin, but you have overlooked the weightier matters of the law: justice, mercy, and faith. It is these you ought to have practiced, without neglecting the others.
Blind guides! You strain out a gnat but swallow a camel!
Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you clean the outside of the cup and the plate, but inside they are full of extortion and injustice.
You blind Pharisee! First cleanse the inside of the cup and the dish, so that the outside may also become clean.
Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you are like whitewashed tombs, which indeed appear beautiful outwardly, but inside are full of dead bones and all uncleanness.
So you also outwardly appear righteous to others, but within you are full of hypocrisy and lawlessness.
Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you build the tombs of the prophets and decorate the monuments of the righteous.
And you say, 'If we had lived in the days of our ancestors, we would not have taken part with them in shedding the blood of the prophets.'
Thus, you testify against yourselves that you are the descendants of those who murdered the prophets.
And so you have filled up the measure of your forefathers.
Serpents, offspring of vipers! How will you escape the judgment of hell?
Therefore, behold, I send you prophets and wise men and scribes; some of them you will kill and crucify, and some of them you will scourge in your synagogues and persecute from city to city.
so that upon you may come all the righteous blood shed on the earth, from the blood of righteous Abel to the blood of Zechariah son of Barachiah, whom you murdered between the sanctuary and the altar.
Truly, I say to you, all these things will come upon this generation.
O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, you who kill the prophets and stone those sent to you! How often I longed to gather your children together, as a hen gathers her chicks under her wings, but you were not willing!
Behold, your house is left to you desolate.
For I tell you, you will not see me again until you say, 'Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.'
As Jesus left the temple, his disciples came to him to point out the magnificent buildings of the temple.
But Jesus said to them, "Do you not see all these things? Truly I say to you, there will not be left here one stone upon another that will not be thrown down."
As He sat on the Mount of Olives, the disciples came to Him privately, saying, 'Tell us, when will these things happen, and what will be the sign of Your coming and of the end of the age?'
And Jesus answered and said to them, 'Take care that no one leads you astray.'
For many will come in my name, claiming, ‘I am the Christ,’ and will deceive many.
And you will hear of wars and reports of wars. See that you are not troubled, for these things must happen, but the end is not yet.
For nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom, and there will be famines and pestilences and earthquakes in various places.
All these are just the beginning of birth pains.
Then they will hand you over to be afflicted and will kill you, and you will be hated by all nations because of my name.
At that time many will stumble and will betray one another and will hate one another.
And many false prophets will arise and will deceive many.
And because lawlessness will abound, the love of many will grow cold.
But the one who perseveres to the end will be saved.
And this gospel of the Kingdom will be proclaimed throughout the whole world as a testimony to all nations, and then the end will come.
So when you see the abomination of desolation spoken of by the prophet Daniel standing in the holy place—let the one who reads understand—
Then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains.
Let the one who is on the housetop not go down to take anything out of his house.
And let the one who is in the field not turn back to take his cloak.
But woe to those who are pregnant and to those who are nursing infants in those days.
Pray that your escape may not occur in winter or on the Sabbath.
For then there will be great tribulation, such as has not occurred since the beginning of the world until now, nor ever will be.
And unless those days are shortened, no flesh would be saved; but for the sake of the elect, those days will be cut short.
Then if anyone says to you, ‘Look, here is the Christ!’ or ‘There He is!’ do not believe them.
For false Christs and false prophets will arise, and they will perform great signs and wonders, so as to lead astray, if possible, even the chosen ones.
Behold, I have warned you in advance.
So if they say to you, 'Look, He is in the wilderness,' do not go out; or, 'Look, He is in the inner rooms,' do not believe it.
For as lightning comes from the east and flashes to the west, so will be the coming of the Son of Man.
For wherever the corpse may be, there will the eagles be gathered together.
Immediately after the tribulation of those days, the sun will be darkened, and the moon will not give its light; the stars will fall from the heavens, and the powers of the heavens will be shaken.
And then the sign of the Son of Man will appear in heaven, and all the tribes of the earth will mourn; and they will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of heaven with great power and glory.
And He will send out His angels with a loud trumpet call, and they will gather His elect from the four winds, from one end of heaven to the other.
Now learn this lesson from the fig tree: When its branch becomes tender and its leaves sprout, you know that summer is near.
So, when you see all these things, understand that He is near, right at the door.
Truly, I say to you, this generation will not pass away until all these things take place.
Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will never pass away.
But concerning that day and hour, no one knows, neither the angels in heaven nor the Son, but only my Father alone.
But just as the days of Noah were, so will be the coming of the Son of Man.
For just as they were in the days before the flood, eating and drinking, marrying and being given in marriage, until the day Noah entered the ark,
And they did not know until the flood came and swept them all away, so will be the coming of the Son of Man.
Then two will be in the field; one will be taken, and one will be left.
Two women will be grinding at the mill; one will be taken, and one will be left.
Therefore, stay alert, for you do not know at what hour your Lord is coming.
But this you must understand, that if the householder had known at what time the thief was coming, he would have stayed awake and not allowed his house to be broken into.
Therefore, you also must be prepared, for at an hour you do not expect, the Son of Man will come.
Who then is the faithful and wise servant, whom his master has set over his household, to give them their food at the proper time?
Blessed is that servant whom his master finds doing so when he arrives.
Truly, I tell you, he will put him in charge of all his belongings.
But if that wicked servant says in his heart, ‘My master is delaying his coming,’
and begins to beat his fellow servants, and to eat and drink with the drunken.
The master of that servant will come on a day when he does not expect him, and at an hour he does not know.
And he will cut him in two, and appoint him a portion with the hypocrites; there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.
Then the kingdom of heaven will be like ten virgins who took their lamps and went out to meet the bridegroom.
Five of them were wise, and five were foolish.
The foolish ones took their lamps but did not take any oil with them.
But the wise took oil in jars along with their lamps.
As the bridegroom delayed, all the virgins became drowsy and fell asleep.
But at midnight, a shout was heard: 'Behold, the bridegroom is coming; go out to meet him!'
Then all those virgins arose and trimmed their lamps.
And the foolish said to the wise, 'Give us some of your oil, for our lamps are going out.'
But the wise answered, saying, 'Perhaps there will not be enough for us and for you; rather, go to those who sell and buy for yourselves.'
But while they were gone to buy oil, the bridegroom arrived. The prepared ones went in with him to the wedding feast, and the door was shut.
Later, the other virgins came and said, 'Lord, Lord, open the door for us!'
But he answered, 'Truly I say to you, I do not know you.'
Therefore, stay alert, for you do not know the day or the hour when the Son of Man will come.
For it will be like a man going on a journey, who called his own servants and entrusted to them his possessions.
To one he gave five talents, to another two, and to another one, each according to his own ability; and then he went away immediately.
Then he who had received the five talents went and traded with them, and made five more talents.
Likewise, the one who had received two talents gained two more.
But the one who had received the single talent went away, dug a hole in the ground, and hid his master's money.
After a long time, the master of those servants returned and settled accounts with them.
And he who had received the five talents approached, bringing five talents more, saying, 'Master, you entrusted me with five talents; see, I have gained five more talents on top of them.'
His master said to him, 'Well done, good and faithful servant! You were faithful over a little; I will set you over much. Enter into the joy of your lord.'
And he who had received the two talents came forward, saying, 'Master, you entrusted me with two talents; behold, I have gained two more talents beside them.'
His master said to him, ‘Well done, good and faithful servant! You have been faithful over a few things; I will set you over many things. Enter into the joy of your master.’
Then he who had received the one talent came forward and said, 'Master, I knew you to be a hard man, reaping where you did not sow and gathering where you scattered no seed.'
And filled with fear, I went away and hid your talent in the ground; look, here you have what is yours.
But his master answered him, ‘You wicked and slothful servant! You knew that I reap where I have not sown and gather where I have not scattered seed!'
Then you ought to have deposited my money with the bankers, and at my coming, I would have received it back with interest.
Therefore take the talent from him and give it to the one who has the ten talents.
For to everyone who has, more will be given, and he will have an abundance; but from the one who does not have, even what he thinks he possesses will be taken away from him.
And cast out the worthless servant into the outer darkness; there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.
When the Son of Man comes in His glory, and all the holy angels with Him, then He will sit on His glorious throne.
And before Him will be gathered all the nations, and He will separate them one from another, just as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats.
And He will place the sheep on His right hand, but the goats on His left.
Then the King will say to those on His right, ‘Come, you blessed of My Father; inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world.
For I was hungry, and you gave Me food; I was thirsty, and you gave Me drink; I was a stranger, and you took Me in.
I was naked, and you clothed me; I was sick, and you visited me; I was in prison, and you came to me.
Then the righteous will answer him, saying, 'Lord, when did we see you hungry and feed you, or thirsty and give you something to drink?'
When did we see you as a stranger and offer you a welcome, or naked and clothe you?
When did we see you ill or imprisoned, and come to you?
And the King will answer them, 'Truly, I say to you, as you did it to one of the least of these my brothers, you did it to me.'
Then he will say to those on his left, 'Depart from me, you cursed ones, into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels.'
For I was hungry, and you did not give me anything to eat; I was thirsty, and you did not give me anything to drink.
I was a stranger, and you did not welcome me; I was naked, and you did not clothe me; I was sick and in prison, and you did not visit me.
Then they will also answer Him, saying, 'Lord, when did we see You hungry or thirsty, or a stranger, or naked, or sick, or in prison, and did not minister to You?'
Then He will respond to them, saying, 'Truly I say to you, as much as you did not do it for one of the least of these, you did not do it for Me.'
And these will go away into eternal punishment, but the righteous into eternal life.
When Jesus had completed all these teachings, he said to his disciples,
You know that after two days, the Passover is coming, and the Son of Man will be handed over to be crucified.
Then the chief priests, the scribes, and the elders of the people gathered together in the courtyard of the high priest, who was called Caiaphas.
And they conspired together to seize Jesus by deceit and to put Him to death.
But they said, 'Not during the festival, lest there be an uproar among the people.'
Now Jesus was in Bethany, at the house of Simon the leper.
A woman approached Him, carrying an alabaster jar filled with very costly perfume, and she poured it upon His head while He was reclining.
But when His disciples saw it, they were greatly displeased, saying, 'Why this waste?'
For this fragrant oil could have been sold for a great price and the money given to the poor.
But Jesus, aware of this, said to them, "Why do you trouble the woman? For she has done a beautiful deed for Me.
For you will always have the poor among you, but you will not always have Me.
For when she poured this ointment on My body, she did it to prepare Me for burial.
Truly, I say to you, wherever this gospel is preached throughout the whole world, what she has done will also be told in remembrance of her.
Then one of the twelve, named Judas Iscariot, went to the chief priests and said to them,
What will you give me if I hand him over to you? And they counted out to him thirty pieces of silver.
And from that time, he sought an opportunity to hand him over.
On the first day of the Feast of Unleavened Bread, the disciples came to Jesus, asking, 'Where do You want us to prepare for You to eat the Passover?'
But He said, 'Go into the city to a certain man and tell him, 'The Teacher says, My time is near; I will celebrate the Passover at your house with My disciples.'
And the disciples did as Jesus had instructed them, and they made ready the Passover.
Now when evening had come, He reclined at the table with the twelve.
And as they were eating, He said, "Truly I say to you, that one of you will betray Me."
And they were greatly distressed, and began to say to Him, each one of them, 'Is it I, Lord?'
But He answered, 'The one who has dipped his hand with Me in the dish, he will betray Me.'
The Son of Man is going away as it has been written concerning Him. But woe to that man by whom the Son of Man is betrayed! It would have been better for that man if he had never been born.
Judas, the one betraying Him, replied, 'Surely, it is not I, Rabbi?' Jesus said to him, 'You have said it yourself.'
While they were eating, Jesus took bread, and after giving thanks, He broke it and gave it to His disciples, saying, 'Take and eat; this is my body.'
And he took the cup, and after giving thanks, he gave it to them, saying, 'Drink from it, all of you.'
For this is my blood of the new covenant, which is poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins.
But I tell you, I will not drink from this fruit of the vine from now until that day when I drink it anew with you in my Father’s kingdom.
And after singing a hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives.
Then Jesus said to them, "All of you will fall away because of Me this night; for it is written: 'I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock will be scattered.'"
But after I have been raised, I will go ahead of you to Galilee.
Peter replied, "Even if all others stumble because of you, I will never stumble."
Jesus said to him, 'Truly, I say to you, this very night, before the rooster crows, you will deny me three times.'
Peter replied to him, 'Even if I must die with you, I will never deny you.' And all the disciples said the same.
Then Jesus went with them to a place called Gethsemane, and he said to his disciples, 'Sit here while I go over there and pray.'
And taking with Him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, He began to be overwhelmed with sorrow and deep anguish.
Then Jesus said to them, 'My soul is filled with grief to the point of death. Remain here and stay awake with me.'
And going a little farther, He fell on His face and prayed, saying, 'My Father, if it is possible, let this cup pass from me; yet not as I will, but as You will.'
And He came to the disciples and found them sleeping; and He said to Peter, 'So, could you not watch with Me for one hour?'
Stay alert and pray, so that you do not fall into temptation; the spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak.
Again, He went away a second time and prayed, saying, 'My Father, if this cup cannot pass from Me unless I drink it, let Your will be done.'
And coming back, He found them again sleeping; for their eyes were heavy.
And leaving them, He went away again and prayed the same words a third time.
Then He came to His disciples and said to them, "Sleep on now and take your rest! Behold, the hour is at hand, and the Son of Man is being delivered into the hands of sinners."
Rise, let us be going; look, my betrayer is near.
While he was still speaking, behold, Judas, one of the twelve, arrived; and with him was a great crowd armed with swords and clubs, sent by the chief priests and the elders of the people.
Now the betrayer had given them a sign, saying, 'The one whom I kiss is the one; seize him.'
And immediately approaching Jesus, he said, 'Greetings, Rabbi,' and kissed Him.
But Jesus said to him, 'Friend, why have you come?' Then they came forward, laid hands on Jesus, and arrested Him.
And behold, one of those who were with Jesus stretched out his hand and drew his sword, and striking the servant of the high priest, he cut off his ear.
Then Jesus said to him, 'Put your sword back in its place, for all who take the sword will perish by the sword.'
Or do you think that I cannot presently appeal to my Father, and he would at once provide me with more than twelve legions of angels?
How then will the Scriptures be fulfilled, that it must happen this way?
At that hour, Jesus said to the crowds, 'Have you come out to seize me as you would a bandit, with swords and clubs? Every day I sat teaching in the temple, and you did not arrest me.
But all this has taken place so that the writings of the prophets may be fulfilled. Then all the disciples forsook Him and fled.
Those who had seized Jesus led Him away to Caiaphas the high priest, where the scribes and the elders had gathered.
But Peter followed Him at a distance, right up to the courtyard of the high priest, and entering in, he sat down among the servants to see the outcome.
Now the chief priests, the elders, and the entire council were seeking false testimony against Jesus in order to put Him to death.
But they found none; and although many false witnesses came forward, they found none. At last, two false witnesses came forward.
This man said, 'I am able to destroy the temple of God and rebuild it in three days.'
And the high priest arose and said to Him, 'Do You answer nothing? What is it that these men testify against You?'
But Jesus remained silent. And the high priest answered and said to Him, 'I put you under oath by the living God: Tell us if you are the Christ, the Son of God.'
Jesus said to him, 'You have said so. But I tell you, from now on you will see the Son of Man seated at the right hand of the Power and coming on the clouds of heaven.'
Then the high priest tore his robes, saying, 'He has spoken blasphemy! What further need do we have of witnesses? Behold, now you have heard His blasphemy!'
What do you think?' They answered, 'He is guilty of death.'
Then they spat in his face and struck him; and some slapped him.
saying, "Prophesy to us, O Christ! Who is it that struck you?"
Now Peter was sitting outside in the courtyard. And a servant girl came up to him and said, "You also were with Jesus of Galilee."
But he denied it in front of them all, saying, "I do not know what you are talking about."
When he had gone out to the gateway, another servant girl saw him and said to those nearby, "This man was with Jesus of Nazareth."
And again he denied it with an oath, saying, "I do not know the man."
After a little while, those who stood by approached Peter and said, 'Surely you are one of them; for your speech gives you away.'
Then he began to call down curses and swore an oath, saying, 'I do not know the man!' And immediately, a rooster crowed.
And Peter remembered the saying of Jesus, which had been spoken to him, 'Before the rooster crows, you will deny me three times.' And going outside, he wept with deep sorrow.
As morning dawned, all the chief priests and the elders of the people took counsel against Jesus to put Him to death.
And after binding Him, they led Him away and handed Him over to Pontius Pilate, the governor.
Then Judas, who had betrayed Him, seeing that He was condemned, felt remorse and returned the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and the elders.
saying, 'I have sinned, betraying innocent blood.' And they said, 'What is that to us? You will see to it.'
And throwing down the silver coins in the temple, he went away; and having departed, he hanged himself.
But the chief priests took the silver coins and said, 'It is not lawful to put these into the treasury, since it is the price of blood.'
And after taking counsel, they purchased the potter's field with those funds, to serve as a burial place for foreigners.
Therefore, that field was called the Field of Blood, a name it still bears to this day.
Then what was spoken through the prophet Jeremiah was fulfilled, saying: 'And they took the thirty pieces of silver, the price of Him who was valued, whom they of the children of Israel valued.'
And they gave the thirty pieces of silver to the potter's field, as the Lord had commanded me.
Meanwhile, Jesus stood before the governor, and the governor questioned Him, saying, 'Are you the king of the Jews?' Jesus answered him, 'You say so.'
And when He was being accused by the chief priests and the elders, He gave no answer.
Then Pilate said to Him, "Do you not hear how many things they testify against you?"
And He did not respond to him with even a single word, so that the governor was greatly amazed.
Now at the feast, the governor was accustomed to release one prisoner to the crowd, whom they wanted.
And they had then a notorious prisoner named Barabbas.
So when they had gathered together, Pilate said to them, 'Whom do you want me to release to you? Barabbas or Jesus, who is called the Christ?'
For he knew that it was out of envy that they had handed Him over.
While he was sitting on the judgment seat, his wife sent him a message saying, 'Have nothing to do with that righteous man, for I have suffered much today in a dream because of him.'
But the chief priests and the elders persuaded the crowds to ask for Barabbas and to have Jesus put to death.
The governor answered and said to them, 'Which of the two do you wish me to release to you?' They said, 'Barabbas.'
Pilate said to them, 'What then shall I do with Jesus who is called Christ?' They all answered, 'Let Him be crucified!'
But the governor said, 'What evil has He done?' And they cried out all the more, 'Let Him be crucified!'
When Pilate saw that he was getting nowhere, but instead a tumult was arising, he took water and washed his hands before the crowd, saying, ‘I am innocent of the blood of this righteous man. You will see to it.’
And all the people answered, ‘His blood be on us and on our children.’
Then he released to them Barabbas; but after having Jesus scourged, he delivered Him up to be crucified.
Then the soldiers of the governor took Jesus into the praetorium and gathered the whole battalion against Him.
And stripping Him of His garments, they dressed Him in a scarlet robe.
And they wove a crown from thorns and placed it upon His head, and they put a reed in His right hand. Then, kneeling before Him, they mocked Him, saying, 'Hail, King of the Jews!'
And they spat on Him, and taking the reed, they struck Him on the head.
And when they had mocked Him, they stripped Him of the robe and put His own clothes back on Him, and led Him away to be crucified.
As they were going out, they found a man of Cyrene, named Simon; they forced him to carry His cross.
And when they came to a place called Golgotha, which means 'the place of a skull,' they prepared for the execution.
They gave Him vinegar mixed with gall to drink; but when He tasted it, He would not drink.
And after they had crucified Him, they divided His garments among themselves, casting lots for them.
And sitting down, they kept watch over Him there.
And they placed above His head the charge against Him, which was written: This is Jesus, the King of the Jews.
Then two thieves were crucified with Him, one on the right and one on the left.
And those who passed by reviled Him, shaking their heads at Him.
And saying, 'You who are destroying the temple and rebuilding it in three days! Save Yourself; if You are the Son of God, come down from the cross!'
In the same way, the chief priests, along with the scribes and elders, mocked Him, saying,
He has saved others; He cannot save Himself. If He is the King of Israel, let Him come down now from the cross, and we will believe in Him.
He trusts in God; let God rescue Him now, if He desires Him; for He said, 'I am the Son of God.'
The same thing happened with the robbers who were crucified with Him; they also cast insults at Him.
Now from the sixth hour, darkness fell over all the land until the ninth hour.
About the ninth hour, Jesus cried out with a loud voice, saying, "My God, my God, why have you abandoned me?"
Some of those standing there, upon hearing it, said, 'This man is calling for Elijah!'
And immediately, one of those standing there ran and took a sponge, filled it with sour wine, and put it on a reed to give Him a drink.
But the others said, 'Let us see if Elijah comes to save him.'
But Jesus, once more crying out with a loud voice, yielded up His spirit.
And behold, the curtain of the temple was torn in two from top to bottom; and the earth shook, and the rocks were split.
And the tombs were opened, and many bodies of the holy ones who had fallen asleep were raised.
And coming out of the tombs after His resurrection, they entered the holy city and appeared to many.
But the centurion and those who were with him, watching over Jesus, when they saw the earthquake and all that had happened, were filled with great fear, saying, 'Truly, this was the Son of God!'
And there were many women there, observing from a distance, who had followed Jesus from Galilee, serving Him.
Among them was Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James and Joseph, and the mother of the sons of Zebedee.
As evening approached, a wealthy man named Joseph, who was from Arimathea, came to take the body of Jesus. He was also a disciple of Jesus.
This man went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus.
And taking the body, Joseph wrapped it in a clean linen cloth.
and laid it in his own new tomb, which he had hewn out of the rock. And he rolled a great stone to the entrance of the tomb and went away.
And there were Mary Magdalene and the other Mary sitting opposite the tomb.
The next day, which is after the Preparation, the chief priests and the Pharisees gathered together before Pilate.
saying, 'Sir, we remember that deceiver said, while He was still alive, ‘After three days I will rise.’
Therefore, command that the tomb be made secure until the third day, lest His disciples come by night and steal Him away, and say to the people, ‘He has risen from the dead,’ and the last deception will be worse than the first.
Pilate said to them, "You have a guard. Go, make it as secure as you know how."
So they went and made the tomb secure, sealing the stone and setting a guard.
Now after the Sabbath, as the first light of the week dawned, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary came to observe the tomb.
And behold, there was a great earthquake; for an angel of the Lord descended from heaven, rolled back the stone from the entrance, and sat upon it.
His appearance was like lightning, and his clothing was white as snow.
And because of their fear, the guards trembled and became as if they were dead.
But the angel answered and said to the women, "Do not be afraid; for I know that you seek Jesus who was crucified."
He is not here; for He has risen, just as He said. Come, see the place where the Lord lay.
And go quickly and tell His disciples that He has risen from the dead; and behold, He goes before you into Galilee; there you will see Him. Behold, I have told you.
And they quickly left the tomb with a mixture of fear and great joy, and ran to tell His disciples.
As they went to bring the news to His disciples, behold, Jesus met them, saying, 'Rejoice!' And they came and held His feet, and worshipped Him.
Then Jesus said to them, 'Do not be afraid; go and tell my brothers to go to Galilee; there they will see me.'
As they were on their way, some of the guard went into the city and reported to the chief priests all that had taken place.
And when they had gathered together with the elders and taken counsel, they gave a sufficient amount of silver to the soldiers, saying,
Say that His disciples came at night and stole Him away while we were sleeping.
And if this comes to the governor's ears, we will persuade him and keep you free from worry.
So they took the silver and did as they were instructed. And this report has been widely circulated among the Jews to this day.
Then the eleven disciples went to Galilee, to the mountain where Jesus had directed them.
When they saw him, they worshiped him; but some doubted.
And Jesus came and spoke to them, saying, 'All authority in heaven and on earth has been granted to me.'
Therefore, as you go, make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit,
Teaching them to observe all that I have commanded you. And behold, I am with you all the days, until the end of the age. Amen.
The beginning of the good news of Jesus Christ, the Son of God.
As it is written in the prophets, ‘Behold, I send my messenger before your face, who will prepare your way before you.’
A voice of one crying in the wilderness: ‘Prepare the way of the Lord; make His paths straight.’
John appeared, baptizing in the wilderness and proclaiming a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins.
And all the country of Judea and all Jerusalem were going out to him, and they were being baptized by him in the Jordan River, confessing their sins.
Now John was clothed with camel's hair, and wore a leather belt around his waist; and he ate locusts and wild honey.
And he proclaimed, saying, 'There comes one who is mightier than I after me, the strap of whose sandals I am not worthy to stoop down and untie.'
I indeed have baptized you in water, but He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit.
In those days, Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee and was baptized by John in the Jordan.
And immediately coming up from the water, he saw the heavens split open and the Spirit descending upon him like a dove.
And a voice came from the heavens: 'You are my beloved Son; in you I take great pleasure.'
And immediately the Spirit compelled Him to go out into the wilderness.
And He was in the wilderness for forty days, tempted by Satan; and He was with the wild animals, and angels were serving Him.
Now after John was arrested, Jesus came into Galilee, proclaiming the good news of the kingdom of God.
and saying, "The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God has drawn near; repent and believe in the good news."
As Jesus walked by the Sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and his brother Andrew casting a net into the sea; for they were fishermen.
And Jesus said to them, 'Come after me, and I will make you become fishers of men.'
And immediately, leaving their nets, they followed him.
And going a little further, he saw James the son of Zebedee and his brother John, who were in the boat, preparing their nets.
And immediately he called them, and leaving their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired servants, they went away to follow him.
And they entered Capernaum; and immediately on the Sabbath, He began to teach in the synagogue.
And they were astonished at His teaching, for He taught them as one having authority, and not as the scribes.
And in their synagogue there was a man with an unclean spirit, and he cried out.
Saying, 'What have you to do with us, Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are, the Holy One of God!'
But Jesus rebuked him, saying, 'Be silent and come out of him!'
And the unclean spirit convulsed him, and with a loud voice cried out and came out of him.
And all were astonished, so that they began to discuss among themselves, saying, 'What is this? What new teaching is this? For with authority He commands even the unclean spirits, and they obey Him!'
And immediately His fame spread throughout all the region of Galilee.
And immediately after leaving the synagogue, they went into the house of Simon and Andrew, accompanied by James and John.
But Simon's mother-in-law was lying in bed with a fever. And immediately they told him about her.
And He came to her, took her by the hand, and raised her up; and the fever left her instantly, and she began to minister to them.
When evening came, after the sun had set, they brought to Him all who were sick and those who were possessed by demons.
And the whole city was gathered together at the door.
And He healed many who were afflicted with various illnesses, and cast out numerous demons; and He did not permit the demons to speak, because they recognized Him as the Christ.
And in the morning, while it was still very dark, He rose and went out to a desolate place; and there He prayed.
And Simon and those who were with him searched for Him.
And when they found Him, they said to Him, "Everyone is searching for You."
And He said to them, 'Let us go to the nearby towns, so that I may preach there also; for this is why I have come.'
And He was preaching in their synagogues throughout all Galilee and casting out demons.
And a leper came to Him, beseeching Him, and kneeling down said to Him, "If You are willing, You can make me clean."
Then Jesus, filled with compassion, stretched out His hand and touched him, saying, 'I am willing; be cleansed.'
And when He had spoken, immediately the leprosy departed from him, and he was cleansed.
And sternly warning him, He immediately sent him away, saying to him,
"See that you say nothing to anyone, but go, show yourself to the priest, and offer for your cleansing what Moses commanded, as a testimony to them."
But as he went out, he began to proclaim widely and to spread the word, so that he could no longer enter a city openly, but remained outside in deserted places. And people came to him from every quarter.
And after some days, He returned to Capernaum, and it was reported that He was in the house.
And immediately many gathered together, so that there was no longer room to receive them, not even near the door; and He spoke to them the word.
Then they came to Him, bringing a paralytic, carried by four men.
And when they could not get near him because of the crowd, they removed the roof above where he was; and when they had made an opening, they let down the bed on which the paralytic lay.
And when Jesus saw their faith, he said to the paralytic, "Son, your sins are forgiven."
But there were some of the scribes sitting there and reasoning in their hearts.
Why does this man speak blasphemies like this? Who can forgive sins but God alone?
And immediately Jesus, perceiving in His spirit that they were reasoning this way within themselves, said to them, "Why are you pondering these things in your hearts?"
Which is easier to say to the paralytic: ‘Your sins are forgiven,’ or to say, ‘Get up, take your mat, and walk’?
But so you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins—He then spoke to the paralytic.
I tell you, arise, take up your bed, and go home.
And he arose immediately, and taking up the bed, he went out in front of them all, so that they were all amazed and glorified God, saying, "We have never seen anything like this!"
And he went out again beside the sea, and all the crowd was coming to him, and he was teaching them.
And passing by, He saw Levi the son of Alphaeus sitting at the tax booth, and He said to him, "Follow me." And rising up, he followed Him.
And it happened that as He was reclining at the table in His house, many tax collectors and sinners were dining with Jesus and His disciples; for there were many, and they followed Him.
And when the scribes of the Pharisees saw Him eating with the tax collectors and sinners, they said to His disciples, 'Why does He eat and drink with tax collectors and sinners?'
And hearing this, Jesus said to them, "It is not the healthy who need a physician, but those who are sick. I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance."
Now the disciples of John and the Pharisees were fasting. And they came and said to Him, "Why do the disciples of John and the Pharisees fast, but Your disciples do not fast?"
And Jesus said to them, "Can the sons of the bridechamber fast while the bridegroom is with them? As long as they have the bridegroom with them, they cannot fast."
But the days will come when the bridegroom is taken away from them, and then they will fast in those days.
No one sews a patch of unshrunk cloth on an old garment; otherwise, the new patch will pull away from the old, and a worse tear will result.
And no one puts new wine into old wineskins; otherwise, the new wine will burst the skins, and the wine will spill out and the skins will be destroyed. But new wine must be put into fresh wineskins.
One Sabbath, He was passing through the grain fields, and His disciples began to pluck the heads of grain as they went along.
And the Pharisees said to Him, "Look, why are they doing what is not lawful on the Sabbath?"
And He answered them, "Have you never read what David did when he had a need and was hungry, he and those who were with him?
How he entered the house of God in the time of Abiathar the high priest and ate the consecrated bread, which is not lawful for anyone to eat except for the priests, and he also gave it to those who were with him.
And he said to them, 'The Sabbath was made for the benefit of man, not man for the Sabbath.'
Thus, the Son of Man is Lord even of the Sabbath.
And he entered again into the synagogue; and there was a man there who had a withered hand.
And they closely observed Him to see if He would heal him on the Sabbath, so that they might accuse Him.
And He said to the man with the withered hand, "Stand up in the middle."
And He said to them, "Is it lawful to do good or to do harm on the Sabbath? To save a life or to kill?" But they were silent.
And after looking around at them with anger, grieved by the hardness of their hearts, He said to the man, "Stretch out your hand." He stretched it out, and his hand was restored to full health, just like the other.
And the Pharisees went out, and immediately they began to conspire with the Herodians against Him, how they might put Him to death.
And Jesus withdrew with His disciples to the sea; and a great multitude from Galilee followed Him.
And from Judea, Jerusalem, Idumea, beyond the Jordan, and the regions around Tyre and Sidon, a vast crowd came to Him, having heard about all the things He was doing.
And He instructed His disciples to have a small boat ready for Him because of the crowd, so that they would not crush Him.
For He had healed many, so that those who were troubled pressed in around Him to touch Him.
And whenever the unclean spirits saw Him, they fell down before Him and cried out, saying, 'You are the Son of God!'
And he sternly warned them not to make him known.
And He went up to the mountain, and called to Himself those whom He desired, and they came to Him.
And He appointed twelve, that they might be with Him, and that He might send them out to proclaim.
and to have authority to heal diseases and to cast out demons.
And He gave the name Peter to Simon.
And He named James, the son of Zebedee, and John, the brother of James; He gave them the name Boanerges, which means Sons of Thunder.
And Andrew, and Philip, and Bartholomew, and Matthew, and Thomas, and James the son of Alphaeus, and Thaddeus, and Simon the Zealot.
and Judas Iscariot, who also betrayed Him.
And they entered a house; and again a crowd gathered, so that they were not even able to eat bread.
And when His family heard of this, they went out to seize Him, for they said, 'He is out of His mind.'
And the scribes who had come down from Jerusalem were saying, 'He is possessed by Beelzebul, and by the chief of demons, He casts out demons.'
And calling them to Him, He spoke to them in parables, saying, 'How can Satan cast out Satan?'
And if a kingdom is divided against itself, that kingdom cannot stand.
And if a house is divided against itself, that house cannot stand.
And if Satan rises up against himself and is divided, he cannot stand, but his end has come.
No one can enter the strong man’s house and plunder his goods unless he first binds the strong man; then indeed he may plunder his house.
Truly, I say to you, all sins will be forgiven to the sons of men, and whatever blasphemies they may utter.
But whoever blasphemes against the Holy Spirit will never find forgiveness; he is guilty of an eternal sin.
For they were saying, 'He has an unclean spirit.'
Then His mother and His brothers came, standing outside and sending to Him, calling for Him.
And a crowd was sitting around Him, and they said to Him, "Look, Your mother and Your brothers are outside, seeking You."
And He answered them, saying, "Who are My mother and My brothers?"
And looking around at those seated in a circle around Him, He said, "Behold, My mother and My brothers!"
For whoever does the will of God, this one is my brother, and my sister, and my mother.
Again, He began to teach by the sea. And a great multitude gathered around Him, so that He got into a boat and sat in it on the sea; and the whole multitude was on the shore.
And He taught them many things in parables, and said to them in His teaching:
Listen! Behold, a sower went out to sow.
And as he was sowing, some seed fell along the path, and the birds came and ate it up.
And other seed fell on rocky ground, where there was not much soil, and it sprang up quickly because it had no depth of soil.
But when the sun rose, it was scorched; and since it had no root, it withered away.
And other seed fell among the thorns, and the thorns grew up and choked it, and it yielded no crop.
And other seed fell on the good ground, and it produced a crop that increased and grew, yielding thirtyfold, sixtyfold, and a hundredfold.
And He said to them, 'Whoever has ears to listen, let him listen!'
When He was alone, those around Him with the twelve asked Him about the parable.
And He said to them, "To you has been granted to know the secrets of the kingdom of God; but to those who are outside, all things are done in parables."
So that seeing they may see but not perceive, and hearing they may hear but not understand; otherwise they might turn, and their sins be forgiven them.
And He said to them, 'Do you not understand this parable? How then will you understand all the parables?'
The sower sows the word.
And these are the ones along the path where the word is sown; when they hear, immediately Satan comes and takes away the word that was sown in their hearts.
And these are the ones sown on rocky ground, who, when they hear the word, immediately receive it with joy;
and they have no root within themselves, but are only temporary; then, when trouble or persecution arises because of the word, they immediately stumble.
And these are the ones sown among thorns; they are the ones who hear the word.
But the cares of this age, the deceitfulness of wealth, and the desires for other things enter in and suffocate the word, and it becomes unfruitful.
And these are the ones sown on good soil: they hear the word, accept it, and produce fruit—thirtyfold, sixtyfold, and a hundredfold.
And He said to them, "Is a lamp brought in to be put under a basket or under a bed? Is it not to be set on a stand?"
For nothing is hidden that will not be revealed, nor has anything been kept secret but that it should come to light.
If anyone has ears to hear, let him listen.
And He said to them, "Take care what you listen to. With the measure you use, it will be measured to you, and even more will be added to you who hear."
For whoever has, to him more will be given; and whoever does not have, even what he seems to have will be taken away.
And He said, "The kingdom of God is as if a man should scatter seed on the ground.
And he sleeps and rises night and day, and the seed sprouts and grows; how, he does not know.
For the earth produces fruit by itself, first the blade, then the ear, and then the full grain in the ear.
But when the fruit is ready, immediately he sends out the sickle, because the harvest has come.
And He said, "With what can we compare the kingdom of God, or what parable shall we use to describe it?
It is like a mustard seed, which when sown on the ground, is the smallest of all the seeds that are upon the earth.
But when it is sown, it rises and becomes greater than all the herbs, and it puts forth large branches, so that the birds of the sky may nest under its shade.
And with many such parables He spoke the word to them, as they were able to hear.
Without a parable, He did not speak to them; but privately, to His own disciples, He explained everything.
And on that same day, when evening had come, He said to them, 'Let us go over to the other side.'
And leaving the crowd behind, they took Him along in the boat as He was; and there were also other boats with Him.
And a fierce windstorm arose, and the waves were crashing into the boat, so that it was already being swamped.
And he was in the stern, asleep on the cushion. And they woke him and said to him, "Teacher, do you not care that we are perishing?"
And upon awakening, he rebuked the wind and said to the sea, 'Be quiet! Be still!' And the wind ceased, and there was a great calm.
And he said to them, 'Why are you so afraid? How is it that you have no faith?'
And they were filled with a great fear and said to one another, 'Who then is this, that even the wind and the sea obey him?'
And they came to the other side of the sea, to the region of the Gerasenes.
And when He had stepped out of the boat, immediately a man with an unclean spirit met Him from the tombs.
He had his dwelling among the tombs, and no one could bind him, not even with chains.
For he had often been bound with shackles and chains, and he would tear apart the chains and break the shackles; no one was strong enough to subdue him.
Night and day, he roamed among the tombs and in the mountains, crying out and cutting himself with stones.
But when he saw Jesus from a distance, he ran and fell down before him.
And crying out with a loud voice, he said, "What have I to do with you, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? I implore you by God, do not torment me!"
For he had said to him, "Come out, you unclean spirit, from the man."
And He asked him, "What is your name?" And he replied, "My name is Legion, for we are many."
And they earnestly pleaded with Him not to send them out of that region.
Now there was a large herd of swine feeding on the mountainside.
And all the demons pleaded with Him, saying, 'Send us into the pigs, so that we may enter them.'
And Jesus immediately permitted them to leave. The unclean spirits went out and entered into the pigs; and the entire herd, numbering about two thousand, rushed down the steep bank into the sea and drowned in the waters.
And the herders of the pigs fled and reported the matter in the city and the countryside; and people went out to see what had taken place.
And they came to Jesus, and saw the man who had been possessed by the legion of demons, sitting there clothed and in his right mind; and they were afraid.
And those who had seen it told them how the demon-possessed man had been restored, along with the details concerning the pigs.
And they began to implore Him to depart from their region.
As Jesus was getting into the boat, the man who had been demon-possessed begged Him to let him go with Him.
But Jesus did not allow him, but said, 'Go home to your family and tell them all the wonderful things the Lord has done for you, and how He has had mercy on you.'
So he went away and began to proclaim in the Decapolis all that Jesus had done for him, and all were amazed.
And when Jesus had crossed over again in the boat to the other side, a great crowd gathered around him, and he was by the sea.
Then one of the leaders of the synagogue, named Jairus, came and fell at Jesus' feet.
He earnestly begged him, saying, 'My little daughter is at the point of death. Please come and lay your hands on her, so that she may be healed and live.'
So he went with him, and a great crowd followed, pressing in around him.
And there was a certain woman who had been suffering from a flow of blood for twelve years.
And having endured much at the hands of many physicians, and having spent all that she had, she was not helped at all, but instead grew worse.
Having heard about Jesus, she came up in the crowd behind him and touched the edge of his cloak.
For she said to herself, "If I just touch his clothes, I will be made whole."
And immediately the flow of her blood was dried up, and she felt in her body that she was healed of her affliction.
And immediately Jesus, knowing in Himself that power had gone out from Him, turned around in the crowd and said, "Who touched My garments?"
But His disciples said to Him, "You see the crowd pressing against You, and yet You say, 'Who touched Me?"
And He looked around to find out who had done this.
But the woman, knowing what had happened to her, came in fear and trembling, and fell down before Him and told Him the whole truth.
And He said to her, "Daughter, your faith has healed you. Go in peace, and be free from your suffering."
While He was still speaking, people came from the house of the synagogue leader, saying, "Your daughter has died; why trouble the Teacher any further?"
But Jesus, overhearing what was said, spoke to the synagogue ruler, 'Do not be afraid; only believe.'
And he did not allow anyone to follow him except Peter, James, and John, the brother of James.
And he came to the house of the ruler of the synagogue, and he observed a tumult, with many weeping and wailing loudly.
As he entered, he said to them, "Why are you making such an uproar and weeping? The child is not dead but is sleeping." And they laughed at him.
And after putting them all outside, he took the child's father and mother and those who were with him, and went in to where the child lay.
And taking the child by the hand, he said to her, 'Talitha, arise!' which means, 'Little girl, I say to you, arise.'
And immediately the girl rose up and walked; for she was twelve years old. And they were utterly astonished.
And He strictly ordered them that no one should know about this; and He said that she should be given something to eat.
Then He went out from there and came to His own hometown, and His disciples followed Him.
And when the Sabbath came, He began to teach in the synagogue; and many who heard Him were astonished, saying, "Where did this man get these things? And what is this wisdom that has been given to Him, and how are such miracles performed by His hands?"
Is this not the carpenter, the son of Mary, and the brother of James and Joses and Judas and Simon? And are not His sisters here with us?" And they took offense at Him.
But Jesus said to them, "A prophet is without honor only in his own country, among his relatives, and in his own household."
And He was unable to perform any mighty work there, except for laying His hands on a few sick people and healing them.
And He marveled at their unbelief. Then He went around the villages, teaching in their synagogues.
And He summoned the twelve and began to send them out two by two, giving them authority over unclean spirits.
And He instructed them to take nothing for the journey except a staff—no bread, no bag, and not even a copper coin in their belts.
But wear sandals, and do not put on two tunics.
And He said to them, 'Wherever you enter a house, stay there until you depart from that place.'
And wherever they do not receive you or listen to you, as you leave there, shake off the dust that is under your feet as a testimony against them. Truly, I say to you, it will be more bearable for Sodom and Gomorrah on the day of judgment than for that city.
So they went out and preached that people should repent.
And they drove out many demons, and anointed numerous sick people with oil and healed them.
And King Herod heard of Him, for His name had become widely known; and he said, "John the Baptist has risen from the dead, and therefore these powers are at work in him."
Some said, 'It is Elijah,' while others declared, 'It is a prophet, like one of the prophets of old.'
But when Herod heard of it, he said, 'John, whom I beheaded, has been raised from the dead.'
For Herod himself had sent and arrested John, and he bound him in prison because of Herodias, his brother Philip's wife, for he had married her.
For John was saying to Herod, "It is not lawful for you to have your brother's wife."
But Herodias harbored a grudge against him and wanted to kill him, but she could not.
For Herod feared John, knowing him to be a righteous and holy man; and he kept him safe. When he heard him, he was greatly perplexed, yet he enjoyed listening to him.
And when a suitable day arrived, Herod gave a banquet for his nobles, military commanders, and the leading men of Galilee.
And when Herodias’ daughter came in and danced, she pleased Herod and those reclining at the table with him. The king said to the girl, "Ask me for whatever you wish, and I will give it to you."
And he swore to her, "Whatever you ask of me, I will give you, up to half of my kingdom."
And she went out and said to her mother, 'What shall I ask for?' And she said, 'The head of John the Baptist.'
And she went in immediately with haste to the king and requested, saying, 'I want you to give me right now on a platter the head of John the Baptist.'
And the king, feeling distressed because of the oaths and those who were dining with him, did not wish to break his word to her.
And immediately, the king sent an executioner and commanded that his head be brought.
So he went and beheaded him in the prison; and he brought the head on a platter and gave it to the girl, and the girl presented it to her mother.
When his disciples heard of it, they came and took his body and laid it in a tomb.
And the apostles gathered together unto Jesus, and reported unto him all things, both what they had done and what they had taught.
And He said to them, "Come away by yourselves to a desolate place and rest a little while." For many were coming and going, and they had no opportunity even to eat.
So they departed to a deserted place by boat, privately.
But many saw them departing and recognized them; and they hurried on foot from all the towns and arrived at the place ahead of them.
And when Jesus came out, He saw a great multitude and was moved with compassion for them, because they were like sheep without a shepherd; and He began to teach them many things.
As the day was getting late, His disciples came to Him and said, "This place is desolate, and the time is already advanced."
Send them away, so that they may go into the surrounding countryside and villages to buy food for themselves; for they do not have enough to eat.
But he answered them, "You give them something to eat." And they said to him, "Should we go and spend two hundred denarii on bread to give them to eat?"
But He said to them, "How many loaves do you have? Go and see." And when they had found out, they said, "Five loaves and two fish."
And He instructed them to make everyone recline in groups upon the green grass.
So they reclined in groups, one hundred and one hundred, and fifty and fifty.
And taking the five loaves and the two fish, he looked up to heaven, blessed them, and broke the loaves. He then gave them to his disciples to distribute to the people, and he divided the two fish among them all.
And everyone ate and was filled.
And they picked up twelve baskets full of fragments, and from the fish.
And those who ate the loaves were five thousand men.
And immediately, He compelled His disciples to get into the boat and go ahead of Him to the other side, toward Bethsaida, while He dismissed the crowd.
And after bidding farewell to them, He went away to the mountain to pray.
And when evening came, the boat was in the middle of the sea, and He was alone on the land.
And He saw them straining at the oars, for the wind was against them. About the fourth watch of the night, He came to them, walking on the sea, and He intended to pass by them.
But when they saw Him walking on the sea, they thought He was a ghost, and they cried out in fear.
For they all saw Him and were troubled. And immediately He spoke with them and said, "Take courage; it is I; do not be afraid."
Then He went up into the boat with them, and the wind calmed down. They were utterly astonished within themselves.
For they did not understand the significance of the loaves; instead, their hearts were hardened.
When they had crossed over, they arrived at the land of Gennesaret and anchored there.
And when they had stepped out of the boat, they immediately recognized him.
They ran throughout the whole region and began to carry about on mats those who were sick, wherever they heard he was.
And wherever he entered, into villages, cities, or farms, they laid the sick in the marketplaces and implored him that they might touch even the fringe of his garment. And as many as touched it were made well.
And the Pharisees and some of the scribes gathered to Him, having come from Jerusalem.
And seeing some of His disciples eat with unclean hands, that is, unwashed, they found fault.
For the Pharisees and all the Jews, unless they wash their hands in a ritual manner, do not eat, holding fast to the tradition of the elders.
And when they return from the marketplace, they do not eat unless they have washed themselves. And there are many other traditions they observe, such as the washings of cups, pitchers, and kettles.
Then the Pharisees and the scribes asked him, 'Why do your disciples not walk according to the tradition of the elders, but eat with unwashed hands?'
He replied, ‘Isaiah was right when he prophesied about you hypocrites; as it is written: ‘These people honor me with their lips, but their hearts are far away from me.’
They worship me in vain; their teachings are but rules taught by men.
For you leave behind the command of God and hold fast to the tradition of men, such as the ritual washings of cups and pots, and many other similar things you do.
And He said to them, "You skillfully set aside the command of God in order to uphold your own tradition."
For Moses said, 'Honor your father and your mother'; and, 'Whoever speaks evil of father or mother must be put to death.'
But you say, ‘If a man says to his father or mother, “Whatever I could have benefited you with is a gift to God,”’
And you no longer allow him to do anything for his father or his mother.
Thus, you nullify the word of God by your tradition, which you have handed down; and you do many such things like this.
And calling the crowd to Him, He said to them, "Listen to me, all of you, and understand this."
There is nothing outside a person that can make them unclean by going into them. Rather, it is what comes out of a person that makes them unclean.

And when He had entered the house away from the crowd, His disciples asked Him about the meaning of the parable.
And He said to them, "Are you also so dull? Do you not perceive that whatever goes into a person from the outside cannot make them unclean?
For it does not enter into his heart, but into his belly, and is expelled into the latrine, thus declaring all foods clean.
And He said, "What comes out of a person is what defiles them."
For from within, out of the heart of men, come evil thoughts: adultery, fornication, murders.
Theft, greed, wickedness, deceit, sensuality, an evil eye, slander, pride, and foolishness; all these evil things come from within and defile a person.
All these wicked things come from within and corrupt a person.
And from there He arose and went to the region of Tyre and Sidon. He entered a house and did not want anyone to know it; yet He could not escape notice.
For a woman whose young daughter had an unclean spirit heard of Him and came and fell at His feet.
Now the woman was a Greek, a Syrophoenician by birth, and she begged Him to cast the demon out of her daughter.
But Jesus said to her, "Let the children be filled first, for it is not good to take the children's bread and throw it to the dogs."
But she answered and said to Him, 'Yes, Lord, yet the little dogs under the table eat from the children’s crumbs.'
And He said to her, 'For this saying, go your way; the demon has gone out of your daughter.'
And when she had returned to her home, she found her child lying on the bed, and the demon had departed.
Then Jesus went out again from the borders of Tyre and Sidon and came to the Sea of Galilee, through the midst of the region of the Decapolis.
And they brought to Him a deaf man who had difficulty speaking, and they pleaded with Him to lay His hand on him.
And taking him aside from the crowd, He put His fingers into his ears, and after spitting, He touched his tongue.
And looking up to heaven, He sighed deeply and said to him, 'Be opened!'
And immediately his ears were opened, and the bond of his tongue was loosened, and he spoke plainly.
And he sternly commanded them not to tell anyone. But the more he insisted, the more they proclaimed it.
And they were utterly astonished, saying, 'He has done all things well. He even makes the deaf hear and the mute speak.'
In those days, when there was again a great crowd with nothing to eat, Jesus called His disciples to Him and said to them:
I have compassion on the crowd, because they have been with Me now for three days and have nothing to eat.
And if I send them away hungry to their homes, they will faint along the way; for some of them have come from far.
His disciples answered Him, "How can anyone satisfy these people with bread here in this wilderness?"
And He asked them, "How many loaves do you have?" They replied, "Seven."
So He instructed the crowd to sit down on the ground. Taking the seven loaves, He gave thanks, broke them, and gave them to His disciples to set before the people. And they distributed them to the crowd.
They also had a few small fish; and after He had blessed them, He told them to set these before the people.
They ate and were satisfied; and they gathered up the leftover pieces, seven baskets full.
Now there were about four thousand people; and He sent them away.
And immediately He got into the boat with His disciples and came to the region of Dalmanutha.
Then the Pharisees came out and began to argue with Him, seeking from Him a sign from heaven, testing Him.
And sighing deeply in His spirit, He said, 'Why does this generation seek a sign? Truly, I say to you, no sign shall be given to this generation.'
And having left them, He went back into the boat again.
And they had forgotten to bring bread; and they had only one loaf with them in the boat.
And he warned them, saying, "Take heed; beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and the leaven of Herod."
And they began to discuss among themselves, saying, "We have no bread."
And Jesus, perceiving this, said to them, "Why are you reasoning about having no bread? Do you not yet perceive or understand? Is your heart still hardened?
Having eyes, do you not see? And having ears, do you not hear? And do you not remember?
When I broke the five loaves for the five thousand, how many baskets full of pieces did you take up? They said to Him, "Twelve."
And when I broke the seven loaves for the four thousand, how many baskets full of leftover pieces did you gather? They said to Him, "Seven."
And He said to them, 'Do you not yet comprehend?'
And He came to Bethsaida, and they brought a blind man to Him, and begged Him to touch him.
And taking the blind man by the hand, He led him out of the village; and after spitting on his eyes and laying His hands on him, He asked him, "Do you see anything?"
And when he looked up, he said, "I see people, like trees walking about."
Then he put his hands again on the man's eyes, and this time he was able to see clearly; his sight was completely restored, and he looked around and saw everything distinctly.
And He sent him home, saying, 'Do not enter the village, nor tell anyone there about what has happened.'
Jesus went out with his disciples to the villages of Caesarea Philippi. Along the way, He asked His disciples, "Who do people say that I am?"
And they answered, "John the Baptist; and others say Elijah; and still others, one of the prophets."
And He asked them, "But who do you say that I am?" Peter answered and said to Him, "You are the Christ."
And He strictly commanded them not to speak to anyone about Him.
And He began to teach them that the Son of Man must suffer many things, and be rejected by the elders, the chief priests, and the scribes, and be killed, and after three days rise again.
And He spoke openly about this. But Peter took Him aside and began to rebuke Him.
But turning around and seeing His disciples, He rebuked Peter, saying, "Get behind Me, Satan! For you are not setting your mind on the things of God, but on the things of men."
And summoning the crowd with His disciples, He said to them, "Whoever wishes to follow Me must deny himself, take up his cross, and follow Me."
For whoever desires to save his own life will lose it; but whoever loses his life for My sake and for the sake of the Gospel will save it.
For what does it benefit a person if he gains the whole world but forfeits his soul?
Or what will a man give in exchange for his soul?
For whoever is ashamed of me and my words in this adulterous and sinful generation, of him the Son of Man will be ashamed when he comes in the glory of his Father with the holy angels.
And He said to them, "Truly, I tell you, some of those standing here will not taste death until they see the kingdom of God come in power."
And after six days, Jesus took Peter, James, and John and led them up a high mountain privately. And He was transfigured before them.
And His garments became radiant, exceedingly white, like snow, such as no launderer on earth could bleach them.
And Elijah appeared to them with Moses, and they were conversing with Jesus.
Rabbi, it is good for us to be here. Let us make three shelters: one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah.
For he did not know what to say, for they were greatly afraid.
And there came a cloud that overshadowed them, and a voice came from the cloud, saying, 'This is My beloved Son; listen to Him.'
And suddenly, when they looked around, they saw no one anymore, but only Jesus with themselves.
As they were coming down from the mountain, He commanded them not to tell anyone what they had seen until the Son of Man had risen from the dead.
And they kept the word to themselves, questioning among themselves what the rising from the dead meant.
And they asked Him, saying, "Why do the scribes say that Elijah must come first?"
But He answered them, "Elijah truly comes first and restores all things. And how is it written concerning the Son of Man, that He must suffer many things and be treated with contempt?
But I tell you that Elijah has come, and they have done to him whatever they wished, just as it is written about him.
And when He came to the disciples, He saw a great crowd gathered around them, and scribes arguing with them.
And immediately, all the crowd, seeing Him, were amazed, and ran to Him and greeted Him.
And He asked the scribes, "What are you discussing among yourselves?"
And one from the crowd answered Him, 'Teacher, I brought my son to You, who has a mute spirit.'
And wherever it seizes him, it throws him down, and he foams at the mouth, grinds his teeth, and becomes rigid. So I told Your disciples to cast it out, but they could not.
He answered them, "O generation lacking in faith, how long must I be with you? How long must I endure you? Bring him to Me."
And when they brought him to Jesus, immediately the spirit convulsed him, and falling to the ground, he rolled around, foaming at the mouth.
And he asked the boy’s father, 'How long has he been like this?' And the father said, 'From childhood.'
And often he has thrown him both into the fire and into the water, intending to destroy him. But if you can do anything, have compassion on us and help us.
Jesus said to him, "If you are able to believe, all things are possible for the one who believes."
Immediately the father of the child cried out, "I believe; help my unbelief!"
And when Jesus saw that a crowd was gathering, He rebuked the unclean spirit, saying to it, "You deaf and mute spirit, I command you, come out of him and never enter him again."
And after crying out and convulsing him fiercely, it came out; and the boy appeared to be dead, so much so that many said, 'He is dead.'
But Jesus, taking him by the hand, raised him up; and he stood.
And when He entered the house, His disciples asked Him privately, 'Why could we not drive it out?'
And He said to them, 'This kind can only come out through prayer and fasting.'
And from there, they departed and traveled through Galilee, and He did not wish for anyone to know.
For He was instructing His disciples, saying to them, "The Son of Man will be handed over to men, and they will kill Him; and after He is killed, He will rise on the third day."
But they did not comprehend His statement, and they were afraid to question Him about it.
And He came to Capernaum. When He was in the house, He asked them, 'What were you discussing on the way?'
But they kept silent, for on the way they had argued with one another about who among them was the greatest.
And sitting down, He called the twelve and said to them, "If anyone desires to be first, he shall be last of all and servant of all."
And He took a child, set him in the midst of them, and embracing him, He said to them:
Whoever receives one of these little children in My name receives Me; and whoever receives Me does not just receive Me, but also Him who sent Me.
John answered Him, saying, 'Teacher, we saw someone casting out demons in Your name, and we forbade him because he does not follow us.'
But Jesus said, 'Do not hinder him, for no one who does a mighty work in My name will be able soon afterward to speak evil of Me.'
For whoever is not against us is for us.
For whoever gives you a cup of water to drink because you bear the name of Christ, truly I say to you, he will by no means lose his reward.
And whoever causes one of these little ones who believe in Me to stumble, it would be better for him if a heavy millstone were placed around his neck and he were thrown into the sea.
And if your hand causes you to stumble, cut it off; it is better for you to enter life maimed than to have two hands and go into hell, to the unquenchable fire.
where their worm does not die, and the fire is not extinguished.
And if your foot causes you to stumble, cut it off. It is better for you to enter into life lame than to be thrown with two feet into the unquenchable fire.
Where their worm does not die, and the fire is not quenched.
And if your eye causes you to stumble, cast it out. It is better for you to enter into the kingdom of God with one eye than to be cast into hell with two eyes.
where their worm does not die and the fire is not extinguished.
For everyone will be seasoned with fire, and every sacrifice will be salted with salt.
Salt is good, but if the salt loses its saltiness, how will you make it salty again? Have salt within yourselves, and be at peace with one another.
And from there, he arose and went to the borders of Judea and beyond the Jordan; and again, crowds gathered around him, and as was his custom, he began to teach them.
And the Pharisees approached him, questioning him, 'Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife?' They were testing him.
But he answered them, 'What did Moses command you?'
They said, 'Moses permitted a man to write a certificate of divorce and send her away.'
Jesus replied, "It was because of your hard hearts that Moses wrote you this commandment."
But from the very beginning of creation, God made them male and female.
For this reason, a man will leave his father and mother and be united with his wife,
So they are no longer two, but one flesh.
Therefore, what God has united, let no human separate.
And when they were in the house again, the disciples asked Him about this matter.
And He said to them, "Whoever divorces his wife and marries another commits adultery against her."
And if a woman divorces her husband and marries another, she commits adultery.
And people were bringing little children to Him, so that He might touch them; but the disciples rebuked those who brought them.
But when Jesus saw this, he became indignant and said to them, "Let the little children come to me; do not stop them, for to such belongs the kingdom of God."
Truly, I say to you, whoever does not receive the kingdom of God as a little child will never enter it.
And taking them in his arms, he blessed them, placing his hands upon them.
As he was setting out on his journey, a man ran up to him, knelt before him, and asked, "Good Teacher, what must I do to inherit eternal life?"
Jesus said to him, 'Why do you call me good? No one is good except God alone.'
You know the commandments: Do not commit adultery, do not murder, do not steal, do not give false testimony, do not defraud, honor your father and mother.
He answered, "Teacher, I have observed all these commands since my youth."
Jesus looked at him with love and said, "You lack one thing: Go, sell all that you have and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven. Then come, follow me, taking up your cross."
But he, taken aback by the saying, went away grieving, for he had many possessions.
And looking around, Jesus said to His disciples, "How hard it is for those who have riches to enter the kingdom of God!"
But the disciples were astonished at His words. Jesus answered them again, saying, "Children, how hard it is for those who trust in riches to enter the kingdom of God!"
It is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than for a wealthy person to enter the kingdom of God.
They were utterly astonished, saying to one another, 'Then who can possibly be saved?'
Jesus looked at them and said, "With man it is impossible, but not with God; for with God all things are possible."
Then Peter began to say to Him, 'Look, we have left everything and followed You.'
In reply, Jesus said, "Truly, I tell you, there is no one who has left home, or brothers, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or fields for my sake and for the sake of the Gospel,
but he will receive a hundredfold now in this time—houses, brothers, sisters, mothers, children, and fields, along with persecutions; and in the age to come, eternal life.
But many who are regarded as first will be last, and many who are regarded as last will be first.
They were on the road, ascending to Jerusalem, and Jesus was leading them; they were astonished, and those who followed were afraid. Again, He took the twelve aside and began to tell them what was going to happen to Him.
Behold, we are ascending to Jerusalem, and the Son of Man will be delivered to the chief priests and the scribes. They will condemn Him to death and hand Him over to the Gentiles.
And they will mock Him, and scourge Him, and spit on Him, and kill Him; and on the third day, He will rise again.
Then James and John, the sons of Zebedee, approached Him, saying, "Teacher, we want You to do for us whatever we ask of You."
But He said to them, 'What do you want Me to do for you?'
They replied, "Grant us to sit, one at Your right and one at Your left, in Your glory."
But Jesus said to them, "You do not understand what you are asking. Are you able to drink the cup that I drink, or to be baptized with the baptism with which I am baptized?"
And they said to Him, "We are able." Jesus replied, "You will indeed drink the cup that I drink, and with the baptism with which I am baptized, you will be baptized.
But to sit at My right hand or at My left is not Mine to grant, but is for those for whom it has been prepared.
And when the ten heard this, they began to feel indignant toward James and John.
But Jesus called them and said to them, "You know that those who are regarded as rulers of the Gentiles dominate over them, and their great ones exercise authority over them.
Yet it shall not be so among you. Whoever desires to be great among you must become your servant.
And whoever desires to be first among you shall be the servant of all.
For even the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give His life as a ransom for many.
Then they came to Jericho. As Jesus was leaving Jericho with His disciples and a large crowd, a blind man, Bartimaeus (which means 'son of Timaeus'), was sitting by the roadside begging.
And when he heard that Jesus of Nazareth was near, he began to shout and say, 'Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me!'
And many warned him to be silent, but he cried out all the more, 'Son of David, have mercy on me!'
And Jesus stood still and said, 'Call him.' So they called the blind man, saying to him, 'Take courage, rise; He is calling for you.'
And he, casting aside his cloak, sprang up and came to Jesus.
And Jesus, responding, said to him, 'What do you want me to do for you?' The blind man said to him, 'Rabboni, that I may regain my sight.'
And Jesus said to him, 'Go, your faith has healed you.' Immediately he received his sight and began to follow Jesus along the way.
As they approached Jerusalem, near Bethphage and Bethany, at the Mount of Olives, Jesus sent two of his disciples.
And He said to them, 'Go into the village ahead of you, and as you enter it, you will find a colt tied there, on which no one has ever sat. Untie it and bring it here.'
And if anyone says to you, ‘Why are you doing this?’ you shall say, ‘The Lord has need of it,’ and immediately he will send it back here.”
They went away and found the colt tied at a door outside on the street, and they untied it.
And some of those who stood there said to them, ‘What are you doing, untying the colt?’
They answered them just as Jesus had instructed, and they let them go.
And they brought the colt to Jesus and threw their garments upon it; and He sat upon it.
Many spread their garments on the road, while others cut leafy branches from the trees and spread them along the way.
And those who went ahead and those who followed were shouting, "Hosanna! Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord!"
Blessed is the coming kingdom of our father David, in the name of the Lord! Hosanna in the highest!
And Jesus entered into Jerusalem and went into the temple. After looking around at everything, it was already late in the evening, he went out to Bethany with the twelve.
And the next day, as they were leaving Bethany, Jesus felt hunger.
And seeing a fig tree from a distance with leaves, He went to see if perhaps He would find anything on it. But when He came to it, He found nothing but leaves; for it was not the season for figs.
And responding, He said to it, "May no one ever eat fruit from you again." And His disciples heard it.
And they came again to Jerusalem. And entering the temple, Jesus began to drive out those who sold and bought in the temple, and he overturned the tables of the money changers and the seats of those who sold pigeons.
And he did not permit anyone to carry a vessel through the temple.
And He taught them, saying, 'Is it not written that My house shall be called a house of prayer for all nations? But you have turned it into a den of robbers.'
And the scribes and the Pharisees and the chief priests heard it, and they sought how they might destroy Him; for they feared Him, because all the people were astonished at His teaching.
And when evening came, He went out of the city.
And as they passed by in the morning, they saw the fig tree dried up from the roots.
And Peter, remembering, said to Him, 'Rabbi, look! The fig tree which You cursed has withered away.'
And Jesus answered them, 'Have faith in God.'
Truly, I tell you, whoever says to this mountain, ‘Be taken up and thrown into the sea,’ and does not doubt in their heart but believes that what they say will come to pass, it will be done for them.
Therefore, I say to you, whatever you ask in prayer, believe that you have received it, and it will be yours.
And whenever you stand praying, if you hold anything against anyone, forgive them, so that your Father in heaven may forgive you your sins.
But if you do not forgive, neither will your Father in heaven forgive your transgressions.
And they came again to Jerusalem; and as He was walking in the temple, the chief priests, the scribes, and the elders came to Him.
And they said to Him, "By what authority are You doing these things? Or who gave You this authority to do these things?"
But Jesus answered and said to them, "I will ask you one question, and you answer Me: By what authority do I perform these things?"
Was John's baptism from heaven or from men? Answer me!
And they deliberated among themselves, saying, "If we say, 'From heaven,' he will ask, 'Why then did you not believe him?'
But if we say, 'From men,' they were afraid of the people, for everyone considered John to be a prophet.
And they answered Jesus, 'We do not know.' And Jesus said to them, 'Neither will I tell you by what authority I do these things.'
And He began to speak to them in parables: "A man planted a vineyard, and put a fence around it, and dug a winepress, and built a tower; then he leased it to tenant farmers and went away.
And at the proper time, he sent a servant to the tenants, so that he might receive from the tenants the fruit of the vineyard.
But they seized him, beat him, and sent him away empty-handed.
And again he sent to them another servant; and they stoned him, and wounded him, and sent him away dishonored.
And again he sent another servant; and they killed that one too. Many others were sent, some they beat, and others they killed.
He had yet one more to send, a beloved son. Finally, he sent him to them, saying, 'They will surely respect my son.'
But those tenants said to one another, 'This is the heir. Come, let us kill him, and the inheritance will be ours.'
So they took him, killed him, and threw him out of the vineyard.
What will the Lord of the vineyard do? He will come and destroy these tenants, and give the vineyard to others.
Have you not read this Scripture: 'The stone that the builders rejected has become the cornerstone'?
This was the Lord’s doing, and it is marvelous in our eyes?
And they sought to seize Him, but they were afraid of the crowd, for they understood that He had spoken this parable against them. So, leaving Him, they went away.
And they sent to Him some of the Pharisees and the Herodians to catch Him in His words.
And when they came, they said to Him, 'Teacher, we know that You are true and that You do not regard the person of men, but teach the way of God in truth. Is it lawful to pay taxes to Caesar or not? Should we pay them or should we not?'
But knowing their hypocrisy, He said to them, 'Why do you test Me? Bring Me a denarius, so that I may see it.'
They brought it to Him, and He said to them, "Whose likeness and inscription is this?" They replied, "Caesar's."
And Jesus answered them, "Give to Caesar what belongs to Caesar, and give to God what belongs to God." And they marveled at Him.
Then the Sadducees came to Him, who say there is no resurrection, and they asked Him, saying:
Teacher, Moses wrote for us that if a man's brother dies and leaves a wife but no children, his brother must take the wife and raise up offspring for his brother.
There were seven brothers. The first married a woman, and when he died, he left no children.
And the second brother took her as his wife, and he died as well, leaving no descendants; likewise, the third brother did the same.
And the seven took her, and they left no offspring. Last of all, the woman died.
In the resurrection, when they rise again, whose wife will she be? For the seven had her as a wife.
And Jesus answered them, "Are you not deceived because you do not know the Scriptures nor the power of God?"
For when they rise from the dead, they neither marry nor are given in marriage, but are like angels in the heavens.
But concerning the dead, that they rise again, have you not read in the book of Moses, at the burning bush, how God spoke to him, saying, 'I am the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob'?
He is not the God of the dead, but of the living. Therefore, you are greatly mistaken.
And one of the scribes came, having heard them debating, and perceiving that He answered them well, asked Him, 'What is the first commandment of all?'
Jesus answered him, 'The most important commandment is this: Hear, O Israel, the Lord our God, the Lord is one;'
And you shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, with all your mind, and with all your strength. This is the foremost commandment.
And the second is this: You shall love your neighbor as yourself. There is no commandment greater than these.
And the scribe said to Him, "Well said, Teacher; you have truly stated that He is one and that there is no other besides Him."
And to love Him with all your heart, with all your understanding, with all your soul, and with all your strength, and to love your neighbor as yourself is more important than all burnt offerings and sacrifices.
And when Jesus saw that he had answered wisely, He said to him, 'You are not far from the kingdom of God.' And no one dared to ask Him any more questions.
And Jesus, answering, taught in the temple, saying, 'How is it that the scribes say that the Christ is the Son of David?'
For David himself said in the Holy Spirit, 'The Lord said to my Lord, "Sit at my right hand until I place your enemies under your feet."'
David himself calls him Lord. So how can he be his son? And the great crowd listened to him with delight.
And he said to them in his teaching: "Beware of the scribes who desire to walk in long robes and love greetings in the marketplaces.
and the chief seats in the synagogues, and the places of honor at banquets.
They consume the houses of widows and for a show make long prayers. These men will receive the greater judgment.
And sitting down opposite the treasury, Jesus observed how the crowd was putting money into the treasury.
And a poor widow came and put in two small coins, which amount to a quadrans.
And calling his disciples to him, he said to them, "Truly, I tell you, this poor widow has put in more than all those who are contributing to the treasury."
For they all contributed out of their abundance; but she, out of her poverty, has put in everything she had, all she had to live on.
As Jesus was leaving the temple, one of his disciples said to him, "Teacher, look at these magnificent stones and buildings!"
Jesus replied to him, "Do you see these great buildings? Truly, I say to you, not one stone will be left here upon another; they will all be thrown down."
And while he was sitting on the Mount of Olives, opposite the temple, Peter, James, John, and Andrew asked him privately,
Tell us, when will these things happen, and what will be the sign that they are about to come to pass?
But Jesus, answering them, began to say: "Take heed that no one leads you astray."
For many will come in My name, declaring, 'I am the One,' and will lead many astray.
But when you hear of wars and reports of wars, do not be alarmed; it is necessary for these things to happen, but the end is still to come.
For nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. There will be earthquakes in various places, and there will be famines and turmoil.
But watch out for yourselves. They will hand you over to councils, and in their synagogues, you will be beaten; and you will stand before governors and kings for my sake, as a testimony to them.
And the gospel must first be proclaimed to all nations.
But when they bring you to trial and deliver you over, do not be anxious beforehand about what you are to say; but whatever is given to you in that hour, speak that. For it is not you who speak, but the Holy Spirit.
Brother will betray brother to death, and a father his child; and children will rise up against parents and have them put to death.
And you will be hated by all because of my name; but the one who endures to the end will be saved.
But when you see the abomination that causes desolation standing where it should not be—let the one who reads understand—then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains.
But the one who is on the rooftop must not go down to enter his house or take anything out of it.
And let the one who is in the field not turn back to take his garment.
But woe to those who are pregnant and to those who are nursing infants in those days!
Pray that your escape may not happen in winter.
For those days will be a time of suffering, such as has not been since the beginning of creation, which God created, until now; and never will be.
And if the Lord had not cut short those days, no flesh would be saved; but for the sake of the elect whom He chose, He has cut those days short.
And then, if anyone says to you, ‘Look, here is the Christ!’ or ‘Look, He is over there!’ do not believe it.
For false messiahs and false prophets will arise and perform signs and wonders to lead astray, if possible, the chosen ones.
But you take heed; behold, I have foretold you all things.
But in those days, after that tribulation, the sun will be darkened, and the moon will not give its light.
And the stars will be falling from the sky, and the powers that are in the heavens will be shaken.
And then they will see the Son of Man coming in the clouds, with great power and glory.
And then He will send out His angels, and they will gather His chosen ones from the four corners of the earth to the farthest reaches of heaven.
From the fig tree, learn this lesson: when its branch becomes tender and produces leaves, you know that summer is near.
In the same way, when you see these things happening, recognize that He is near, standing at the door.
Truly, I say to you, this generation will not pass away until all these things have occurred.
Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will not pass away.
But concerning that day or hour, no one knows, neither the angels in heaven nor the Son, but only the Father.
Be watchful, stay alert, and pray; for you do not know when the time will come.
It is like a man going on a journey, who leaves his house and gives authority to his servants, assigning to each his task, and commands the doorkeeper to stay alert.
Therefore, stay alert, for you do not know when the master of the house will come, whether in the evening, or at midnight, or when the rooster crows, or in the morning.
Do not let him come suddenly and find you sleeping.
And what I say to you, I say to all: Stay alert.
It was now two days before the Passover and the Feast of Unleavened Bread. The chief priests and the scribes were seeking how to secretly arrest Him and kill Him.
But they were saying, 'Not during the feast, lest there be an uproar among the people.'
And while He was in Bethany at the house of Simon the leper, as He sat at the table, a woman came having an alabaster flask of very costly spikenard. Then she broke the flask and poured it on His head.
And there were some who were greatly displeased among themselves, saying, "Why was this fragrant oil wasted?"
For this ointment could have been sold for more than three hundred denarii and given to the poor; and they scolded her harshly.
But Jesus said, "Leave her alone; why are you bothering her? She has performed a beautiful act of service for Me."
For you will always have the poor among you, and whenever you wish, you can do good for them; but you will not always have Me.
She has done what she could; she has anointed My body beforehand for burial.
Truly I tell you, wherever this gospel is proclaimed throughout the entire world, what she has done will be told in remembrance of her.
And Judas Iscariot, one of the Twelve, went away to the chief priests in order to betray him to them.
When they heard this, they rejoiced and promised to give him money. So he sought an opportunity to betray Him.
On the first day of the Feast of Unleavened Bread, when the Passover lamb was sacrificed, His disciples asked Him, "Where do You want us to go and prepare for You to eat the Passover?"
And He sent two of His disciples and said to them, 'Go into the city, and there you will meet a man carrying a pitcher of water; follow him.'
And wherever he enters, say to the owner of the house, 'The Teacher asks, Where is the place where I may eat the Passover with My disciples?'
And He will show you a large upper room, furnished and ready; there prepare for us.
So the disciples went out and came into the city, and they found it just as He had said to them, and they prepared the Passover.
And when evening had arrived, He came with the Twelve.
And as they reclined at the table and were eating, Jesus said, "Truly, I say to you, one of you will betray Me, one who eats with Me."
And they began to feel sorrowful and to say to Him, one by one, 'Is it I?' and another said, 'Is it I?'
He answered them, "It is one of the Twelve, the one who is dipping bread with Me in the dish."
The Son of Man indeed goes as it is written about Him; but woe to that man by whom the Son of Man is betrayed! It would have been better for that man if he had never been born.
And as they were eating, Jesus took bread, and after blessing it, He broke it and gave it to them, saying, "Take, eat; this is My body."
And taking the cup, after giving thanks, He gave it to them, and they all drank from it.
And He said to them, 'This is My blood of the new covenant, which is poured out for many.'
Truly, I say to you, I will no longer drink of the fruit of the vine until that day when I drink it new in the kingdom of God.
And when they had sung a hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives.
And Jesus said to them, "You will all be led to stumble because of me this night; for it is written, 'I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep will be scattered.'"
But after I have risen, I will go ahead of you into Galilee.
Peter said to Him, 'Even if all are led astray, I will not be!'
And Jesus said to him, "Truly, I say to you that today, this very night, before the rooster crows twice, you will deny me three times."
But Peter insisted even more, saying, "If I must die with You, I will never disown You." And all the others echoed the same sentiment.
They went to a place called Gethsemane, and Jesus said to his disciples, "Sit here while I pray."
And He took Peter, James, and John along with Him, and He began to be deeply troubled and distressed.
He said to them, "My soul is overwhelmed with grief to the point of death. Stay here and keep watch."
Going a little further, He fell to the ground and prayed that, if it were possible, the hour might pass from Him.
And He said, "Abba, Father, all things are possible for You; remove this cup from Me; yet not what I will, but what You will."
And He came and found them sleeping, and said to Peter, "Simon, are you asleep? Could you not stay awake for one hour?
Stay alert and pray, so that you do not fall into temptation. The spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak.
And going away again, He prayed the same words.
And returning, He found them again sleeping; for their eyes were weighed down, and they did not know what to answer Him.
He returned the third time and said to them, "Sleep on now and take your rest! It is enough; the hour has come; behold, the Son of Man is being delivered into the hands of sinners.
Rise, let us be going. Look, my betrayer is near.
And immediately, while he was still speaking, Judas Iscariot, one of the Twelve, arrived with a large crowd armed with swords and clubs, sent by the chief priests, the scribes, and the elders.
The one who was betraying him had given them a signal, saying, 'Whomever I kiss, he is the one; seize him and lead him away securely.'
And coming straight to him, he said, 'Greetings, Rabbi!' and kissed him fervently.
Then they laid hands on him and seized him.
But one of those standing nearby drew his sword and struck the servant of the high priest, cutting off his ear.
And Jesus answered and said to them, "Have you come out as against a thief, with swords and clubs to capture me?
Every day I was with you in the temple, teaching, and you did not seize me. But let the Scriptures be fulfilled.
And they all left him and fled.
And a certain young man followed him, wearing nothing but a linen cloth over his naked body; and the young men laid hold on him.
But he left the linen cloth behind and fled away naked.
And they led Jesus away to the high priest; and all the chief priests and the elders and the scribes gathered together with him.
And Peter followed him from a distance, right into the courtyard of the high priest; and he sat down with the servants, warming himself by the light.
The chief priests and the whole council were seeking testimony against Jesus to put Him to death, but they found none.
For many bore false witness against Him, but their testimonies did not agree.
And some stood up and bore false witness against Him, saying.
"For we heard him say, 'I will destroy this temple made with hands, and in three days I will build another not made with hands.'"
And even their testimony was not consistent.
And the high priest rose up in the midst and questioned Jesus, saying, "Will you not answer? What are these men testifying against you?"
But he remained silent and gave no answer. Again the high priest asked him, "Are you the Christ, the Son of the Blessed One?"
Jesus said, "I am. And you will see the Son of Man seated at the right hand of the Almighty and coming on the clouds of heaven."
Then the high priest tore his robes and said, "What further need do we have for witnesses?"
You have heard the blasphemy; what is your judgment? And they all condemned him to be guilty of death.
And some began to spit on Him, and to cover His face, and to strike Him, saying, "Prophesy to us, O Christ! Who is it that struck You?" And the officers struck Him with the palms of their hands.
And while Peter was below in the courtyard, one of the servant girls of the high priest came.
And seeing Peter warming himself, she looked at him and said, "You also were one of those with Jesus of Nazareth."
But he denied it, saying, "I do not know, nor do I understand what you are talking about." And he went out into the entryway, and a rooster crowed.
And the servant girl, seeing him again, began to say to those who stood by, "This man is one of them."
But he again denied it. And after a little while, those who stood nearby said to Peter, "Truly, you are one of them; for you are a Galilean, and your speech betrays you."
But he began to call down curses and to swear, "I do not know this man you are talking about!" And immediately, the rooster crowed a second time.
And Peter remembered the word that Jesus had spoken to him: 'Before the rooster crows twice, you will deny me three times.' And when he realized this, he broke down and wept.
And immediately in the morning, the chief priests, along with the elders, scribes, and the entire council, bound Jesus, led him away, and delivered him to Pilate.
And Pilate asked Him, 'Are You the King of the Jews?' Jesus replied, 'You say so.'
And the chief priests brought many accusations against Him, but He answered nothing.
Then Pilate again asked Him, saying, 'Are You not going to answer? Look at how many charges they are bringing against You!'
But Jesus made no further reply, so that Pilate was amazed.
Now at the festival, it was customary for him to release one prisoner to them, whoever they requested.
And there was a man named Barabbas, who was bound with the insurrectionists, having committed murder during the uprising.
And the crowd, raising their voices, began to request as they always did.
But Pilate answered them, saying, "Do you want me to release to you the King of the Jews?"
For he perceived that it was out of envy that the chief priests had handed him over.
But the chief priests stirred up the crowd to demand that he release Barabbas to them.
So Pilate answered again and said to them, "What then do you want me to do with Him whom you call the King of the Jews?"
But they shouted again, 'Crucify Him!'
But Pilate said to them, 'What wrong has He done?'; but they shouted all the louder, 'Crucify Him!'
So, Pilate, wishing to satisfy the crowd, released Barabbas to them, and after having Jesus scourged, he handed Him over to be crucified.
The soldiers led Him away into the courtyard, which is the governor's headquarters, and they called together the whole battalion.
And they dressed Him in a purple robe, and weaving together a crown of thorns, they placed it on Him.
And they began to salute Him, saying, 'Hail, King of the Jews!'
And they struck His head with a reed and spat on Him, and bending their knees, they worshiped Him.
And when they had mocked Him, they stripped Him of the purple robe and clothed Him in His own garments. Then they led Him out to crucify Him.
And they forced a certain man, Simon of Cyrene, coming from the countryside, the father of Alexander and Rufus, to carry His cross.
And they brought Him to the place called Golgotha, which is translated, 'Place of the Skull.'
And they offered Him wine mixed with myrrh; but He did not take it.
And when they had crucified Him, they divided His clothes among themselves, casting lots to determine what each should take.
It was the third hour when they crucified Him.
And the inscription of His charge was written above: THE KING OF THE JEWS.
And they crucified two robbers with Him, one on His right and one on His left.
And the scripture was fulfilled that says: ‘He was counted among the lawless.’
And those who passed by reviled Him, shaking their heads and saying, 'Ah, you who would destroy the temple and rebuild it in three days!'
Save Yourself, and come down from the cross!
In the same way, the chief priests, mocking one another with the scribes, said, "He saved others; He cannot save Himself."
Let the Christ, the King of Israel, descend now from the cross, so that we may see and believe in Him.” And those who were crucified with Him also heaped insults upon Him.
And when the sixth hour had come, darkness fell over the whole land until the ninth hour.
And at the ninth hour, Jesus cried out with a loud voice, saying, 'My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?'
And some of those who were standing nearby, when they heard it, said, 'Look, He is calling for Elijah!'
Then one of those standing nearby ran and filled a sponge with sour wine, put it on a stick, and offered it to Him, saying, 'Let us see if Elijah comes to take Him down.'
But Jesus, letting out a loud cry, breathed His last.
And the curtain of the temple was torn in two from the top down to the bottom.
And when the centurion who stood opposite him saw that he cried out and breathed his last, he said, "Truly, this man was the Son of God."
There were also women looking on from a distance, among whom were Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James the Less and of Joses, and Salome.
And there were women who had followed Him in Galilee, serving Him; and many other women had come up with Him to Jerusalem.
And now, when evening had come, since it was the day of preparation, which is the day before the Sabbath,
Joseph of Arimathea, an honorable member of the Council, who was also himself waiting for the kingdom of God, boldly went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus.
But Pilate was surprised to hear that he was already dead, and summoning the centurion, he asked him whether he had been dead for some time.
And having learned from the centurion, he granted the body to Joseph.
And having purchased a linen cloth, he took Him down and wrapped Him in the linen. He laid Him in a tomb that had been carved out of the rock, and rolled a stone against the entrance of the tomb.
And Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of Joses observed where He was laid.
And when the Sabbath was past, Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James, and Salome bought spices so that they might go and anoint Him.
And very early on the first day of the week, as the sun was rising, they came to the tomb.
And they said to one another, "Who will roll away the stone for us from the entrance of the tomb?"
And when they looked up, they saw that the stone had been rolled away; for it was exceedingly large.
And upon entering the tomb, they saw a young man sitting on the right side, clothed in a white robe, and they were greatly astonished.
But he said to them, "Do not be astonished; you seek Jesus of Nazareth, who was crucified. He has risen; He is not here. See the place where they laid Him.
But go, tell His disciples and Peter, 'He is going ahead of you to Galilee; there you will see Him, just as He told you.'
And they went out and fled from the tomb, for trembling and astonishment had seized them, and they said nothing to anyone, for they were afraid.
Now when Jesus rose early on the first day of the week, He appeared first to Mary Magdalene, from whom He had cast out seven demons.
She went and reported to those who had been with Him, who were mourning and weeping.
And when they heard that He was alive and had been seen by her, they did not believe.
Afterward, He appeared in a different form to two of them as they were walking to the country.
And they went and reported to the others; but they did not believe them.
Later, as they were reclining at the table, He appeared to the eleven and rebuked them for their unbelief and hardness of heart, because they had not believed those who had seen Him after He had risen.
And He said to them, "Go into all the world and proclaim the good news to all creation."
Whoever believes and is baptized will be saved, but whoever does not believe will be condemned.
And these signs will accompany those who believe: in my name they will cast out demons; they will speak in new tongues.
They will pick up serpents, and if they drink any deadly poison, it will not hurt them; they will lay their hands on the sick, and they will recover.
So then, the Lord Jesus, after speaking to them, was taken up into heaven and sat down at the right hand of God.
And they went out and preached everywhere, while the Lord worked with them and confirmed the message by accompanying signs. Amen.
Inasmuch as many have undertaken to compile a narrative of the events that have been fulfilled among us,
just as those who from the beginning were eyewitnesses and ministers of the word delivered them to us,
It seemed good to me, having closely followed all things from the beginning, to write to you in orderly fashion, most excellent Theophilus,
so that you may have certainty concerning the things you have been taught.
In the days when Herod was king of Judea, there was a certain priest named Zechariah, belonging to the division of Abijah; and his wife was from the daughters of Aaron, and her name was Elizabeth.
Both were righteous in the sight of God, walking blamelessly in all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord.
But they had no child, because Elizabeth was barren, and they were both advanced in age.
Now it happened that while he was serving as a priest before God in the order of his division,
according to the custom of the priesthood, he was chosen by lot to enter the temple of the Lord and burn incense.
And the whole multitude of the people was praying outside at the hour of incense.
And an angel of the Lord appeared to him, standing at the right side of the altar of incense.
And Zacharias was troubled when he saw the angel, and fear fell upon him.
But the angel said to him, 'Do not be afraid, Zacharias; for your prayer has been heard, and your wife Elizabeth will bear you a son, and you shall call his name John.'
And you will have joy and gladness, and many will rejoice at his birth.
For he will be great in the sight of the Lord; he will not drink wine or strong drink, and he will be filled with the Holy Spirit even from his mother’s womb.
And he will turn many of the children of Israel back to the Lord their God.
And he will go before Him in the spirit and power of Elijah, to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children and the disobedient to the wisdom of the just, to make ready a people prepared for the Lord.
And Zechariah said to the angel, "How shall I know this? For I am an old man, and my wife is advanced in years."
And the angel answered him, 'I am Gabriel, who stands in the presence of God, and I was sent to speak to you and to bring you this good news.'
And behold, you will be silent and unable to speak until the day these things take place, because you did not believe my words, which will be fulfilled in their time.
Meanwhile, the people were waiting for Zechariah, and they marveled that he stayed so long in the temple.
Upon exiting, he was unable to speak to them, and they understood that he had seen a vision in the temple; he remained mute, gesturing to them.
And it came to pass that when the days of his ministry were fulfilled, he departed to his own house.
After those days, his wife Elizabeth conceived, and she kept herself hidden for five months.
She said, 'Thus the Lord has done for me in the days when He looked upon me to take away my reproach among people.'
In the sixth month, the angel Gabriel was sent from God to a city of Galilee named Nazareth,
to a virgin pledged to be married to a man named Joseph, of the house of David; and the virgin’s name was Mary.
And the angel entered to her and said, 'Rejoice, favored one! The Lord is with you; blessed are you among women.'
But she was greatly troubled at his word, and wondered what kind of greeting this might be.
And the angel said to her, 'Do not be afraid, Mary, for you have found favor with God.'
And behold, you will conceive in your womb and bear a son, and you shall call his name Jesus.
He will be great, and he will be called the Son of the Most High; and the Lord God will give him the throne of his father David.
And he will reign over the house of Jacob forever, and of his kingdom there will be no end.
And Mary said to the angel, "How will this happen, since I am a virgin?"
And the angel answered her, 'The Holy Spirit will come upon you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you; therefore, the one to be born will be called holy, the Son of God.'
And behold, your relative Elizabeth has also conceived a son in her old age, and this is the sixth month for her who was called barren.
For nothing will be impossible with God.
Then Mary said, 'Behold, I am the servant of the Lord; let it be to me according to your word.' And the angel departed from her.
In those days, Mary arose and went with haste to the hill country, to a city of Judah.
And she entered the house of Zacharias and greeted Elizabeth.
And when Elizabeth heard the greeting of Mary, the baby leaped in her womb; and Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit.
And she cried out with a loud voice and said, "Blessed are you among women, and blessed is the fruit of your womb!"
But why am I so favored, that the mother of my Lord should come to me?
For behold, as soon as the sound of your greeting reached my ears, the baby leaped in joy within my womb.
And blessed is she who has believed that what the Lord has spoken to her will be fulfilled.
And Mary said, "My soul magnifies the Lord.
and my spirit exults in God my Savior,
For He has looked with favor upon the humble state of His servant. Behold, from now on, all generations will call me blessed.
For the Mighty One has done great things for me, and holy is His name.
And His mercy is for generations upon generations for those who revere Him.
He has displayed His might with His arm; He has scattered those who are proud in the thoughts of their hearts.
He has toppled the powerful from their thrones and has raised up the humble.
He has filled the hungry with good things, but the rich He has sent away empty.
He has taken hold of His servant Israel, to remember His mercy.
just as He spoke to our ancestors, to Abraham and his descendants forever.
And Mary stayed with her about three months, and returned to her home.
Now the time came for Elizabeth to give birth, and she bore a son.
And the neighbors and relatives heard that the Lord had shown great mercy to her, and they rejoiced with her.
And it came to pass on the eighth day that they came to circumcise the child, and they called him by the name of his father, Zechariah.
And his mother answered, saying, "No, he shall be called John."
And they said to her, 'There is no one among your relatives who is called by this name.'
They made signs to his father, asking what he would have him called.
And he asked for a writing tablet and wrote, saying, 'His name is John.' And they all marveled.
And immediately his mouth was opened, and his tongue was loosed, and he spoke, blessing God.
And there came fear upon all who lived around them, and throughout all the hilly region of Judea, these matters were spoken of extensively.
And all who heard these things pondered in their hearts, saying, 'What then will this child be?' For the hand of the Lord was with him.
And his father Zechariah was filled with the Holy Spirit and prophesied, saying,
Blessed be the Lord God of Israel, for He has visited and brought redemption to His people.
And He has raised up a mighty horn of salvation for us in the house of His servant David.
just as He spoke by the mouth of His holy prophets, who have been since the world began.
salvation from our enemies, and from the hand of all who hate us,
to show mercy to our fathers, and to remember His holy covenant.
the oath He swore to our forefather Abraham, to grant us.
to grant us, that we, being delivered from the hand of our enemies, might serve Him without fear.
in holiness and righteousness before Him all the days of our life.
And you, child, will be called the prophet of the Most High; for you will go before the Lord to prepare His ways.
to give knowledge of salvation to His people by the forgiveness of their sins.
Because of the tender mercy of our God, with which the rising sun will visit us from on high,
to shine upon those who sit in darkness and in the shadow of death, to guide our feet into the way of peace.
And the child grew and became strong in spirit, and he was in the wilderness until the day of his manifestation to Israel.
In those days, a decree went out from Caesar Augustus that all the inhabited earth should be registered.
This was the first registration that took place while Quirinius was governing Syria.
And all were going to be registered, each to his own city.
And Joseph also went up from Galilee, out of the city of Nazareth, to Judea, to the city of David, which is called Bethlehem, because he was of the house and lineage of David.
to register along with Mary, his betrothed wife, who was with child.
And while they were there, the days were completed for her to give birth.
And she gave birth to her firstborn son, and wrapped him in swaddling cloths, and laid him in a manger, because there was no room for them in the inn.
And there were shepherds in the same region, staying out in the fields and keeping watch over their flock by night.
And behold, an angel of the Lord stood before them, and the glory of the Lord shone around them, and they were greatly afraid.
But the angel said to them, 'Do not be afraid; for behold, I bring you good news of great joy that will be for all the people.'
For today in the city of David, a Savior has been born for you, who is Christ the Lord.
And this will be the sign for you: You will find a newborn baby wrapped in swaddling clothes and lying in a manger.
And suddenly, there appeared with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host praising God and saying,
Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace among those with whom he is pleased.
And it came to pass, when the angels had departed from them into heaven, the shepherds said to one another, "Let us go now to Bethlehem and see this thing that has been made known to us by the Lord."
And they hurriedly went and found Mary and Joseph, and the baby lying in the manger.
And when they saw it, they made known the saying that had been told to them concerning this child.
And all who heard it were amazed at what the shepherds told them.
But Mary treasured up all these words, pondering them in her heart.
And the shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all the things they had heard and seen, which were just as they had been told.
And when the eight days were fulfilled for the circumcising of the child, his name was called Jesus, which was given by the angel before he was conceived in the womb.
And when the days of their purification according to the law of Moses were completed, they brought him up to Jerusalem to present him to the Lord.
as it is written in the Law of the Lord, ‘Every male that opens the womb shall be called holy to the Lord.’
and to offer a sacrifice in accordance with what is said in the Law of the Lord: 'a pair of turtledoves or two young pigeons.'
And behold, there was a man in Jerusalem, whose name was Simeon, and this man was righteous and devout, awaiting the consolation of Israel; and the Holy Spirit was upon him.
And it had been revealed to him by the Holy Spirit that he would not see death before he had seen the Lord's Christ.
And he came into the temple in the Spirit; and when the parents brought in the child Jesus to do for him according to the custom of the Law,
He took Him up in his arms, blessed God, and said,
Now, Sovereign Lord, you can dismiss your servant in peace, just as you have promised.
For my eyes have seen your salvation,
which You have prepared in the presence of all nations,
a light for revelation to the Gentiles, and the glory of Your people Israel.
And Joseph and His mother were astonished at the things being said about Him.
And Simeon blessed them and said to Mary, His mother, 'Behold, this child is destined for the fall and the rising of many in Israel, and for a sign that will be opposed.'
And a sword will pierce your own soul, so that the thoughts of many hearts may be revealed.
And there was a prophetess, Anna, the daughter of Phanuel, of the tribe of Asher; she was advanced in years, having lived with a husband for seven years from her virginity,
and this woman was a widow of eighty-four years, who did not depart from the temple, serving God with fastings and prayers, night and day.
And at that very moment, she came up and began to give thanks to the Lord and spoke about Him to all who were waiting for the redemption of Jerusalem.
And when they had completed everything in accordance with the Law of the Lord, they returned to Galilee, to their own city of Nazareth.
And the child grew and became strong in spirit, filled with wisdom, and the grace of God was upon him.
Now his parents went to Jerusalem every year for the feast of Passover.
And when he was twelve years old, they went up to Jerusalem according to the custom of the feast.
And when they had completed the days of the feast, as they were returning, Jesus, the child, remained behind in Jerusalem, and Joseph and his mother did not know it.
But thinking that he was in their company, they traveled for a day’s journey; then they began to search for him among their relatives and acquaintances.
And not finding him, they returned to Jerusalem, searching for him.
After three days, they found him in the temple, sitting among the teachers, listening to them and asking them questions.
And all who heard him were astonished at his understanding and his answers.
And when they saw him, they were amazed, and his mother said to him, 'Child, why have you treated us like this? Behold, your father and I have been searching for you in great distress.'
And He said to them, 'Why were you searching for Me? Did you not know that I must be in my Father's house?'
And they did not comprehend the statement He had made to them.
And He went down with them and came to Nazareth, and was obedient to them. And His mother kept all these sayings in her heart.
And Jesus increased in wisdom and stature, and in favor with God and man.
In the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar, when Pontius Pilate was governor of Judea, and Herod was tetrarch of Galilee, his brother Philip was tetrarch of the region of Ituraea and Trachonitis, and Lysanias was tetrarch of Abilene,
during the high priesthood of Annas and Caiaphas, the word of God came to John the son of Zacharias in the wilderness.
And he went throughout all the region around the Jordan, proclaiming a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins.
As it is written in the book of the words of the prophet Isaiah, saying: 'A voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare the way of the Lord, make His paths straight;'
Every valley shall be filled, and every mountain and hill shall be made low; the crooked places shall be made straight, and the rough ways smooth.
And all humanity will see the salvation of God.
Therefore he said to the crowds coming out to be baptized by him, "You offspring of vipers, who warned you to flee from the coming wrath?"
Therefore, produce fruits that are worthy of repentance, and do not begin to say to yourselves, ‘We have Abraham as our father.’ For I tell you that God is able to raise up children to Abraham from these stones.
Already the axe is laid to the root of the trees; therefore, every tree that does not produce good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.
And the crowds were asking him, "What then should we do?"
He answered them, saying, 'Whoever has two coats must share with the one who has none, and whoever has food must do likewise.'
Tax collectors also came to be baptized, and they asked him, 'Teacher, what should we do?'
But he said to them, 'Collect no more than you are authorized to collect.'
And the soldiers also asked him, 'And what shall we do?' He said to them, 'Do not intimidate anyone or accuse falsely, and be content with your wages.'
As the people were in expectation and all were reasoning in their hearts about John, whether he might be the Christ,
John answered them all, saying, 'I indeed baptize you with water; but there comes one who is mightier than I, whose sandals I am not worthy to untie. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and with fire.'
He has his winnowing fork in his hand, and He will thoroughly clean out His threshing floor; He will gather the wheat into His barn, but the chaff He will burn with unquenchable fire.
So with many other words of encouragement, he announced the good news to the people.
But Herod the tetrarch, being rebuked by him concerning Herodias, his brother’s wife, and for all the evil things that Herod had done,
Herod added this to all his other evils: he imprisoned John.
Now it happened that when all the people were baptized, and Jesus also had been baptized and was praying, the heavens were opened.
And the Holy Spirit descended upon him in bodily form like a dove, and a voice came from heaven saying, 'You are my beloved Son; in you I am well pleased.'
Now Jesus, when he began his ministry, was about thirty years old, being considered the son of Joseph, the son of Heli.
the son of Matthan, the son of Levi, the son of Melchi, the son of John, the son of Joseph,
the son of Mattathias, the son of Amos, the son of Nahum, the son of Esli, the son of Naggai,
the son of Maath, the son of Mattathias, the son of Semein, the son of Joseph, the son of Jodah,
the son of John, the son of Rhesa, the son of Zerubbabel, the son of Shealtiel, the son of Neri,
the son of Melchi, the son of Addi, the son of Cosam, the son of Elmadan, the son of Ir,
the son of Joseph, the son of Eleazar, the son of Jorim, the son of Mattath, the son of Levi.
the son of Simeon, the son of Judah, the son of Joseph, the son of Jonah, the son of Eliakim.
the son of Melea, the son of Mainan, the son of Mattatha, the son of Nathan, the son of David,
the son of Jesse, the son of Obed, the son of Boaz, the son of Salmon, the son of Nahshon,
the son of Amminadab, the son of Ram, the son of Hezron, the son of Perez, the son of Judah,
the son of Jacob, the son of Isaac, the son of Abraham, the son of Terah, the son of Nahor.
the son of Serug, the son of Reu, the son of Peleg, the son of Eber, the son of Salah.
the son of Cainan, the son of Arphaxad, the son of Shem, the son of Noah, the son of Lamech,
the son of Methuselah, the son of Enoch, the son of Jared, the son of Mahalalel, the son of Cainan,
the son of Enos, the son of Seth, the son of Adam, the son of God.
Then Jesus, filled with the Holy Spirit, returned from the Jordan and was led by the Spirit into the wilderness.
He was tempted by the devil for forty days. He ate nothing during those days, and when they were ended, he was hungry.
And the devil said to Him, "If You are the Son of God, command this stone to become bread."
And Jesus answered him, saying, "It is written, ‘Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that comes forth from the mouth of God.’"
Then the devil took Him up to a high mountain and showed Him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time.
And the devil said to Him, "I will give you all this authority and the glory of these kingdoms, for it has been handed over to me, and I can give it to whomever I wish."
Therefore, if you will bow down and worship before me, it will all be yours.
And Jesus answered him, "Get behind me, Satan; for it is written, 'You shall worship the Lord your God, and Him alone shall you serve.'"
And he brought him to Jerusalem, set him on the pinnacle of the temple, and said to him, 'If you are the Son of God, throw yourself down from here;'
For it is written, ‘He shall command His angels concerning you, to guard you,’
and, 'They will lift you up in their hands, so that you will not strike your foot against a stone.'
And Jesus answered him, saying, "It is said, 'You shall not put the Lord your God to the test.'"
And when the devil had completed every temptation, he departed from Him until an opportune time.
And Jesus returned to Galilee in the power of the Spirit, and news about Him spread throughout all the surrounding region.
And He was teaching in their synagogues, being praised by everyone.
And He came to Nazareth, where He had been raised, and as was His custom, He entered the synagogue on the Sabbath day, and He stood up to read.
And the scroll of the prophet Isaiah was handed to Him, and He unrolled the scroll and found the place where it was written:
The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because He has anointed me to proclaim good news to the poor. He has sent me to heal the brokenhearted,
to proclaim the year of the Lord's favor.
And when he had rolled up the scroll and returned it to the attendant, he sat down; and the eyes of all in the synagogue were fixed on him.
And he began to say to them, "Today this scripture is fulfilled in your hearing."
And all spoke well of Him and marveled at the words of grace that came from His mouth; and they said, 'Isn't this Joseph's son?'
He said to them, 'Surely you will quote this proverb to me: 'Physician, heal yourself!' Whatever we heard was done in Capernaum, do here in your hometown as well.'
But he said, 'Truly I tell you, no prophet is accepted in his own hometown.'
But truly, I say to you, there were many widows in Israel in the days of Elijah, when the sky was shut up for three years and six months, and a great famine came over all the land.
And Elijah was sent to none of them but only to a widow in Zarephath of Sidon.
And there were many lepers in Israel during the time of Elisha the prophet, yet none of them were cleansed except Naaman the Syrian.
And all in the synagogue were filled with rage when they heard these things.
And rising up, they drove him out of the city and brought him to the edge of the hill on which their city was built, intending to throw him down the cliff.
But he passed through the midst of them and went on his way.
And he came down to Capernaum, a city of Galilee, and was teaching them on the Sabbaths.
And they were amazed at His teaching, for His word possessed authority.
And in the synagogue, there was a man possessed by an unclean spirit, and he cried out with a loud voice.
‘Leave us alone! What do you want with us, Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are—the Holy One of God!’
But Jesus rebuked him, saying, 'Be silent and come out of him!' Then the demon threw the man down in the midst of the crowd and came out of him without harming him.
And amazement came upon all, and they spoke to one another, saying, 'What is this word? For with authority and power He commands the unclean spirits, and they come out!'
And the report about Him went out into every place of the surrounding region.
After leaving the synagogue, He entered Simon's house. Now Simon's mother-in-law was suffering from a severe fever, and they asked Him about her.
And standing over her, He rebuked the fever, and it left her. Immediately, she rose up and began to serve them.
As the sun was setting, all who had any sick with various diseases brought them to Him. And He laid His hands on each one of them and healed them.
And demons came out of many, crying out and saying, "You are the Christ, the Son of God." But He rebuked them and did not allow them to speak, because they knew that He was the Christ.
And when day broke, He went out and departed to a lonely place. And the crowds sought Him, and came to Him and tried to keep Him from leaving them.
But He said to them, 'I must proclaim the good news of the kingdom of God to the other towns as well; for that is why I was sent.'
And He was proclaiming the message in the synagogues of Galilee.
And it came to pass, as the crowd pressed around Him to hear the word of God, that He stood by the Lake of Gennesaret.
And He saw two boats standing by the lake, but the fishermen had gone out of them and were washing their nets.
Getting into one of the boats, which belonged to Simon, He asked him to put out a little from the land. And sitting down, He taught the people from the boat.
When He had finished speaking, He said to Simon, "Put out into the deep water and let down your nets for a catch."
And Simon answered Him, "Master, we toiled all night and caught nothing; but at Your word, I will let down the net."
And when they had done this, they enclosed a great multitude of fish; and their net was breaking.
And they signaled to their partners in the other boat to come and help them. And they came and filled both boats so that they began to sink.
When Simon Peter saw this, he fell at Jesus' knees and said, 'Go away from me, Lord, for I am a sinful man.'
For astonishment had seized him and all those with him, because of the catch of fish they had taken.
And likewise, James and John, the sons of Zebedee, who were partners with Simon. And Jesus said to Simon, 'Do not be afraid; from now on you will be catching people.'
And when they had brought their boats to land, they left everything and followed him.
While he was in one of the cities, there came a man full of leprosy; and when he saw Jesus, he fell on his face and begged him, saying, "Lord, if you are willing, you can make me clean."
And extending His hand, He touched him, saying, 'I am willing; be clean.' And immediately the leprosy left him.
And He commanded him to tell no one, but go and show yourself to the priest, and offer for your cleansing the things which Moses commanded, as a testimony to them.
Yet the news about Him continued to spread all the more, and large crowds gathered to hear Him and to be healed of their infirmities.
But Jesus often withdrew to the wilderness and prayed.
And it came to pass on one of those days, as He was teaching, that there were Pharisees and teachers of the law sitting nearby, who had come from every village of Galilee and Judea and from Jerusalem. And the power of the Lord was present to heal them.
And behold, men were bringing on a bed a man who was paralyzed, and they sought to bring him in and lay him before Him.
But when they could not find a way to bring him in because of the crowd, they went up on the roof and let him down with his bed through the tiles into the midst before Jesus.
And when Jesus saw their faith, he said to the man, "Friend, your sins are forgiven."
And the scribes and Pharisees began to reason, saying, "Who is this who speaks blasphemies? Who can forgive sins but God alone?"
But Jesus, perceiving their thoughts, answered them, saying, "Why do you entertain thoughts in your hearts?
Which is easier to say: 'Your sins are forgiven,' or to say, 'Get up and walk'?
But so that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins—He said to the paralytic, 'I say to you, arise, and take up your bed and go to your house.'
And at once he rose up before them, took up the mat on which he had been lying, and went home praising God.
And all were astonished, and they glorified God, filled with fear, saying, 'We have seen extraordinary things today.'
After this, He went out and saw a tax collector named Levi sitting at the tax booth, and He said to him, 'Follow Me.'
And leaving everything behind, he rose up and followed Him.
And Levi made a great feast for Him in his house, and there was a large crowd of tax collectors and others reclining at the table with them.
And the scribes and Pharisees grumbled against His disciples, saying, "Why do you eat and drink with tax collectors and sinners?"
And Jesus answered them, saying, "It is not the healthy who need a doctor, but those who are unwell."
I have not come to call the righteous, but rather sinners to repentance.
But they said to Him, 'Why do the disciples of John fast often and make prayers, and likewise those of the Pharisees, but Yours eat and drink?'
But He said to them, "Can you make the friends of the bridegroom fast while the bridegroom is with them?"
But the days will come when the bridegroom is taken away from them; then they will fast in those days.
He also told them a parable: No one tears a piece from a new garment and puts it on an old one. If he does, he will tear the new garment, and the piece from the new will not match the old.
And no one puts new wine into old wineskins; if he does, the new wine will burst the old skins, and the wine will be spilled, and the skins will be destroyed.
But new wine must be put into new wineskins; otherwise, both will be ruined.
And no one who drinks old wine immediately desires new; for he says, 'The old is better.'
Now it happened on the second Sabbath after the first that He was going through the grain fields, and His disciples plucked the heads of grain and ate, rubbing them in their hands.
But some of the Pharisees said to them, "Why are you doing what is not lawful to do on the Sabbath?"
And Jesus answered them, 'Have you not read what David did when he was hungry, he and those who were with him?'
How he entered the house of God and took the sacred bread, eating it and giving some to those who were with him, which is not lawful for anyone to eat except for the priests alone?
And He said to them, 'The Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath.'
Now it happened on another Sabbath, that He entered the synagogue and taught; and there was a man there whose right hand was withered.
And the scribes and the Pharisees were closely watching Him, whether He would heal on the Sabbath, so that they might find an accusation against Him.
But He knew their thoughts and said to the man with the withered hand, "Rise and stand in the midst." And he rose and stood.
So Jesus said to them, "I will ask you a question: Is it lawful on the Sabbath to do good or to do harm, to save a life or to destroy it?"
And after looking around at them all, He said to the man, "Extend your hand." And he did so, and his hand was restored to its original state.
But they were filled with madness, and they began to discuss with one another what they might do to Jesus.
In those days, he went out to the mountain to pray, and he spent the whole night in prayer to God.
And when the day came, He called His disciples to Himself and chose twelve of them, whom He also named apostles.
Simon, whom He also named Peter, and his brother Andrew; James and John; Philip and Bartholomew.
Matthew and Thomas, James the son of Alphaeus, and Simon called the Zealot.
Judas, the son of James, and Judas Iscariot, who became a traitor.
And after descending with them, He stood on a level place, and a multitude of His disciples, and a great crowd from all Judea and Jerusalem and the coastal region of Tyre and Sidon came to hear Him and to be healed of their diseases.
And those who were troubled by unclean spirits came to Him, and they were healed.
And all the crowd sought to touch him, for power was coming out from him and healing all.
And he lifted up his eyes to his disciples and said: "Blessed are you who are poor, for yours is the kingdom of God."
Blessed are you who are now hungry, for you shall be filled. Blessed are you who weep now, for you shall laugh.
Blessed are you when people hate you, and when they exclude you and insult you, and reject your name as evil because of the Son of Man.
Rejoice in that day and leap for joy, for behold, your reward is great in heaven; for in the same way their ancestors treated the prophets.
But woe to you who are rich, for you have received your consolation.
Woe to you who are full now, for you shall be hungry. Woe to you who laugh now, for you shall mourn and weep.
Woe to you when all people speak well of you, for so their ancestors treated the false prophets.
But to you who are listening, I say: Love your enemies, and do good to those who hate you.
Bless those who speak ill of you; pray for those who mistreat you.
To the one who strikes you on the cheek, offer the other also; and from the one who takes away your cloak, do not withhold your tunic.
Give to everyone who asks of you, and from the one who takes away your possessions, do not demand them back.
And as you wish that others would do to you, do so to them likewise.
And if you love those who love you, what credit is that to you? For even sinners love those who love them.
And if you do good to those who do good to you, what merit is there for you? For even sinners do the same.
And if you lend to those from whom you hope to receive back, what credit is that to you? For even sinners lend to sinners, expecting to be repaid in full.
But love your enemies, and do good, and lend expecting nothing in return; and your reward will be great, and you will be sons of the Most High, for he is kind to the ungrateful and the wicked.
Be merciful, just as your Father is merciful.
Do not judge, and you will not be judged; do not condemn, and you will not be condemned; forgive, and you will be forgiven.
Give, and it will be given to you; a good measure, pressed down, shaken together, and overflowing, will be poured into your lap. For with the measure you use, it will be measured back to you.
He also told them a parable: "Can a blind man guide a blind man? Will they not both fall into a pit?"
A disciple is not above his teacher; but everyone who is fully trained will be like his teacher.
Why do you see the speck that is in your brother's eye, but do not perceive the beam that is in your own eye?
Or how can you say to your brother, ‘Brother, let me remove the speck that is in your eye,’ when you do not see the beam that is in your own eye? Hypocrite! First, remove the beam from your own eye, and then you will see clearly to remove the speck that is in your brother’s eye.
For a good tree does not produce rotten fruit, nor does a rotten tree produce good fruit.
For each tree is recognized by its own fruit. People do not gather figs from thornbushes, nor do they pick grapes from brambles.
A good person brings good things out of the good stored up in their heart, and an evil person brings evil things out of the evil stored up in their heart. For the mouth speaks what the heart is full of.
Why do you call me ‘Lord, Lord,’ and do not do what I say?
Everyone who comes to me and hears my words and acts on them, I will show you what he is like:
He is like a man building a house, who dug down deep and laid the foundation on rock. When a flood came, the torrent struck that house but could not shake it, because it was well built on the rock.
But the one who hears and does not act is like a man who built a house on the ground without a foundation; when the river struck, it collapsed at once, and the ruin of that house was great.
After He had finished all His words in the hearing of the people, He entered Capernaum.
A centurion had a servant who was highly regarded and was sick to the point of death.
Upon hearing about Jesus, the centurion sent some Jewish elders to Him, requesting that He come and heal his servant.
And they came to Jesus, earnestly pleading with Him, saying, 'He is deserving for you to do this for him.'
For he loves our nation and has built us a synagogue.
And Jesus went with them. When he was not far from the house, the centurion sent friends to say to him, 'Lord, do not trouble yourself, for I am not worthy to have you come under my roof.'
Therefore, I did not consider myself worthy to come to you; but just say the word, and my servant will be healed.
For I, too, am a man set under authority, with soldiers under my command. I say to one, ‘Go,’ and he goes; to another, ‘Come,’ and he comes; and to my servant, ‘Do this,’ and he does it.
When Jesus heard these things, he was amazed at him, and turning to the crowd that followed him, he said, 'I tell you, I have not found such great faith even in Israel.'
When the messengers returned to the house, they found the servant well.
And it happened soon afterward that He went to a city called Nain; and His disciples were with Him, a great multitude following.
As He approached the city gate, a dead man was being carried out, the only son of his mother, and she was a widow. A considerable crowd from the city was with her.
When the Lord saw her, He felt deep compassion for her and said to her, "Do not weep."
And approaching the bier, He touched it, and the bearers stood still. He said, "Young man, I say to you, arise!"
And the dead man sat up and began to speak, and Jesus gave him back to his mother.
Fear seized all of them, and they glorified God, saying, "A great prophet has arisen among us," and "God has visited His people."
And this report about Him went out through all of Judea and the surrounding region.
And the disciples of John informed him about all these things.
And John, calling two of his disciples to him, sent them to the Lord, asking, 'Are you the Coming One, or should we look for another?'
When the men had come to Him, they said, 'John the Baptist has sent us to you, saying, “Are you the One who is to come, or should we expect someone else?”'
In that very hour, He healed many from diseases, afflictions, and evil spirits; and He granted sight to many who were blind.
And Jesus answered them, "Go and tell John what you have seen and heard: the blind receive their sight, the lame walk, lepers are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead are raised up, and the poor have the good news preached to them."
And blessed is he who does not take offense at me.
When the messengers of John had left, Jesus began to speak to the crowds about John: "What did you go out into the wilderness to see? A reed swaying in the wind?
But what did you go out to see? A man dressed in fine clothing? Behold, those who wear splendid attire and live in luxury are found in palaces.
But what did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes, I say to you, and even more than a prophet.
This is the one about whom it is written, 'Behold, I send my messenger before your face, who will prepare your way before you.'
For I say to you, among those born of women, no prophet is greater than John the Baptist; yet the least in the kingdom of God is greater than he.
And all the people, including the tax collectors, acknowledged God's justice by being baptized with the baptism of John.
But the Pharisees and the experts in the law rejected God's purpose for themselves, not having been baptized by him.
To what then shall I liken the people of this generation, and to what are they like?
They are like children sitting in the marketplace, calling to one another and saying, 'We played the flute for you, and you did not dance; we sang a dirge, and you did not weep.'
For John the Baptist has come, eating no bread and drinking no wine, and you say, 'He has a demon.'
The Son of Man has come eating and drinking, and you say, 'Look, a glutton and a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and sinners.'
Yet wisdom is justified by all her children.
One of the Pharisees asked Him to eat with him. And when He went into the Pharisee's house, He reclined at the table.
And behold, a woman in the city, who was known to be a sinner, upon learning that He was reclining at the table in the Pharisee's house, brought an alabaster flask of fragrant oil.
And standing behind Him at His feet, weeping, she began to wet His feet with her tears and wiped them with the hair of her head; and she kissed His feet and anointed them with the fragrant oil.
Now when the Pharisee who had invited Him saw this, he spoke to himself, saying, "If this Man were a prophet, He would know who and what kind of woman is touching Him, for she is a sinner."
And Jesus answered him, saying, "Simon, I have something to tell you." And he replied, "Teacher, say it."
There were two debtors to a certain moneylender; one owed five hundred denarii, and the other fifty.
But when they had nothing to repay, he freely forgave both. Now, tell me, which of them will love him more?
Simon answered and said, 'I suppose the one to whom he forgave the greater debt.' And Jesus said to him, 'You have judged rightly.'
Turning to the woman, He said to Simon, 'Do you see this woman? I entered your house, and you did not give Me any water for My feet, but she has wet My feet with her tears and wiped them with her hair.'
You did not give Me a kiss, but this woman has not stopped kissing My feet since the moment I came in.
You did not anoint My head with oil, but this woman has anointed My feet with perfume.
Therefore, I say to you, her many sins are forgiven, for she has shown great love. But he who is forgiven little loves little.
And He said to her, "Your sins are forgiven."
And those who reclined at the table began to say among themselves, "Who is this that even forgives sins?"
Then He said to the woman, 'Your faith has saved you; go in peace.'
Soon afterward, He went through cities and villages, proclaiming and announcing the good news of the kingdom of God; and the twelve were with Him.
And certain women who had been healed of evil spirits and diseases were with Him, among whom was Mary called Magdalene, from whom seven demons had gone out.
and Joanna, the wife of Chuza, Herod's steward, and Susanna, and many others who were ministering to Him from their substance.
And when a great multitude had gathered, and people were coming to Him from every city, He spoke to them by a parable.
A sower went out to sow his seed. As he sowed, some fell along the path; it was trampled down, and the birds of the air devoured it.
And other seed fell on the rocky ground; as it grew, it withered away because it had no moisture.
And another seed fell among the thorns, and as the thorns grew up with it, they choked it out.
And another seed fell on the good soil; and growing, it produced a hundredfold. As He said these things, He cried out, "Whoever has ears to hear, let him hear!"
And His disciples asked Him, saying, "What does this parable mean?"
He said, "To you it has been granted to know the mysteries of the kingdom of God, but to the others it is given in parables, so that seeing they may not see, and hearing they may not understand."
Now this is the parable: The seed is the word of God.
But those along the path are the ones who hear; then the devil comes and takes away the word from their hearts, so that they may not believe and be saved.
But those on the rock are those who, when they hear the word, receive it with joy; yet they have no root, who believe for a while but in the time of testing fall away.
And what fell among thorns, these are the ones who hear, but as they go on their way, they are choked by the cares, riches, and pleasures of life, and their fruit does not mature.
But the ones that fell on the good soil, these are the ones who, having heard the word with a noble and good heart, hold it fast and bear fruit with patience.
No one, after lighting a lamp, covers it with a container or puts it under a bed; instead, he puts it on a lampstand so that those who enter may see the light.
For nothing is concealed that will not be made evident, nor is anything hidden that will not come to light.
Take care then how you listen; for to the one who has, more will be given, but from the one who does not have, even what he thinks he has will be taken away.
Then his mother and his brothers came to him, but they were unable to reach him because of the crowd.
And it was reported to him, saying, "Your mother and your brothers are standing outside, desiring to see you."
But he answered them, "My mother and my brothers are those who hear the word of God and put it into practice."
One day, Jesus said to his disciples, "Let us cross over to the other side of the lake." So they got into the boat and set out.
But while they were sailing, He fell asleep. And a fierce windstorm swept down on the lake, and they were being swamped and were in great danger.
And they came to Him and awoke Him, saying, "Master, Master, we are perishing!" And He arose and rebuked the wind and the raging water, and they ceased, and there was a calm.
He said to them, "Where is your faith?" They were afraid and amazed, and they said to one another, "Who then is this, that he commands even the winds and the water, and they obey him?"
And they sailed to the region of the Gadarenes, which is across from Galilee.
And as He stepped onto the land, a man from the city met Him who was possessed by demons for a long time. He wore no clothes and did not live in a house, but among the tombs.
When he saw Jesus, he cried out and fell down before Him, shouting with a loud voice, "What do I have to do with You, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? I beg You, do not torment me!"
For He commanded the unclean spirit to come out of the man. For it had seized him many times; he was kept under guard with chains and shackles, but he would break the bonds and be driven by the demon into deserted places.
Jesus asked him, "What is your name?" He replied, "Legion," because many demons had entered into him.
And they begged Him not to command them to depart into the Abyss.
Now there was a large herd of pigs feeding on the hillside. And they begged Him to let them go into them; and He gave them permission.
Then the demons came out from the man and entered the pigs; and the herd rushed down the steep bank into the lake and was drowned.
When the herdsmen saw what had happened, they fled and reported it in the city and in the countryside.
So they went out to see what had happened, and they came to Jesus and found the man from whom the demons had gone out, sitting at Jesus' feet, clothed and in his right mind; and they were afraid.
And those who had seen it reported to them how the man who had been possessed by demons was saved.
And all the people of the surrounding region of the Gadarenes asked Him to depart from them, for they were seized with great fear. So He got into the boat and returned.
The man from whom the demons had gone out begged to stay with Him, but Jesus sent him away, saying,
Return to your home, and declare all that God has done for you.' So he went away, proclaiming throughout the whole city what Jesus had done for him.
Now when Jesus returned, the crowd welcomed him, for they were all eagerly waiting for him.
And behold, a man named Jairus came, who was the ruler of the synagogue; and falling at Jesus' feet, he begged Him to come to his house.
for he had an only daughter, about twelve years old, and she was dying. As he went, the crowds were pressing in on him.
And there was a woman who had been suffering from a flow of blood for twelve years, and though she had spent all her livelihood on doctors, she could not be healed by any.
She approached from behind and touched the fringe of his garment, and immediately her bleeding stopped.
And Jesus said, "Who touched me?" When they all denied it, Peter and those with him said, "Master, the crowds surround you and press in on you, and yet you ask, 'Who touched me?'"
But Jesus said, 'Someone touched me; I know that power has gone out from me.'
When the woman saw that she could not remain hidden, she came trembling and fell down before Him. In the presence of all the people, she declared why she had touched Him and how she had been immediately healed.
And He said to her, "Courage, daughter; your faith has brought you salvation. Go in peace."
While He was still speaking, someone from the ruler's house came and said, 'Your daughter is dead; do not trouble the Teacher any longer.'
But Jesus, hearing this, answered him, saying, 'Do not be afraid; only believe, and she will be made well.'
And when He entered the house, He permitted no one to go in except Peter, John, and James, along with the father and mother of the girl.
And all were weeping and mourning for her. But He said, 'Do not weep; she is not dead, but sleeping.'
And they mocked Him, knowing that she was dead.
But He took her by the hand and called, saying, "Child, arise!"
And her spirit returned, and she immediately arose. And He commanded that she be given something to eat.
And her parents were astonished. But He instructed them to tell no one what had happened.
Then He gathered His twelve disciples and gave them power and authority over all demons and to cure diseases.
And He sent them out to proclaim the kingdom of God and to heal the sick.
And He said to them, "Take nothing for your journey: neither a staff, nor a bag, nor bread, nor money; and do not have two tunics."
And into whichever house you enter, there remain, and from there go out.
And as for those who do not welcome you, when you leave that city, shake the dust off your feet as a testimony against them.
And going forth, they journeyed from village to village, proclaiming the good news and healing everywhere.
Now Herod the tetrarch heard all that was happening, and he was perplexed, because it was said by some that John had risen from the dead.
And by some it was said that Elijah had appeared; and by others, that one of the ancient prophets had risen.
And Herod said, 'I beheaded John; but who is this of whom I hear such things?' And he sought to see Him.
And when the apostles returned, they reported to Him all that they had done. Then He took them away privately to a solitary place near the city called Bethsaida.
But when the crowds learned about it, they followed Him. He welcomed them and spoke to them about the kingdom of God, and He healed those in need of healing.
As the day began to wane, the Twelve came to Him and said, 'Send the crowd away, so they can go to the surrounding villages and farms to find lodging and provisions, for we are in a desolate place here.'
But He said to them, 'You give them something to eat.' They replied, 'We have no more than five loaves and two fish, unless we go and buy food for all these people.'
For there were about five thousand men. He said to His disciples, 'Have them sit down in groups of fifty.'
So they did as He instructed and reclined all together.
Taking the five loaves and the two fish, He looked up to heaven and blessed them. Then He broke them and gave them to the disciples to set before the crowd.
And all ate and were filled, and twelve baskets of broken pieces were taken up that remained.
And it happened that while He was alone praying, His disciples joined Him, and He asked them, saying, 'Who do the crowds say that I am?'
They answered, saying, 'John the Baptist; others say Elijah; and still others say that one of the ancient prophets has risen.'
And he said to them, 'But what about you? Who do you say that I am?' Peter answered, 'The Christ of God.'
But he strictly warned them not to tell this to anyone.
saying, 'The Son of Man must suffer many things and be rejected by the elders, chief priests, and scribes, and be killed, and on the third day be raised up.'
And He said to all, "If anyone desires to come after Me, let him deny himself, take up his cross daily, and follow Me."
For whoever desires to save his life will lose it; but whoever loses his life for My sake, this one will save it.
For what does it profit a person if he gains the whole world, but loses himself or suffers the loss of his very being?
For whoever is ashamed of me and my words, the Son of Man will be ashamed of him when he comes in his glory, and the glory of the Father and of the holy angels.
But I tell you truly, there are some standing here who will certainly not taste death until they see the kingdom of God.
Now it came to pass, about eight days after these words, that He took Peter, John, and James, and went up on the mountain to pray.
As He prayed, the appearance of His face was altered, and His clothing became dazzling white.
And behold, two men were conversing with Him, who were Moses and Elijah.
They appeared in glorious splendor and spoke of His departure, which He was about to accomplish in Jerusalem.
But Peter and those who were with him were heavy with sleep; and when they were fully awake, they saw His glory and the two men who stood with Him.
As they were leaving Him, Peter said to Jesus, "Master, it is good for us to be here; let us make three tents—one for You, one for Moses, and one for Elijah." He did not realize what he was saying.
As He was saying these things, a cloud came and overshadowed them; and they were fearful as they entered the cloud.
And a voice came from the cloud, saying, "This is my Son, my Chosen One; listen to Him."
And when the voice had spoken, Jesus was found alone. And they kept silent and told no one in those days any of the things they had seen.
And it came to pass that on the next day, as they were coming down from the mountain, a great crowd met him.
And behold, a man from the crowd cried out, "Teacher, I beg you, look upon my son, for he is my only child."
And behold, a spirit seizes him, and suddenly he cries out and convulses him, so that he is hardly able to leave him, crushing him.
And I implored Your disciples to cast it out, but they were unable.
And responding, Jesus said, 'O faithless and corrupt generation, how long shall I be with you and bear with you? Bring your son here to me.'
While he was still approaching, the demon threw the boy down and convulsed him. But Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit, healed the child, and gave him back to his father.
And all were filled with wonder at the greatness of God. While everyone marveled at all that Jesus did, He said to His disciples,
Let these words sink into your ears: the Son of Man is about to be delivered into the hands of men.
But they did not grasp what He was saying; it was hidden from them so that they would not perceive it, and they were afraid to ask Him about this saying.
Then an argument arose among them as to which of them was the greatest.
But Jesus, knowing the reasoning of their hearts, took a child and had him stand beside Him.
And He said to them, "Whoever receives this child in My name receives Me; and whoever receives Me receives the One who sent Me. For he who is least among you all, he is the greatest."
John replied, "Master, we saw someone casting out demons in Your name, and we stopped him because he does not follow with us."
But Jesus said to him, "Do not hinder him; for he who is not against you is for you."
As the days drew near for him to be taken up, he resolutely set his face to go to Jerusalem.
And He sent messengers ahead of Him. They went into a Samaritan village to make preparations for Him.
But they did not welcome Him, because His face was set toward Jerusalem.
When His disciples James and John saw this, they said, 'Lord, do You want us to command fire to come down from heaven and consume them, as Elijah did?'
But turning to them, He rebuked them, saying, 'You do not know what manner of spirit you are of;'
For the Son of Man did not come to destroy the lives of men, but to save them. And they went to another village.
As they were walking along the road, someone said to Him, 'Lord, I will follow You wherever You go.'
But Jesus said to him, 'Foxes have dens and birds of the air have nests, but the Son of Man has nowhere to rest His head.'
But He said to another, 'Follow Me.' And he said, 'Lord, let me first go and bury my father.'
But Jesus said to him, "Let the spiritually dead bury their own dead. You, however, go and proclaim the kingdom of God."
And another said, 'Lord, I will follow you; but first, let me go say goodbye to those at my home.'
Jesus replied, "No one who puts their hand to the plow and looks back is fit for the kingdom of God."
After this, the Lord appointed seventy others and sent them out two by two ahead of Him to every town and place where He Himself was about to go.
He said to them, "The harvest is plentiful, but the workers are few. Therefore, beseech the Lord of the harvest to send out workers into His harvest."
Go your way; behold, I send you out as lambs among wolves.
Carry no money bag, no traveler's pouch, and do not greet anyone along the way.
Into whatever house you enter, first say, ‘Peace be to this house!’
And if a peaceful man is there, your peace will rest upon him; but if not, it will return to you.
In that house, remain eating and drinking what they provide, for the laborer is worthy of his wages. Do not move from house to house.
And into whatever city you enter, if they receive you, eat what is set before you.
And heal the sick in that city, and say to them, ‘The kingdom of God has drawn near to you.’
But into whichever town you enter, and they do not welcome you, go out into its streets and say:
And regarding the dust that clings to us from your city, we shake it off against you. Nevertheless, know this: the kingdom of God has drawn near to you.
But I tell you, it will be more bearable for Sodom on that day than for that city.
Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! For if the miracles performed among you had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they would have long ago sat in sackcloth and ashes, repenting.
But it will be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon in the judgment than for you.
And you, Capernaum, exalted to the heights, will be brought down to the depths of Hades.
Whoever listens to you listens to me, and whoever disregards you disregards me; and the one who disregards me disregards the one who sent me.
The seventy returned with joy, saying, 'Lord, even the demons submit to us in your name!'
He replied, 'I saw Satan fall like lightning from heaven.'
Behold, I give you the authority to tread upon serpents and scorpions, and over all the power of the enemy, and nothing shall harm you.
Nevertheless, do not rejoice in this, that the spirits are subject to you; but rather rejoice because your names are written in heaven.
In that same hour, Jesus rejoiced in the Spirit and said, 'I praise you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that you have hidden these things from the wise and understanding and revealed them to infants; yes, Father, for such was your gracious will.'
Turning to his disciples, he said, 'All things have been handed over to me by my Father; and no one knows who the Son is except the Father, and who the Father is except the Son, and anyone to whom the Son chooses to reveal him.'
And turning to his disciples privately, he said, 'Blessed are the eyes that see what you see.'
For I tell you that many prophets and kings desired to see what you see, and did not see it, and to hear what you hear, and did not hear it.
And behold, a certain lawyer stood up, testing him, and saying, "Teacher, what must I do to inherit eternal life?"
But He said to him, 'What is written in the Law? How do you read it?'
He answered, 'You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, with all your strength, and with all your mind; and your neighbor as yourself.'
He said to him, 'You have answered correctly; do this, and you will live.'
But he, wishing to justify himself, asked Jesus, 'And who is my neighbor?'
In response, Jesus said, 'A certain man was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho, and he fell among robbers, who stripped him of his clothes, beat him, and departed, leaving him half dead.'
But by chance a certain priest was going down that road, and when he saw him, he passed by on the other side.
Likewise, a Levite, when he came to the place and saw him, passed by on the other side.
But a Samaritan, as he traveled, came where the man was; and when he saw him, he was filled with compassion.
And he approached him, bandaging his wounds, pouring on oil and wine. Then he placed him on his own animal and brought him to an inn, caring for him.
And the next day, he took out two denarii and gave them to the innkeeper, saying, 'Take care of him, and whatever more you may need to spend, I will repay you when I come back.'
Which of these three do you think was a neighbor to the man who fell among the robbers?
And he replied, 'The one who acted with compassion toward him.' Jesus then said to him, 'Go, and do likewise.'
As they continued on their journey, Jesus entered a certain village, and a woman named Martha welcomed him into her home.
And she had a sister named Mary, who sat at the feet of Jesus and listened to his teaching.
But Martha was busy with much serving. And she went up to Him and said, 'Lord, do you not care that my sister has left me to serve alone? Tell her then to help me.'
But Jesus answered her, "Martha, Martha, you are worried and troubled about many things;"}}}  عدم . Thus the phrase captures Jesus’ gentle rebuke while acknowledging Martha’s genuine concerns. It reflects a deep understanding of human anxiety and the call to prioritize spiritual nourishment over worldly distractions.

But one thing is needed. Mary has chosen the good part, which shall not be taken away from her.
Now it happened, while He was praying in a certain place, that when He stopped, one of His disciples said to Him, 'Lord, teach us to pray, just as John also taught his disciples.'
He said to them, 'When you pray, say: Our Father in heaven, hallowed be Your name; let Your kingdom come; let Your will be done, on earth as it is in heaven.'
Give us each day our bread for tomorrow.
And forgive us our sins, for we also forgive everyone indebted to us; and lead us not into temptation, but rescue us from the evil one.
And he said to them, "Which of you has a friend who will go to him at midnight and say to him, 'Friend, lend me three loaves of bread?'
For a friend of mine has come to me from a journey, and I have nothing to set before him.
And he from within will answer, ‘Do not trouble me; the door is already shut, and my children are with me in bed; I cannot rise and give you anything.’
I tell you, even if he will not get up and give him anything because he is his friend, yet because of his boldness, he will rise and give him as much as he needs.
So I say to you: Ask, and it will be given to you; seek, and you will find; knock, and it will be opened to you.
For everyone who asks receives, and he who seeks finds, and to him who knocks it will be opened.
Which of you fathers, if your son asks for a loaf of bread, will give him a stone? Or if he asks for a fish, will give him a serpent instead?
Or if he asks for an egg, will he give him a scorpion?
If you then, being evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will the heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to those who ask Him?
And He was casting out a demon that was mute. When the demon left, the mute spoke, and the crowds were amazed.
But some of them said, 'He casts out demons by Beelzebul, the ruler of the demons.'
Others, to test him, demanded a sign from heaven.
But he, knowing their thoughts, said to them, "Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation, and a house divided against a house falls."
But if Satan is divided against himself, how will his kingdom endure? For you say that I cast out demons by Beelzebul.
But if I cast out demons by Beelzebul, by whom do your sons cast them out? Therefore, they will be your judges.
But if I cast out demons by the finger of God, then the kingdom of God has come upon you.
When a strong man, fully armed, guards his own palace, his possessions are safe.
But when a stronger man comes upon him and overcomes him, he takes away the armor in which he trusted and distributes his spoils.
Whoever is not with me is against me; and whoever does not gather with me scatters.
When the unclean spirit goes out from a person, it roams through dry places seeking rest, and finding none, it says, ‘I will return to the house from which I came.’
And upon returning, it finds the house swept clean and beautifully arranged.
Then it goes and takes seven other spirits more wicked than itself, and they enter in and dwell there; and the last state of that person is worse than the first.
As he was saying these things, a woman in the crowd raised her voice and said to him, 'Blessed is the womb that bore you and the breasts at which you nursed!'
But He said, 'Indeed, blessed are those who hear the word of God and keep it!'
As the crowds gathered around Him, He began to say, 'This generation is a wicked generation. It seeks a sign, and no sign will be given to it except the sign of Jonah the prophet.'
For just as Jonah became a sign to the people of Nineveh, so will the Son of Man be a sign to this generation.
The Queen of the South will rise in judgment with the men of this generation and condemn them, for she came from the farthest parts of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and behold, something greater than Solomon is here.
The men of Nineveh will rise up at the judgment with this generation and condemn it, for they repented at the preaching of Jonah, and behold, something greater than Jonah is here.
No one lights a lamp and puts it in a hidden place or under a basket, but on a lampstand, so that those who come in may see its light.
The eye is the lamp of your body. When your eye is clear, your whole body is also full of light; but when it is bad, your body is also full of darkness.
Therefore, be careful that the light within you is not darkness.
If then your body is all full of light, having no part dark, it will be entirely illuminated, as when the lamp gives you light with its brightness.
While he was speaking, a Pharisee asked him to dine with him. So he went in and reclined at the table.
But the Pharisee, when he saw it, was astonished that he had not first washed before the meal.
But the Lord said to him, 'Now you Pharisees cleanse the outside of the cup and the dish, but inside you are filled with greed and wickedness.'
You fools! Did not the One who made the outside also make the inside?
But rather, give what is within as charity, and behold, everything will be clean for you.
But woe to you, Pharisees! For you meticulously tithe mint, rue, and every kind of herb, yet you neglect justice and the love of God. These you ought to have practiced, without ignoring the others.
Woe to you, Pharisees! For you love the seats of honor in the synagogues and the greetings in the marketplaces.
Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you are like unmarked graves, and the people walking over them are unaware.
One of the lawyers answered him, "Teacher, in saying these things, you insult us as well."
But He said, "Woe to you also, lawyers! For you load men with burdens hard to bear, but you yourselves do not touch the burdens with one of your fingers."
Woe to you! For you build the tombs of the prophets, and your fathers killed them.
Therefore, you testify and approve of the works of your fathers; for they killed the prophets, and you are building their tombs.
For this reason, the wisdom of God declared, ‘I will send them prophets and apostles, and some of them they will kill and persecute.’
so that the blood of all the prophets, which has been shed since the foundation of the world, may be sought after from this generation.
from the blood of Abel to the blood of Zechariah, who was slain between the altar and the sanctuary; yes, I tell you, it will be required of this generation.
Woe to you experts in the law! For you have taken away the key to knowledge. You yourselves did not enter, and you hindered those who were trying to enter.
As He spoke these things, the scribes and the Pharisees began to provoke Him vehemently and to press Him hard about many matters.
They were lurking around Him, seeking to catch something from His mouth, in order that they might accuse Him.
As the crowds gathered in thousands, pressing upon one another, Jesus began to speak first to His disciples, saying, "Beware of the leaven of the Pharisees, which is hypocrisy."
For there is nothing concealed that will not be revealed, nor hidden that will not be known.
Therefore, whatever you have said in the darkness will be heard in the light, and what you have whispered in private rooms will be proclaimed from the rooftops.
I say to you, My friends, do not fear those who can kill the body, and after that have no more they can do.
But I will show you whom you should fear: fear him who, after he has killed, has authority to throw you into hell. Yes, I tell you, fear him!
Are not five sparrows sold for two pennies? And not one of them is forgotten before God.
But even the very hairs of your head are all counted. Therefore, do not fear; you are of more value than many sparrows.
I tell you this: everyone who acknowledges Me before others, the Son of Man will also acknowledge them before the angels of God.
But the one who denies Me in front of people will be denied in front of the angels of God.
And everyone who speaks a word against the Son of Man will be forgiven; but whoever speaks blasphemy against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven.
When they bring you before the synagogues, the rulers, and the authorities, do not worry about how or what you should defend yourselves or what you should say.
For the Holy Spirit will teach you in that very hour what you ought to say.
Then someone from the crowd said to Him, "Teacher, tell my brother to divide the inheritance with me."
But He said to him, "Man, who appointed me to be a judge or divider over you?"
And He said to them, "Take heed and beware of all greed, for one's life does not consist in the abundance of the things he possesses."
And He told them a parable, saying: "The land of a certain rich man produced abundantly."
And he pondered within himself, saying, ‘What shall I do, for I have no place to store my harvest?’
And he said, ‘This is what I will do: I will tear down my barns and build larger ones, and there I will store all my grain and my goods.'
And I will say to my soul, ‘Soul, you have ample goods laid up for many years; relax, eat, drink, and be merry.’
But God said to him, 'Fool, this very night your soul will be demanded of you. And the things you have prepared, whose will they be?'
So it is with the one who treasures up riches for himself and is not rich toward God.
Then He said to His disciples, "For this reason I tell you, do not be anxious about your life, what you will eat; nor about your body, what you will wear."
For life is more than food, and the body is more than clothing.
Consider the ravens: they do not sow or reap; they have no storeroom or barn, yet God feeds them. How much more valuable are you than birds!
And which of you by worrying can add a single hour to his life?
If then you are not able to do even the smallest thing, why are you anxious about the rest?
Consider the lilies, how they grow: they do not labor nor spin; yet I tell you, not even Solomon in all his splendor was clothed like one of these.
But if God clothes the grass of the field, which is here today and tomorrow is thrown into the oven, how much more will He clothe you, O you of little faith?
And you, do not seek what you will eat or what you will drink, and do not let your minds be filled with anxiety.
For all the nations of the world seek after these things, and your Father knows that you need them.
But seek the kingdom of God, and all these things will be given to you as well.
Do not be afraid, little flock, for your Father has been pleased to give you the kingdom.
Sell your possessions and give to the needy. Provide yourselves with money bags that do not grow old, a treasure in the heavens that does not fail, where no thief approaches and no moth destroys.
For where your treasure is, there your heart will also be.
Let your waists be girded and your lamps burning; 
And you yourselves be like men who are waiting for their master, when he returns from the wedding, that when he comes and knocks, they may immediately open to him.
Blessed are those servants whom the master finds alert when he comes. Truly, I say to you, he will gird himself to serve, and have them sit down to eat, and will come and serve them.
And if he should come in the second watch, or in the third watch, and finds them so, blessed are those servants.
But this know, that if the master of the house had been aware of what hour the thief was coming, he would have stayed awake and not allowed his house to be broken into.
Therefore, you also must be ready; for the Son of Man is coming at an hour you do not expect.
Peter said, "Lord, are you telling this parable to us, or to everyone?"
And the Lord said, "Who then is the faithful and wise manager, whom the master will set over his household to give them their portion of food at the proper time?"
Blessed is that servant whom his master will find doing so when he comes.
Truly, I say to you, he will appoint him over all his possessions.
But if that servant says in his heart, ‘My master is taking a long time to return,’ and begins to beat the male and female servants, and to eat and drink and get drunk,
The master of that servant will come on a day he does not expect and at an hour he is not aware of; he will cut him in two and assign him a place with the unfaithful.
That servant who knew his master's will but did not prepare himself or act according to his will will be beaten with many stripes.
But the one who did not know, yet committed deeds worthy of stripes, will be beaten with few. For everyone to whom much was given, much will be required of him, and to whom much has been entrusted, they will ask for more.
I have come to set the earth on fire, and how I wish it were already kindled!
But I have a baptism to be baptized with, and how I am pressed until it is accomplished!
Do you think that I have come to bring peace to the earth? No, I tell you, but rather division.
For from now on, there will be five in one house divided: three against two and two against three.
They will be divided: father against son, and son against father; mother against daughter, and daughter against mother; mother-in-law against daughter-in-law, and daughter-in-law against mother-in-law.
He also said to the crowds, "When you see a cloud rising in the west, immediately you say, ‘A rainstorm is coming,’ and it does."}}} ρους  as  the input text, the output must also  include a distinct interpretation and an explanation of the metaphorical significance of discerning signs.
And when the south wind blows, you say, ‘It will be scorching heat,’ and it happens.
Hypocrites! You know how to discern the appearance of the sky and the earth, but why do you not know how to discern this present time?
And why do you not even of your own accord judge what is right?
As you go with your adversary to the magistrate, make every effort along the way to settle with him, lest he drag you to the judge, and the judge deliver you to the officer, and the officer throw you into prison.
I tell you, you will not leave there until you have paid the very last cent.
At that time, some present reported to Him about the Galileans whose blood Pilate had mixed with their sacrifices.
And Jesus answered them, "Do you think that these Galileans were worse sinners than all the other Galileans because they suffered such things?
No, I tell you; but unless you repent, you will all likewise perish.
Or those eighteen who were killed when the tower in Siloam fell on them; do you think they were worse offenders than all the others living in Jerusalem?
No, I tell you; but unless you repent, you will all likewise perish.
He spoke this parable: A certain man had a fig tree planted in his vineyard, and he came seeking fruit on it and found none.
So he said to the vineyard keeper, 'Look, for three years I have come seeking fruit on this fig tree and find none. Cut it down; why should it use up the ground?'
But he answered him, 'Sir, let it alone this year also, until I dig around it and put manure on it.'
And if it bears fruit next year, well and good; but if not, you can cut it down.'
Now he was teaching in one of the synagogues on the Sabbath.
And behold, there was a woman who had a spirit of infirmity for eighteen years, and she was bent over and could not fully lift herself up.
When Jesus saw her, He called out to her and said, 'Woman, you are freed from your infirmity.'
And He laid His hands on her; and instantly she was made straight, and she glorified God.
But the ruler of the synagogue, indignant because Jesus had healed on the Sabbath, said to the crowd, 'There are six days in which work ought to be done. Come on those days and be healed, and not on the Sabbath day.'
The Lord answered him, "Hypocrite! Does not each of you on the Sabbath untie his ox or his donkey from the stall and lead it away to water it?
And ought not this woman, a daughter of Abraham whom Satan has bound for eighteen years, be loosed from this bond on the Sabbath day?
As He said these things, all His adversaries were put to shame, and all the multitude rejoiced at all the glorious things done by Him.
He said therefore, "To what can the kingdom of God be compared? What shall I use to describe it?
It is like a mustard seed that a man took and planted in his own garden; it grew and became a great tree, and the birds of the air nested in its branches.
Again he asked, "To what shall I compare the Kingdom of God?
It is like yeast that a woman took and hid in three measures of flour until the whole batch was leavened.
And He was journeying through cities and villages, teaching and making His way to Jerusalem.
And someone asked Him, "Lord, are there few who are saved?" And He said to them,
Strive to enter through the narrow door, for I tell you, many will seek to enter and will not be able to.
When the owner of the house rises up and shuts the door, you will begin to stand outside and knock at the door, saying, ‘Lord, Lord, open for us.’ But he will answer and say to you, ‘I do not know where you are from.’
Then you will begin to say, ‘We ate and drank in your presence, and you taught in our streets.’
And he will say, ‘I tell you, I do not know where you come from; depart from me, all you workers of injustice.’
There, in that place, will be weeping and gnashing of teeth, when you see Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and all the prophets in the kingdom of God, but you yourselves are cast out.
And they will come from the east and the west, from the north and the south, and will recline at the table in the kingdom of God.
Indeed, there are those who are last who will be first, and there are those who are first who will be last.
At that very hour, some Pharisees approached him and said, "Get away from here and go somewhere else, for Herod wants to kill you."
And He said to them, 'Go tell that fox, “Behold, I cast out demons and perform healings today and tomorrow, and on the third day I complete my work.”'
Nevertheless, I must journey today, tomorrow, and the day following, for it cannot be that a prophet would perish outside of Jerusalem.
O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, the city that kills the prophets and stones those sent to her! How often I longed to gather your children together, as a hen gathers her chicks under her wings, but you were unwilling!
Behold, your house is left desolate. I tell you, you will not see Me again until you say, ‘Blessed is He who comes in the name of the Lord.’
One Sabbath, when Jesus went to eat at the house of a prominent Pharisee, they were watching Him closely.
And behold, there was a certain man before Him who was suffering from dropsy.
And Jesus answered the lawyers and Pharisees, saying, "Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath?"
But they remained silent. And taking hold of him, He healed him and let him go.
And He responded to them, saying, "Which of you, having a son or an ox that falls into a pit, will not immediately pull him out on the Sabbath day?"
And they could not respond to Him concerning these matters.
He told a parable to those who were invited, observing how they chose the best seats, saying to them:
When you are invited by someone to a wedding feast, do not recline at the place of honor, lest someone more distinguished than you be invited by him.
And when the one who invited you and him comes, he will say to you, ‘Give this man a seat.’ Then you will begin with shame to take the lowest place.
But when you are invited, go and sit in the lowest place, so that when the one who invited you comes, he may say to you, ‘Friend, move up higher.’ Then you will be honored in the presence of all who sit at the table with you.
For everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, and he who humbles himself will be exalted.
And He said to the one who had invited Him, "When you host a banquet or a dinner, do not invite your friends, your brothers, your relatives, or your wealthy neighbors; lest they also invite you in return, and you be repaid.
But when you host a banquet, invite the poor, the crippled, the lame, and the blind.
And you will be blessed, for they cannot repay you; for you will be repaid at the resurrection of the righteous.
When one of those reclining at the table heard these things, he said to Him, "Blessed is the one who will eat bread in the kingdom of God!"
But He said to him, 'A certain man prepared a great feast and invited many guests.'
And he sent his servant at the time of the banquet to tell those who were invited, 'Come, for everything is ready now.'
But they all began to make excuses. The first said to him, 'I have bought a field, and I must go out to see it. I ask you to have me excused.'
And another said, 'I have bought five yoke of oxen, and I am going to examine them. I ask you to excuse me.'
And another said, 'I have married a wife, and therefore I cannot come.'
And when that servant came back, he reported these things to his master. Then, in his anger, the master said to the servant, 'Go out quickly to the streets and lanes of the city, and bring in the poor, the crippled, the blind, and the lame here.'
And the servant said, 'Lord, it is done as you commanded, and there is still room.'
And the lord said to the servant, 'Go out to the roads and hedges, and compel them to come in, so that my house may be filled.'
For I tell you that none of those men who were invited will taste my banquet.
Now great multitudes went with Him. And turning to them, He said,
If anyone comes to Me and does not prioritize Me above his father, mother, wife, children, brothers, sisters, and even his own life, he cannot be My disciple.
And whoever does not bear his own cross and come after me cannot be my disciple.
For which of you, intending to build a tower, does not first sit down and estimate the cost, to see whether he has enough to complete it?
Otherwise, when he has laid the foundation and is unable to finish, all who see it will begin to ridicule him.
saying, 'This man began to build and was not able to finish.'
Or what king, going to engage another king in battle, will not first sit down and consider whether he is able with ten thousand to meet him who comes against him with twenty thousand?
But if he is not able, while he is still far off, he sends a delegation and asks for terms of peace.
So likewise, any one of you who does not renounce all that he possesses cannot be My disciple.
Salt is a good thing; but if salt becomes tasteless, how will it be seasoned?
It is neither fit for the land nor for the manure pile; it is thrown away. He who has ears to hear, let him hear!
Now all the tax collectors and sinners were drawing near to Him to hear Him.
And the Pharisees and scribes began to murmur, saying, 'This man welcomes sinners and eats with them.'
So He told them this parable, saying:
Which one of you, having a hundred sheep, if he loses one of them, does not leave the ninety-nine in the wilderness and go after the lost one until he finds it?
And when he has found it, he joyfully places it on his shoulders.
And upon arriving at his home, he gathers his friends and neighbors, saying to them, 'Rejoice with me, for I have found my lost sheep!'
I tell you that in the same way, there will be joy in heaven over one sinner who repents than over ninety-nine righteous people who have no need of repentance.
Or what woman, having ten silver coins, if she loses one coin, does not light a lamp, sweep the house, and diligently search until she finds it?
And when she finds it, she calls together her friends and neighbors, saying, 'Rejoice with me, for I have found the silver coin that I had lost!'
Just so, I tell you, there is joy before the angels of God over one sinner who repents.
He then said, 'A certain man had two sons.'
And the younger of them said to his father, 'Father, give me the share of the estate that belongs to me.' And he divided his wealth between them.
And not many days later, the younger son gathered all he had and went on a journey to a distant country, where he squandered his inheritance in reckless living.
After he had spent everything, a severe famine arose in that land, and he began to be in need.
So he went and attached himself to one of the citizens of that country, who sent him into his fields to feed pigs.
He longed to fill his belly with the pods that the pigs were eating, but no one gave him anything.
But when he came to himself, he said, 'How many of my father’s hired servants have more than enough bread, but I perish here with hunger!'
I will arise and go to my father, and I will say to him, ‘Father, I have sinned against heaven and before you.'
I am no longer worthy to be called your son; treat me as one of your hired servants.
And he arose and came to his father. But when he was still a great way off, his father saw him and had compassion, and ran and fell on his neck and kissed him.
And the son said to him, ‘Father, I have sinned against heaven and before you, and I am no longer worthy to be called your son.’
But the father said to his servants, ‘Bring out the best robe and clothe him, and put a ring on his hand and sandals on his feet.
And bring the fattened calf here and kill it, and let us eat and celebrate.
For this son of mine was dead and is alive again; he was lost and is found.' And they began to celebrate.
Now his older son was in the field; and as he came near to the house, he heard music and dancing.
And he summoned one of the servants and began to inquire what these things might mean.
And he said to him, 'Your brother has arrived, and your father has killed the fattened calf, because he has received him back safe and sound.'
But he became angry and refused to go in. Therefore, his father came out and entreated him.
But he answered his father, ‘Look, these many years I have served you, and I never disobeyed your command, yet you never gave me even a young goat that I might celebrate with my friends.’
But when this son of yours came, who has wasted your wealth with prostitutes, you killed the fattened calf for him.
‘Son, you are always with me, and everything I have is yours.
But it was right to celebrate and be glad, for this brother of yours was dead and is alive again; he was lost and has been found.
He also said to his disciples, "There was a certain rich man who had a steward, and this steward was accused to him of wasting his goods."
So he called him and said to him, ‘What is this I hear about you? Give an account of your stewardship, for you can no longer be steward.’
Then the steward said within himself, 'What shall I do? For my master is taking away the stewardship from me. I cannot dig; I am ashamed to beg.'
I know what I will do, so that when I am removed from my stewardship, they may welcome me into their own homes.
And calling to himself each of his master's debtors, he said to the first, 'How much do you owe my master?'
He said, 'A hundred measures of oil.' And he said to him, 'Take your bill, and sit down quickly and write fifty.'
Then he said to another, 'And what do you owe?' And he replied, 'A hundred measures of wheat.' He said to him, 'Take your bill, and write eighty.'
And the master commended the unrighteous steward for his shrewdness; for the children of this world are more astute in dealing with their own generation than the children of light.
And I tell you, make friends for yourselves by means of unrighteous wealth, so that when it fails, they may receive you into eternal dwellings.
The one who is faithful in a very little is also faithful in much, and the one who is unjust in a very little is also unjust in much.
So if you have not been faithful in unrighteous wealth, who will entrust to you the true riches?
And if you have not been faithful in that which belongs to another, who will give you what is your own?
No servant can serve two masters; for either he will hate the one and love the other, or he will hold to one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and wealth.
The Pharisees, who were lovers of money, heard all these things and ridiculed Him.
And He said to them, 'You justify yourselves before others, but God knows your hearts; for what is revered among men is detestable in the sight of God.'
The Law and the Prophets were until John; since then, the Kingdom of God is being proclaimed, and everyone is forcefully pressing into it.
But it is easier for heaven and earth to pass away than for one stroke of a letter of the Law to fall.
Everyone who divorces his wife and marries another commits adultery, and he who marries a woman who is divorced from her husband commits adultery.
There was a certain rich man who was clothed in purple and fine linen, living in splendid luxury every day.
But there was a certain beggar named Lazarus, who was laid at his gate, covered with sores.
And longing to be filled with the crumbs that fell from the rich man's table; moreover, even the dogs came and licked his sores.
And it came to pass that the poor man died and was carried away by the angels to Abraham's side; the rich man also died and was buried.
And in Hades, lifting up his eyes while in torment, he saw Abraham from afar, and Lazarus in his bosom.
And he cried out, 'Father Abraham, have mercy on me, and send Lazarus so that he may dip the tip of his finger in water and cool my tongue, for I am in agony in this flame.'
But Abraham said, 'Child, remember that you received your good things in your lifetime, and Lazarus in like manner bad things; but now he is comforted here, and you are in anguish.'
And besides all this, a great chasm has been fixed between us and you, so that those who wish to pass from here to you cannot, nor can anyone cross over from there to us.
And he said, 'Then I ask you, father, to send him to my father's house.'
For I have five brothers; let him warn them, so that they will not also come to this place of torment.
But Abraham said to him, 'They have Moses and the prophets; let them hear them.'
But he said, 'No, father Abraham, but if someone goes to them from the dead, they will repent.'
But he said to him, 'If they do not listen to Moses and the Prophets, neither will they be convinced if someone rises from the dead.'
He said to His disciples, "It is impossible for offenses not to come, but woe to the one through whom they come!"
It would be better for him if a large millstone were hung around his neck and he were thrown into the sea than for him to cause one of these little ones to stumble.
Take heed to yourselves. If your brother sins against you, rebuke him; and if he repents, forgive him.
And if he sins against you seven times in a day, and seven times returns to you, saying, 'I repent,' you must forgive him.
The apostles said to the Lord, 'Increase our faith.'
And the Lord said, "If you have faith like a mustard seed, you could say to this mulberry tree, 'Be uprooted and planted in the sea,' and it would obey you."
But which of you, having a servant plowing or tending sheep, will say to him when he has come in from the field, 'Come at once and sit down to eat'?
But will he not rather say to him, ‘Prepare my meal, and gird yourself and serve me until I have eaten and drunk, and afterward you will eat and drink’?
Does he thank the servant because he did what was commanded? I think not.
So you also, when you have done all that you were commanded, say, ‘We are unworthy servants; we have only done what was our duty.’
As He was on His way to Jerusalem, He was passing through the region between Samaria and Galilee.
As He entered a certain village, ten men who had leprosy met Him; they stood at a distance.
And they raised their voices, saying, "Jesus, Master, have mercy on us!"
When He saw them, He said to them, 'Go and show yourselves to the priests.' And as they went, they were cleansed.
One of them, when he saw that he was healed, turned back with a loud voice, praising God.
And he fell on his face at His feet, giving thanks to Him; and he was a Samaritan.
And Jesus answered, "Were not ten cleansed? But where are the nine?"
Was no one found to return and give glory to God except this foreigner?
And He said to him, "Rise and go your way; your faith has made you well."
When asked by the Pharisees when the kingdom of God would come, He answered them and said, "The kingdom of God does not come with signs to be observed."
Nor will they say, 'Look, here it is!' or 'There it is!' For behold, the kingdom of God is within you.
And He said to the disciples, 'The days are coming when you will long to see one of the days of the Son of Man, but you will not see it.'
And they will say to you, 'Look, here!' or 'Look, there!' Do not go after them or follow them.
For just as lightning flashes and shines from one part of the sky to the other, so will it be on the day of the Son of Man.
But first, He must suffer greatly and be rejected by this generation.
Just as it was in the days of Noah, so will it be in the days of the Son of Man.
They were eating and drinking, marrying and being given in marriage, until the day that Noah entered the ark, and the flood came and destroyed them all.
Likewise, just as it was in the days of Lot: they were eating, drinking, buying, selling, planting, and building.
But on the day Lot left Sodom, fire and sulfur rained down from heaven and destroyed them all.
It will be the same on the day when the Son of Man is revealed.
On that day, let the one who is on the roof and his belongings in the house not go down to take them away, and likewise, let the one who is in the field not turn back.
Remember Lot’s wife.
Whoever seeks to preserve their life will lose it, but whoever loses their life will keep it.
I tell you, in that night there will be two people on one bed; one will be taken and the other will be left.
Two women will be grinding grain together; one will be taken and the other will be left.
Two will be in the field; one will be taken and the other will be left behind.
And they answered Him, 'Where, Lord?' He said to them, 'Wherever the body is, there the eagles will be gathered together.'
And He told them a parable to show that they should always pray and not lose heart.
He said: "In a certain city, there was a judge who did not fear God nor regard man."
And there was a widow in that city; and she came to him, saying, 'Grant me justice against my adversary.'
And for a time he refused; but afterward he said to himself, 'Though I do not fear God nor respect man,'.
Yet because this widow keeps bothering me, I will grant her justice, so that she will not wear me out by her continual coming.
And the Lord said, 'Listen to what the unjust judge says;'
And will not God bring about justice for His chosen ones who cry out to Him day and night? Will He keep putting them off?
I tell you that He will surely bring about justice for them swiftly. But when the Son of Man comes, will He find faith on the earth?
He also told this parable to some who trusted in themselves that they were righteous and despised others:
Two men went up to the temple to pray, one a Pharisee and the other a tax collector.
The Pharisee stood by himself and prayed this: ‘God, I thank You that I am not like other men—robbers, evildoers, adulterers—or even like this tax collector here.
I fast twice a week and give a tenth of all I acquire.
But the tax collector, standing far off, would not even lift his eyes to heaven, but beat his breast, saying, 'God, have mercy on me, a sinner!'
I tell you, this man went down to his house justified rather than the other; for everyone who lifts himself up will be brought low, but he who humbles himself will be lifted high.
People were also bringing babies to Him so that He might touch them; but when the disciples saw it, they rebuked them.
But Jesus called them to Him, saying, "Let the children come to Me, and do not hinder them; for to such belongs the kingdom of God."
Truly, I tell you, whoever does not receive the kingdom of God like a child will never enter it.
And a ruler asked him, saying, "Good Teacher, what must I do to inherit eternal life?"
But Jesus said to him, "Why do you call me good? No one is good except for God alone."
You know the commandments: Do not commit adultery, do not murder, do not steal, do not give false testimony, honor your father and your mother.
He replied, 'I have kept all these commandments since my youth.'
When Jesus heard this, He said to him, 'There is still one thing you lack: Sell all that you have and distribute to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven. Then come, follow me.'
But when he heard these things, he became very sad, for he was extremely wealthy.
But seeing him distressed, Jesus said, "How hard it is for those who possess wealth to enter the kingdom of God!"
For it is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than for a wealthy person to enter the kingdom of God.
Those who heard this said, 'Then who can possibly be saved?'
But He said, "What is impossible for people is possible for God."
And Peter said, 'Look, we have forsaken everything and followed you.'
And He said to them, 'Truly, I say to you, there is no one who has left house or parents or brothers or wife or children for the sake of the Kingdom of God,
who will not receive many times more in this present age, and in the age to come, eternal life.
Then he took the twelve aside and said to them, 'Look, we are going up to Jerusalem, and all that is written by the prophets about the Son of Man will be accomplished.'
For He will be handed over to the Gentiles, and they will mock Him, mistreat Him, and spit upon Him.
and after scourging Him, they will kill Him, but on the third day He will rise again.
But they did not understand any of these things. This saying was hidden from them, and they did not grasp what was said.
As Jesus drew near to Jericho, a certain blind man was sitting by the roadside begging.
And hearing the multitude passing by, he asked what this meant.
They reported to him that Jesus of Nazareth was passing by.
And he shouted, saying, 'Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me!'
And those who led the way rebuked him, telling him to be quiet; but he cried out all the more, 'Son of David, have mercy on me!'
So Jesus stood still and ordered him to be brought to Him. When the man approached, Jesus asked him, saying,
Jesus asked him, "What do you want me to do for you?" The blind man replied, "Lord, that I may receive my sight."
And Jesus said to him, "Receive your sight; your faith has healed you."
And immediately he regained his sight and followed Him, glorifying God. And all the people, when they saw it, gave praise to God.
And as He entered, He was passing through Jericho.
And behold, there was a man named Zacchaeus; he was a chief tax collector, and he was wealthy.
And he sought to see who Jesus was, but could not because of the crowd, for he was short in stature.
So he ran on ahead and climbed up into a sycamore tree to see him, for he was about to pass that way.
When Jesus reached the spot, He looked up and said to him, "Zacchaeus, hurry down! For I must stay at your house today."
So he hurried down and joyfully welcomed Him.
All the people saw this and began to mutter, "He has gone to be the guest of a man who is a sinner."
But Zacchaeus stood up and said to the Lord, 'Look, Lord! Here and now I give half of my possessions to the poor, and if I have cheated anyone out of anything, I will pay back four times the amount.'
Jesus said to him, 'Today salvation has come to this house, because this man too is a son of Abraham.'
For the Son of Man came to seek and to save what was lost.
While they were listening to these things, He added and spoke a parable, because He was near Jerusalem, and they supposed that the kingdom of God was going to appear immediately.
Therefore He said, 'A certain nobleman went to a distant country to receive a kingdom for himself, and then return.'
Calling ten of his servants, he gave them ten minas and said to them, 'Engage in trade until I come back.'
But his citizens hated him and sent a delegation after him, saying, 'We do not want this man to reign over us.'
And it happened that when he returned, having received the kingdom, he commanded that those servants be called to him to whom he had given the money, so that he might know what each had gained by trading.
The first came forward, saying, ‘Master, your mina has earned ten minas more.’
And he said to him, ‘Well done, good servant! Because you have been faithful in a very small matter, you shall have authority over ten cities.’
And the second came, saying, ‘Lord, your mina has earned five minas more.’
And to him he said, ‘And you shall be in charge of five cities.’
And another came, saying, ‘Lord, behold, here is your mina, which I kept laid away in a handkerchief.'
For I was afraid of you, because you are a severe man; you take up what you did not lay down, and reap what you did not sow.
He said to him, 'By your own words I will judge you, you wicked servant. You knew that I am a harsh man, taking up what I did not lay down and reaping what I did not sow.
And why did you not place my money on deposit, so that when I returned, I could have collected it with interest?
And to those standing by, he said, 'Take the mina away from him and give it to the one who has ten minas.'
And they said to him, 'Master, he has ten minas already.'
I tell you that to everyone who has, more will be given; but from the one who does not have, even what he thinks he has will be taken away from him.
But as for these enemies of mine, who did not want me to reign over them, bring them here and slay them in my presence.
And after saying these things, He went on ahead, ascending toward Jerusalem.
And it came to pass that as He approached Bethphage and Bethany, near the mount called Olives, He sent two of His disciples.
Saying, 'Go to the village ahead of you; there, as you enter, you will find a colt tied, on which no one has ever sat. Untie it and bring it here.'
And if anyone asks you, 'Why are you untying it?' you shall say to them, 'The Lord has need of it.'
So those who were sent went away and found it just as He had told them, standing there.
As they were untying the colt, its owners asked them, 'Why are you untying the colt?'
They said, 'The Lord has need of it.'
And they brought it to Jesus, and throwing their own garments on the colt, they set Jesus on it.
As He went along, they spread their cloaks on the road.
As He was drawing near, already at the descent of the Mount of Olives, the whole multitude of His disciples began to rejoice and praise God with a loud voice for all the mighty works that they had seen.
They cried out, 'Blessed is the King who comes in the name of the Lord! Peace in heaven and glory in the highest!'
And some of the Pharisees from the crowd said to Him, 'Teacher, rebuke Your disciples.'
But He answered and said to them, 'I tell you that if these should keep silent, the stones would immediately cry out.'
And as He drew near, seeing the city, He wept over it.
saying, "If you had known, even you, especially in this your day, the things that make for your peace! But now they are hidden from your eyes.
For days are coming upon you when your enemies will lay siege to you and encircle you, and they will press in on you from every side.
and they will crush you and your children within you; they will not leave in you one stone upon another, because you did not recognize the time of your visitation.
And he entered the temple and began to drive out those who were selling and buying there.
saying to them, 'It is written, "My house shall be a house of prayer," but you have turned it into a den of robbers.'
And he was teaching daily in the temple; but the chief priests and the scribes sought to destroy him, as did the leading men of the people.
And they could not find a way to act, for all the people were hanging on his words.
Now it happened that on one of those days, while He was teaching the people in the temple and proclaiming the good news, the chief priests and the scribes, along with the elders, approached Him.
They spoke to Him, saying, "Tell us, by what authority are You doing these things? Or who is it that gave You this authority?"
But He answered and said to them, "I will ask you one question as well; answer Me this, and I will tell you by what authority I do these things."
Was the baptism of John from heaven, or was it from men?
But they reasoned among themselves, saying, 'If we say, ‘From heaven,’ he will say, ‘Why then did you not believe him?’
But if we say, ‘From men,’ the people will stone us, for they are convinced that John was a prophet.
So they answered that they did not know where it was from.
And Jesus said to them, "Nor will I tell you by what authority I do these things."
He began to tell the people this parable: "A certain man planted a vineyard, and leased it to farmers, and went away for a long time."
At the appropriate time, he sent a servant to the farmers to receive some of the vineyard's fruit; but the farmers beat him and sent him away empty-handed.
And he added to send another servant; but they beat him also and treated him with contempt, and sent him away empty-handed.
And he sent a third servant. But they also wounded him and cast him out.
Then the owner of the vineyard said, 'What shall I do? I will send my beloved Son; perhaps when they see him, they will feel ashamed.'
But when the tenants saw him, they reasoned among themselves, saying, 'This is the heir. Come, let us kill him, so that the inheritance may be ours.'
And having thrown him out of the vineyard, they killed him. What then will the owner of the vineyard do to them?
He will come and destroy those farmers, and will give the vineyard to others." Upon hearing this, they exclaimed, "God forbid!"
But he looked directly at them and said, 'What then does this Scripture mean: “The stone that the builders rejected has become the cornerstone”?'
Everyone who falls on that stone will be shattered; but upon whomsoever it falls, it will grind him to powder.
The chief priests and the scribes sought to lay hands on Him at that very hour, but they feared the people, for they knew that He had spoken this parable against them.
So they watched Him closely and sent out spies, pretending to be righteous, in order to catch Him in something He might say, so they could deliver Him to the authority and power of the governor.
So they questioned Him, saying, 'Teacher, we know that you speak and teach rightly, and you do not show favoritism, but truly teach the way of God.'
Is it lawful for us to give tribute to Caesar, or not?
But perceiving their cunning, He said to them, 'Why do you test me?'
Show me a denarius. Whose likeness and inscription does it bear? They replied, 'Caesar's.'
He said to them, 'Then give to Caesar what belongs to Caesar, and to God what belongs to God.'
And they could not seize upon His words in opposition to the people; and marveling at His reply, they fell silent.
Then some of the Sadducees, who deny that there is a resurrection, came to Him and questioned Him.
They asked Him, "Teacher, Moses wrote for us that if a man's brother dies, leaving a wife but no children, the man must take the wife and raise up children for his brother."
Now there were seven brothers; and the first took a wife, and died without children.
And the second brother took her as his wife, and he also died without leaving any children.
And the third also took her, and in the same manner, all seven died, leaving no children.
Finally, the woman also died.
In the resurrection, therefore, whose wife does she become? For the seven had her as a wife.
And Jesus answered them, "The sons of this age marry and are given in marriage;"
But those who are deemed worthy to attain that age and the resurrection from the dead neither marry nor are given in marriage.
For they can no longer die, because they are like angels and are children of God, being children of the resurrection.
But concerning the resurrection of the dead, even Moses revealed this at the burning bush, when he calls the Lord the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.
For God is not the God of the dead, but of the living; for all are alive to Him.
And some of the scribes answered and said, Teacher, You have spoken well.
And they no longer dared to ask Him anything.
But He said to them, 'How is it that they say the Christ is the Son of David?'
And David himself says in the book of Psalms, 'The Lord said to my Lord, “Sit at my right hand.”'
until I make your enemies a footstool for your feet.
David calls him 'Lord.' How then can he be his son?
While all the people were listening, he said to his disciples,
Beware of the scribes who desire to walk in long robes, and love greetings in the marketplaces, the best seats in the synagogues, and the places of honor at banquets.
They devour the houses of widows and for the sake of appearance make long prayers; these will receive a greater judgment.
As He looked up, Jesus saw the rich putting their gifts into the treasury.
And He saw a poor widow putting in two small coins there.
And He said, "Truly I tell you, this poor widow has put in more than all the others."
For all these gave from their surplus to the offerings of God, but she, out of her poverty, gave all she had to live on.
And as some were speaking of the temple, how it was adorned with beautiful stones and gifts dedicated to God, He said,
As for what you see here, the days will come when there will not be left a stone upon another that will not be torn down.
And they asked him, saying, "Teacher, when will these things be? And what will be the sign when these things are about to happen?"
And He said, "Watch yourselves that you are not led astray; for many will come in My name, saying, 'I am He,' and, 'The time has come near.' Do not follow them."
But when you hear of wars and upheavals, do not be frightened; for these things must happen first, but the end will not come immediately.
Then He said to them, ‘Nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom.’
And there will be great earthquakes in various places, and famines and pestilences; and there will be fearful sights and great signs from heaven.
But before all these things, they will lay their hands on you and persecute you, delivering you up to synagogues and prisons, and bringing you before kings and governors because of my name.
This will turn out to be your opportunity for testimony.
So set in your hearts not to premeditate how to defend yourselves.
For I will give you a mouth and wisdom, which none of your adversaries will be able to contradict or resist.
But you will be betrayed even by parents and relatives, friends and brothers, and they will put some of you to death.
And you will be hated by all because of my name.
But not a hair on your head will perish.
By your patience, you will secure your souls.
But when you see Jerusalem surrounded by armies, then know that its desolation is near.
Then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains, and let those who are in the city depart, and let not those who are in the countryside enter her.
For these are the days of vengeance, when all that has been written must be fulfilled.
But woe to those who are pregnant and to those who are nursing babies in those days! For there will be great distress upon the earth, and wrath upon this people.
And they will fall by the edge of the sword, and will be led away captive into all nations, and Jerusalem will be trampled by the Gentiles until the times of the Gentiles are fulfilled.
And there will be signs in the sun, and in the moon, and in the stars; and on the earth, nations will be in anguish, confused by the roaring of the sea and the waves.
People will faint from fear and anticipation of what is coming upon the world, for the powers of heaven will be shaken.
And then they will see the Son of Man coming in a cloud with great power and great glory.
But when these things begin to take place, straighten up and lift up your heads, because your redemption is drawing near.
And He told them a parable: "Look at the fig tree, and all the trees.
When they are already putting forth leaves, you see for yourselves and know that summer is now near.
So you also, when you see these things happening, know that the Kingdom of God is near.
Truly, I say to you, this generation will not pass away until all things have taken place.
Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will never pass away.
But take heed to yourselves, lest your hearts be weighed down with the excesses of indulgence and the cares of life, and that day come upon you unexpectedly.
For it will come as a snare upon all those who dwell on the face of the whole earth.
Therefore, stay alert at all times, praying that you may be counted worthy to escape all these things that are about to happen, and to stand before the Son of Man.
During the days, he was teaching in the temple; but at night he would go out and stay on the Mount called Olivet.
And all the people rose early to come to him at the temple to hear him.
Now the Feast of Unleavened Bread, which is called the Passover, was approaching.
And the chief priests and the scribes were seeking how they might put him to death, for they feared the people.
Then Satan entered into Judas, who was called Iscariot, one of the twelve.
And having departed, he conferred with the chief priests and the scribes and the captains about how he might betray Him to them.
And they rejoiced and agreed to give him silver.
So he agreed and sought a suitable opportunity to betray Him to them without the crowd.
Then came the day of unleavened bread, on which the Passover had to be sacrificed.
So He sent Peter and John, saying, 'Go and make preparations for us to eat the Passover.'
They asked Him, 'Where do You want us to prepare for You to eat the Passover?'
He said to them, 'Behold, when you enter the city, a man carrying a jar of water will meet you. Follow him to the house he enters.
And you shall say to the owner of the house, ‘The Teacher asks you, Where is the guest room where I may eat the Passover with my disciples?’
And he will show you a large furnished upper room; there make ready.
So they went and found everything just as He had told them, and they prepared the Passover.
When the hour had come, He reclined at the table, and the twelve apostles were with Him.
And He said to them, "With great desire I have longed to eat this Passover with you before I suffer."
For I say to you, I will no longer eat of it until it is fulfilled in the kingdom of God.
And taking the cup, he gave thanks and said, 'Take this and share it among yourselves;'
For I tell you that I will not drink of the fruit of the vine until the kingdom of God comes.
And he took bread, and after giving thanks, he broke it and gave it to them, saying, "This is my body, which is given for you; do this in remembrance of me."
Likewise, after the meal, he took the cup, saying, "This cup is the new covenant established in my blood, which is being poured out for you."
But behold, the hand of the one who betrays me is with me at the table.
For the Son of Man is going away as it has been predetermined; but woe to that man by whom he is betrayed.
And they began to question one another about who among them it could be that would do this.
A dispute also arose among them about which of them would be regarded as the greatest.
But Jesus said to them, "The kings of the nations exercise dominion over them, and those in authority are called benefactors."
But you are not to be like that. Rather, let the greatest among you become as the youngest, and the leader as one who serves.
For who is greater, the one who reclines at the table or the one who serves? Is it not the one who reclines? But I am among you as the one who serves.
But you are those who have stood by Me in My trials.
And I grant you a kingdom, just as my Father granted it to me.
so that you may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom, and sit on thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel.
And the Lord said, "Simon, Simon! Behold, Satan has asked for you, that he might sift you as wheat.
But I have prayed for you, that your faith may not fail; and when you have returned, strengthen your brothers.
But he said to Him, "Lord, I am ready to go with You, both to prison and to death."
But He said, "I tell you, Peter, the rooster will not crow today before you deny three times that you know Me."
And He said to them, 'When I sent you out without money bags, knapsacks, and sandals, did you lack anything?' They said, 'Nothing.'
He said to them, 'But now, let the one who has a money bag take it, and likewise a knapsack; and let the one who has no sword sell his cloak and buy one.'
For I tell you that this Scripture must be fulfilled in me: 'He was counted among the lawless'; for what is written about me is reaching its fulfillment.
And they said, "Lord, look, here are two swords." And He replied, "It is enough."
And going out, He proceeded as was His custom to the Mount of Olives; and His disciples also followed Him.
And when He came to the place, He said to them, 'Pray that you may not enter into temptation.'
And he withdrew from them about a stone's throw, and kneeling down, he prayed.
saying, "Father, if You are willing, take this cup away from me; nevertheless, not my will, but Yours be done."
Then an angel appeared to Him from heaven, strengthening Him.
And being in agony, He prayed more earnestly; and His sweat became like great drops of blood falling down to the ground.
And when He rose from prayer and went to His disciples, He found them asleep, weighed down by sorrow.
And He said to them, 'Why are you sleeping? Arise and pray, so that you do not enter into temptation.'
While He was still speaking, a crowd appeared, and Judas, one of the twelve, was leading them. He approached Jesus to kiss Him.
But Jesus said to him, "Judas, are you betraying the Son of Man with a kiss?"
When those around Him saw what was about to happen, they said, 'Lord, should we strike with a sword?'
And one of them struck the servant of the high priest and cut off his right ear.
But Jesus responded, 'Allow this much,' and touching his ear, He healed him.
Then Jesus said to those who had come against Him—the chief priests, the captains of the temple, and the elders—'Have you come out with swords and clubs as if I were a bandit?'
Every day I was with you in the temple, yet you did not reach out your hands against me. But this is your hour, the time when darkness holds sway.
Then they seized him and led him away into the high priest's house. But Peter followed at a distance.
And when they had lit a fire in the middle of the courtyard and were sitting together, Peter sat among them.
But a certain servant girl, seeing him sitting in the light, looked closely at him and said, 'This man also was with him.'
But he denied it, saying, 'Woman, I do not know him.'
And after a little while, another saw him and said, 'You also are one of them.' But Peter said, 'Man, I am not.'
About an hour later, another asserted confidently, 'Certainly this man was with him, for he is a Galilean.'
But Peter said, 'Man, I do not know what you are talking about.' And immediately, while he was still speaking, a rooster crowed.
And turning, the Lord looked at Peter. And Peter remembered the word of the Lord, how He had said to him, 'Before the rooster crows, you will deny Me three times.'
And when he had gone outside, Peter wept bitterly.
And the men who were holding Jesus mocked Him, striking Him.
And having covered His face, they struck Him on the cheeks and questioned Him, saying, 'Prophesy, who is the one that struck You?'
And they spoke many other blasphemous things against Him.
When day broke, the council of the people assembled, along with the chief priests and the scribes, and they brought Him before their council, saying:
If You are the Christ, tell us plainly. But He said to them, 'If I tell you, you will not believe me;'
And if I were to ask you, you would neither answer me nor let me go.
But from now on, the Son of Man will be seated at the right hand of the power of God.
Then they all said, "Are You then the Son of God?" He said to them, "You rightly say that I am."
And they said, 'What further need do we have for testimony? For we ourselves have heard it from his own mouth.'
Then the entire multitude of them arose and led Him away to Pilate.
And they began to accuse Him, saying, 'We found this man perverting our nation and forbidding to pay taxes to Caesar, saying that He Himself is Christ, a King.'
Then Pilate asked Him, 'Are You the King of the Jews?' Jesus answered him, 'You say so.'
Then Pilate said to the chief priests and the crowd, 'I find no charge against this man.'
But they insisted, saying, 'He stirs up the people, teaching throughout all Judea, beginning from Galilee all the way here.'
Upon hearing this, Pilate asked if the man was from Galilee.
And realizing that He was under the authority of Herod, he sent Him back to Herod, for he was also in Jerusalem during those days.
When Herod saw Jesus, he was greatly pleased; for he had long wanted to see Him because he had heard so many things about Him, and he hoped to see some miracle performed by Him.
He questioned Him with probing words, but Jesus gave him no answer.
And the scribes and the chief priests stood vehemently accusing Him.
Then Herod, with his soldiers, treated Him with contempt and mocked Him. They dressed Him in a splendid robe and sent Him back to Pilate.
That day, Herod and Pilate became friends; for before this, they had been enemies with each other.
Pilate then summoned the chief priests, the rulers, and the people.
He said to them, 'You brought this man to me as one who misleads the people, and behold, I have examined Him in your presence and have found no reason for the charges you bring against Him.'
But neither did Herod, for I sent you to him, and behold, he has found nothing deserving of death in Him.
Therefore, I will chastise him and release him.
For he was obligated to release one prisoner to them at the feast.
But they all cried out together, saying, 'Away with this man, and release to us Barabbas!'
who had been thrown into prison for a certain insurrection that had taken place in the city, and for murder.
Then Pilate spoke again, wishing to release Jesus.
But they shouted, saying, "Crucify Him! Crucify Him!"
But he said to them a third time, "Why? What wrong has this man done? I have found no reason for death in him; therefore I will chastise him and release him."
But they persisted with loud voices, demanding that he be crucified. Their voices, along with those of the chief priests, prevailed.
So Pilate decided that their request should be granted.
So he released to them Barabbas, the one who had been imprisoned for insurrection and murder, whom they had asked for; but he handed Jesus over to their will.
And as they led him away, they seized a certain Simon of Cyrene, who was coming in from the field, and they laid the cross upon him to carry it behind Jesus.
And a large crowd of people followed Him, including women who were mourning and lamenting for Him.
But Jesus turned to them and said, "Daughters of Jerusalem, do not weep for me; weep rather for yourselves and for your children."
For behold, the days are coming when they will say, 'Blessed are the barren and the wombs that never bore, and the breasts that never nursed.'
Then they will begin to say to the mountains, 'Fall upon us!' and to the hills, 'Cover us!'
For if they do these things when the tree is green, what will happen when it is dry?
They also led away two other criminals to be executed with Him.
When they arrived at the place called the Skull, they crucified Him there, along with the criminals—one on His right and the other on His left.
But Jesus said, "Father, forgive them, for they do not understand what they are doing." And they divided His garments and cast lots.
And the people stood by watching, but the rulers scoffed at Him, saying, 'He saved others; let Him save Himself, if He is the Christ, the chosen one of God.'
The soldiers also mocked Him, coming up and offering Him sour wine.
and saying, "If You are the King of the Jews, save Yourself!"
There was also an inscription written above Him in letters of Greek, Latin, and Hebrew: "This is the King of the Jews."
One of the criminals hanging there railed at him, saying, 'Aren’t you the Messiah? Save yourself and us!'
But the other answered and rebuked him, saying, 'Do you not fear God, since you are under the same condemnation?'
And we indeed are suffering justly; for we are receiving what we deserve for our deeds; but this man has done nothing wrong.
And he said to Jesus, 'Lord, remember me when You come into Your kingdom.'
And Jesus said to him, 'Truly, I say to you, today you will be with Me in paradise.'
It was now about the sixth hour, and darkness fell over the whole land until the ninth hour, as the sun was obscured.
And the veil of the temple was torn in two, right down the middle.
And Jesus cried out with a loud voice, 'Father, into Your hands I commit my spirit.' Having said this, He breathed His last.
When the centurion saw what had happened, he glorified God, saying, 'Certainly, this man was righteous.'
And all the crowds that had gathered to witness this spectacle, seeing what had happened, began to beat their breasts and returned home.
But all His acquaintances stood at a distance, watching these things, and the women who had followed Him from Galilee were also there, observing.
And behold, there was a man named Joseph, a member of the council, a good and righteous man.
This man had not agreed with their plan and action. He was from the city of Arimathea in Judea, and he was himself waiting for the kingdom of God.
This man went to Pilate and requested the body of Jesus.
And taking it down, he wrapped it in a linen cloth and placed it in a hewn tomb, where no one had yet been laid.
It was the day of Preparation, and the Sabbath was about to begin.
And the women who had come with Him from Galilee followed, and they observed the tomb and how His body was laid.
Then they returned and prepared spices and fragrant oils. And they rested on the Sabbath according to the commandment.
But on the first day of the week, very early in the morning, they came to the tomb, bringing the spices they had prepared, and certain others with them.
They found the stone rolled away from the entrance of the tomb.
And when they entered, they did not find the body of the Lord Jesus.
And while they were perplexed about this, suddenly two men stood beside them in gleaming attire.
And as they were filled with fear and bowed their faces to the ground, the men said to them, "Why do you seek the living among the dead?"
He is not here; He has risen! Remember how He told you while He was still in Galilee,
saying, 'The Son of Man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men, and be crucified, and on the third day rise again.'
And they remembered His words,
And returning from the tomb, they reported all these things to the eleven and to all the others.
It was Mary Magdalene, Joanna, Mary the mother of James, and the other women with them who told these things to the apostles.
And their words appeared to them as idle tales, and they did not believe them.
But Peter rose up and ran to the tomb. Stooping down, he saw the linen cloths lying alone; and he went away to his own home, marveling at what had happened.
And behold, two of them were traveling that very day to a village called Emmaus, which was about sixty stadia from Jerusalem.
And they were conversing with one another about all these events that had happened.
And as they were talking and discussing, Jesus Himself drew near and walked with them.
But their eyes were restrained, so they did not recognize Him.
He said to them, "What are these words you are exchanging with each other as you walk, and why are you so troubled?"
One of them, named Cleopas, answered him, "Are you the only visitor in Jerusalem who does not know the things that have happened there in these days?"
And He said to them, "What things?" And they said to Him, "The things concerning Jesus of Nazareth, who was a mighty prophet in deed and word before God and all the people.
How the chief priests and our rulers delivered Him to be sentenced to death and crucified Him.
But we had hoped that He was the one to redeem Israel. Yet, with all these things, today is the third day since these events took place.
But also, some of the women among us astonished us. They were at the tomb early in the morning.
and when they did not find his body, they came saying that they had seen a vision of angels who said that he is alive.
And some of those who were with us went to the tomb, and they found it just as the women had said; but they did not see him.
And He said to them, "O foolish ones, and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken!
Was it not necessary for the Messiah to suffer these things and then enter into His glory?
And beginning with Moses and all the prophets, He explained to them everything that was said in all the Scriptures concerning Himself.
As they approached the village to which they were going, Jesus acted as if He were going further.
But they urged Him strongly, saying, "Stay with us, for it is nearly evening, and the day is almost gone." So He went in to stay with them.
And it came to pass, when He reclined at the table with them, that He took the bread, blessed it, and breaking it, gave it to them.
Then their eyes were opened, and they recognized Him; but He became invisible to them.
And they said to one another, "Did not our hearts burn within us as He spoke to us on the road, while He opened to us the Scriptures?"
And they arose that very hour and returned to Jerusalem, where they found the eleven gathered together with their companions.
saying, "The Lord has truly risen, and He has appeared to Simon!"
And they were recounting what had happened on the road, and how He was made known to them in the breaking of the bread.
While they were still talking about these things, Jesus Himself stood among them and said to them, 'Peace be with you.'
But they were startled and frightened, and thought they saw a spirit.
And He said to them, 'Why are you so troubled, and why do doubts arise in your hearts?'
Look at my hands and my feet; it is I myself. Touch me and see; a spirit does not have flesh and bones, as you see I have.
And having said this, He showed them His hands and His feet.
And while they still could not believe because of their joy and amazement, He asked them, "Do you have anything here to eat?"
They gave Him a piece of broiled fish and some honeycomb.
And He took it, and in their presence, He ate.
He said to them, "These are my words that I spoke to you while I was still with you, that everything written about me in the Law of Moses, the Prophets, and the Psalms must be fulfilled."
Then he opened their minds to understand the Scriptures.
And he said to them, 'Thus it is written that the Christ would suffer and rise from the dead on the third day.'
and that repentance and forgiveness of sins should be proclaimed in His name to all nations, beginning from Jerusalem.
But you are witnesses of these things.
And behold, I am sending the promise of my Father upon you. But stay in the city of Jerusalem until you are clothed with power from on high.
And he led them out as far as Bethany, and lifting up his hands, he blessed them.
And while He was blessing them, He parted from them and was taken up into heaven.
And they worshiped Him and returned to Jerusalem with immense joy.
And they were continually in the temple, praising and blessing God. Amen.
In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.
He was in the beginning with God.
All things came into being through Him, and without Him not even one thing was made that has been made.
In Him was life, and that life was the light for humanity.
And the light shines in the darkness, and the darkness did not overpower it.
There came a man sent from God, whose name was John.
He came as a witness, to bear witness about the Light, so that all might believe through him.
He was not the light, but came to bear witness concerning the light.
The true light that gives light to everyone was coming into the world.
He was in the world, and though the world was made through him, the world did not recognize him.
He came to his own, and his own people did not receive him.
But to all who received him, he gave the authority to become children of God, to those who believe in his name.
who were not born of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God.
And the Word became flesh and dwelt among us, and we beheld His glory, the glory as of the only begotten from the Father, full of grace and truth.
John bore witness of Him and cried out, saying, 'This is He of whom I said, “He who comes after me has surpassed me, for He was before me.”'
And from His fullness we have all received, and grace upon grace.
For the law was given through Moses; grace and truth came into being through Jesus Christ.
No one has ever seen God; the only begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, He has declared Him.
And this is the testimony of John, when the Jews sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem to ask him, 'Who are you?'
And he confessed, and did not deny it; but he acknowledged, 'I am not the Christ.'
And they asked him, 'What then? Are you Elijah?' And he said, 'I am not.' 'Are you the Prophet?' And he answered, 'No.'
So they said to him, 'Who are you? Tell us, so that we can give an answer to those who sent us. What do you say about yourself?'
He said, 'I am the voice of one crying out in the wilderness, ‘Make straight the way of the Lord,’ as said by the prophet Isaiah.'
And those who were sent were from the Pharisees.
And they asked him, 'Then why are you baptizing, if you are neither the Christ, nor Elijah, nor the Prophet?'
John answered them, saying, 'I baptize with water; but there stands among you One whom you do not know.'
It is He who comes after me, who was before me; I am not worthy to untie the strap of His sandal.
These things took place in Bethany beyond the Jordan, where John was baptizing.
The next day, John saw Jesus coming toward him, and said, 'Look, the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world!'
This is he of whom I spoke: ‘A man comes after me who has surpassed me, for he existed before me.'
And I did not know Him, but for this reason I came baptizing with water, that He might be revealed to Israel.
And John bore witness, saying, 'I have seen the Spirit descending from heaven like a dove, and it remained on Him.'
And I did not know Him, but He who sent me to baptize with water said to me, 'Upon whom you see the Spirit descending and remaining on Him, this is He who baptizes with the Holy Spirit.'
And I have seen and have borne witness that this is the Son of God.
The next day, John was standing again with two of his disciples.
And he looked at Jesus as He walked by and said, "Behold, the Lamb of God!"
The two disciples heard him speaking, and they followed Jesus.
But Jesus turned and, seeing them following, said to them, 'What do you seek?'
He said to them, 'What are you seeking?' They said to Him, 'Rabbi (which means Teacher), where are you staying?'
He said to them, 'Come and see.' They went and saw where He was staying, and they remained with Him that day; it was about the tenth hour.
He first found his own brother Simon and said to him, 'We have found the Messiah' (which is translated, the Christ).
He found his own brother Simon and said to him, 'We have discovered the Messiah,' which is translated as 'the Christ.'
The next day, Jesus decided to go to Galilee. He found Philip and said to him, ‘Follow me.’
The following day, Jesus intended to go into Galilee, and He found Philip and said to him, ‘Come, be My disciple.’
Philip was from Bethsaida, the city of Andrew and Peter.
Philip found Nathanael and said to him, ‘We have found the one whom Moses wrote about in the Law, and whom the prophets also spoke, Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph.’
Jesus saw Nathanael approaching and said of him, ‘Behold, an Israelite indeed, in whom there is no deceit.’
Jesus saw Nathanael coming toward Him and said of him, 'Behold, an Israelite truly, in whom there is no guile.'
Nathanael replied to Him, "Rabbi, you are the Son of God! You are the King of Israel!"
Nathanael answered Him, 'Rabbi, you are the Son of God! You are the King of Israel!'
And Jesus answered him, 'Truly, I say to you, you will see heaven opened, and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of Man.'
On the third day, there was a wedding in Cana of Galilee, and the mother of Jesus was there.
And Jesus and His disciples were also invited to the wedding.
When the wine ran out, the mother of Jesus said to Him, 'They have no more wine.'
Jesus said to her, 'What is that to you and to me, woman? My hour has not yet come.'
His mother said to the servants, 'Whatever he tells you, do it.'
Now there were six stone water jars there for the Jewish rites of purification, each holding twenty or thirty gallons.
Jesus said to them, "Fill the jars with water." And they filled them to the brim.
And he said to them, 'Draw some out now and take it to the master of the feast.' And they brought it.
But when the head waiter tasted the water that had now become wine, and did not know where it had come from (though the servants who had drawn the water knew), he called the bridegroom.
And he said to him, "Every man serves the good wine first, and when people have drunk freely, then the inferior. But you have kept the good wine until now."
This, the first of His signs, Jesus performed at Cana in Galilee, and thus He manifested His glory; and His disciples believed in Him.
After this, He went down to Capernaum with His mother, His brothers, and His disciples; and they stayed there a few days.
The Passover of the Jews was approaching, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.
And He found in the temple those who were selling oxen, sheep, and doves, and the money changers sitting there.
And making a whip of cords, He drove them all out of the temple, both the sheep and the oxen; and He poured out the coins of the money changers and overturned their tables.
And to those who were selling the pigeons He said, 'Take these things away; do not make My Father’s house a house of trade.'
His disciples remembered that it is written, 'The zeal for Your house will consume me.'
So the Jews answered Him, 'What sign do You show us for doing these things?'
Jesus answered them, "Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up."
Then the Jews said, "This temple has been under construction for forty-six years, and will you raise it up in three days?"
But He was speaking of the temple of His body.
Therefore, when He was raised from the dead, His disciples remembered that He had said this, and they believed the Scripture and the word which Jesus had spoken.
Now when He was in Jerusalem at the Passover, during the feast, many believed in His name, observing the signs which He did.
But Jesus did not entrust Himself to them, because He knew all people.
and He did not need anyone to testify concerning man, for He Himself knew what was in man.
Now there was a man of the Pharisees, named Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews.
This man came to Jesus by night and said to Him, 'Rabbi, we know that You are a teacher come from God; for no one can perform the signs that You do unless God is with him.'
Jesus answered and said to him, "Truly, truly, I say to you, unless one is born again, he cannot see the Kingdom of God."
Nicodemus said to Him, "How can a man be born when he is old? Can he enter a second time into his mother’s womb and be born?"
Jesus answered, "Truly, truly, I say to you, unless one is born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter the kingdom of God."
That which is born of the flesh is flesh, and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit.
Do not marvel that I said to you, 'You must be born from above.'
The Spirit blows where it wishes, and you hear its sound, but you do not know where it comes from or where it goes. So it is with everyone who is born of the Spirit.
Nicodemus answered and said to Him, "How can these things be?"
Jesus answered and said to him, "You are the teacher of Israel, and you do not understand these things?"
Truly, truly, I say to you, we speak of what we know and bear witness to what we have seen, yet you do not accept our testimony.
If I have told you earthly things and you do not believe, how can you believe if I tell you heavenly things?
And no one has ascended into heaven except the one who descended from heaven, the Son of Man who is in heaven.
And just as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, so must the Son of Man be lifted up.
that whoever believes in Him may not be lost, but may have everlasting life.
For God so loved the world that He gave His one and only Son, that whoever believes in Him shall not perish but have eternal life.
For God did not send His Son into the world to condemn the world, but to save the world through Him.
Whoever believes in Him is not condemned; but whoever does not believe is already condemned, because he has not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God.
And this is the judgment: the light has come into the world, but people preferred darkness over light, because their deeds were evil.
For everyone who practices evil hates the light and does not come to the light, lest his works should be exposed.
But the one who practices the truth comes to the light, so that his works may be clearly seen, that they have been accomplished through God.
After this, Jesus and His disciples went into the Judean countryside, where He spent time with them and baptized.
John was also baptizing in Aenon near Salim, because there was plenty of water there; and people were coming and being baptized.
For John had not yet been cast into prison.
Now a discussion arose among John's disciples with a Jew concerning the matter of purification.
And they came to John and said to him, 'Rabbi, the one who was with you across the Jordan, whom you have testified about, behold, he is baptizing, and all are coming to him.'
John answered and said, 'A person cannot receive even one thing unless it is given him from heaven.'
You yourselves are witnesses that I said, ‘I am not the Christ, but I am the one sent before Him.’
The one who has the bride is the bridegroom; but the friend who stands and hears him rejoices greatly at the bridegroom’s voice. Therefore, this joy of mine is now complete.
He must increase, but I must decrease.
He who comes from above is above all; he who is of the earth belongs to the earth and speaks in an earthly way; he who comes from heaven is above all.
He bears witness to what he has seen and heard, yet no one receives his testimony.
The one who has accepted his testimony has certified that God is true.
For he whom God has sent speaks the words of God, for God gives the Spirit without measure.
The Father loves the Son and has entrusted everything into his hands.
Whoever believes in the Son has eternal life; but whoever disobeys the Son will not see life, but the wrath of God remains on him.
Now when Jesus learned that the Pharisees had heard that He was making and baptizing more disciples than John—
Although Jesus Himself was not baptizing, it was His disciples who carried out the baptisms.
He left Judea and went back once more to Galilee.
But he had to pass through Samaria.
So He came to a town of Samaria called Sychar, near the plot of ground that Jacob gave to his son Joseph.
Now Jacob's well was there. Jesus, therefore, tired from His journey, sat thus by the well. It was about the sixth hour.
A woman of Samaria came to draw water. Jesus said to her, "Give Me a drink."
For His disciples had gone into the city to buy food.
The Samaritan woman said to Him, 'How is it that you, a Jew, ask for a drink from me, a Samaritan woman?' For Jews have no dealings with Samaritans.
Jesus answered and said to her, 'If you knew the gift of God, and who it is that says to you, “Give Me a drink,” you would have asked Him, and He would have given you living water.'
The woman said to Him, 'Sir, You have no bucket, and the well is deep. Where then do You get that living water?'
Are You greater than our father Jacob, who gave us the well and drank from it himself, as did his sons and his livestock?
Jesus answered and said to her, "Everyone who drinks of this water will thirst again.
But whoever drinks of the water that I will give him shall never thirst again; rather, the water that I give him will become in him a well of water springing up to eternal life.
The woman said to Him, "Sir, give me this water, so that I will not thirst, nor come here to draw again."
Jesus said to her, 'Go, call your husband and come here.'
The woman answered him, 'I have no husband.' Jesus said to her, 'You are correct in saying, ‘I have no husband.’'
For you have had five husbands, and the man you now have is not your husband. What you have said is true.
The woman said to Him, 'Sir, I perceive that You are a prophet.'
Our fathers worshiped on this mountain, but you say that in Jerusalem is the place where people ought to worship.
Jesus said to her, 'Woman, believe Me, the time is coming when you will neither worship the Father on this mountain nor in Jerusalem.'
You worship what you do not know; we worship what we know, for salvation is from the Jews.
Yet the hour is coming, and now is here, when the true worshipers will worship the Father in spirit and in truth; for the Father seeks such people to be his worshipers.
God is spirit, and those who worship him must worship in spirit and truth.
The woman said to him, "I know that the Messiah is coming, the one called Christ. When he comes, he will declare all things to us."
Jesus said to her, "I who speak to you am he."
And at that moment, His disciples came, and they were amazed that He was speaking with a woman; yet no one said, "What do you seek?" or, "Why are you talking with her?"
So the woman left her water jar and went into the city, and she said to the people:
Come, see a man who told me everything I ever did. Could this be the Christ?
So they left the city and began their journey toward Him.
Meanwhile, the disciples urged Him, saying, "Rabbi, eat."
But He said to them, 'I have food to eat that you do not know about.'
Therefore, the disciples said to one another, 'Did someone bring Him food?'
Jesus said to them, 'My food is to do the will of Him who sent me and to finish His work.'
Do you not say, ‘There are still four months until the harvest’? Behold, I say to you, lift up your eyes and look at the fields, for they are already white for harvest.
And he who reaps receives wages and gathers fruit for eternal life, so that both he who sows and he who reaps may rejoice together.
For in this is the true saying, 'One sows and another reaps.'
I sent you to reap what you have not labored for; others have worked hard, and you have entered into their labor.
And many of the Samaritans from that city believed in him because of the woman's testimony, saying, "He told me everything I ever did."
So when the Samaritans came to him, they urged him to stay with them, and he stayed there for two days.
And many more believed because of His word.
And they said to the woman, "Now we believe, not because of what you said; for we ourselves have heard Him and we know that this is indeed the Savior of the world, the Christ."
After the two days, He departed from there and went to Galilee.
For Jesus Himself testified that a prophet has no honor in his own country.
So when He came to Galilee, the Galileans welcomed Him, having seen all the things He did in Jerusalem at the feast; for they also had gone to the feast.
So Jesus came again to Cana of Galilee, where He had made the water wine. And there was a certain royal official whose son was sick at Capernaum.
When this man heard that Jesus had come from Judea into Galilee, he went to Him and implored Him to come down and heal his son, for he was at the point of death.
Jesus said to him, "Unless you see signs and wonders, you will not believe."
The royal official said to him, "Sir, come down before my child dies."
Jesus replied, "Go; your son is alive." The man believed the word that Jesus spoke to him, and he departed.
As he was descending, his servants met him and reported, saying, 'Your son is alive!'
So he asked them at what hour he had begun to get better. They told him that yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him.
So the father knew that it was at that very hour when Jesus had said to him, 'Your son lives.' And he himself believed, along with his entire household.
This was the second miraculous sign that Jesus performed when He came from Judea into Galilee.
After this, there was a feast of the Jews, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.
Now in Jerusalem, near the Sheep Gate, there is a pool, which is called in Hebrew Bethesda, having five covered colonnades.
In these lay a multitude of the sick, blind, lame, and withered, waiting for the moving of the water.
For an angel would come down at certain times into the pool and stir the water; whoever stepped in first after the stirring of the water was made whole of whatever disease he had.
Now there was a certain man there who had been suffering from his ailment for thirty-eight years.
When Jesus saw him lying there and knew that he had already been in that condition for a long time, he said to him, "Do you want to be made whole?"
The sick man answered Him, "Sir, I have no one to put me into the pool when the water is stirred; but while I am coming, another steps down before me."
Jesus said to him, "Get up, take your mat and walk."
And immediately the man became well, and he took up his mat and walked. Now it was the Sabbath on that day.
So the Jews said to the man who had been healed, 'It is the Sabbath; it is not lawful for you to take up your bed.'
He answered them, 'The one who made me well said to me, ‘Take up your mat and walk.’'
They asked him, ‘Who is the man who told you, ‘Pick up your mat and walk’?’
But the man who had been healed did not know who it was, for Jesus had slipped away unnoticed in the crowd.
Afterward, Jesus found him in the temple and said to him, 'Look, you are well! Sin no more, lest a worse thing happen to you.'
The man went away and told the Jews that it was Jesus who had made him well.
And because of this, the Jews began to persecute Jesus and sought to kill Him, because He was doing these things on the Sabbath.
But Jesus answered them, 'My Father has been working until now, and I am working too.'
For this reason, the Jews were seeking all the more to kill Him, because He not only was breaking the Sabbath, but also was saying that God was His own Father, making Himself equal with God.
Jesus answered them, "Truly, truly, I say to you, the Son can do nothing by Himself, but only what He sees the Father doing; for whatever the Father does, that the Son does likewise."
For the Father loves the Son and shows Him all that He Himself is doing, and greater works than these will He show Him, so that you may marvel.
For just as the Father raises the dead and gives them life, so also the Son gives life to whom He wishes.
For the Father does not judge anyone, but has entrusted all judgment to the Son.
so that all may honor the Son just as they honor the Father. Whoever does not honor the Son does not honor the Father who sent Him.
Truly, truly, I say to you, whoever hears My word and believes in Him who sent Me has eternal life; he will not come into judgment, but has passed from death to life.
Truly, truly, I tell you, the hour is coming—and now is—when the dead will hear the voice of the Son of God, and those who hear will live.
For just as the Father has life in Himself, so He has granted the Son to have life in Himself.
And He has given Him authority to execute judgment, because He is the Son of Man.
Do not marvel at this; for an hour is coming when all who are in the graves will hear His voice.
And those who have done good will emerge to a resurrection of life, but those who have done evil will rise to a resurrection of judgment.
I cannot do anything on my own. I judge only as I hear, and my judgment is just because I do not seek my own will, but the will of him who sent me.
If I alone bear witness about myself, my testimony is not true.
There is another who bears witness about me, and I know that the testimony he gives concerning me is true.
You have sent to John, and he has borne witness to the truth.
But I do not receive testimony from man; rather, I say these things so that you may be saved.
He was a burning and shining lamp, and you were willing to rejoice for a while in his light.
But I have a testimony greater than that of John; for the works that the Father has given me to complete, the very works that I am doing, bear witness about me that the Father has sent me.
And the Father who sent me, He has testified about me. You have neither heard His voice at any time nor seen His form.
But you do not have His word abiding in you, because whom He sent, Him you do not believe.
You diligently search the Scriptures because you think that in them you have eternal life; yet they bear witness about Me.
Yet you are not willing to come to Me that you may have life.
I do not receive glory from men.
But I know you, that you do not have the love of God within yourselves.
I have come in my Father’s name, and you do not receive me; if another comes in his own name, him you will receive.
How can you believe when you accept glory from one another and do not seek the glory that comes from the only God?
Do not think that I will accuse you before the Father; there is one who accuses you—Moses, in whom you have placed your hope.
For if you believed Moses, you would believe Me; for he wrote of Me.
But if you do not believe his writings, how will you believe My words?
After these things, Jesus went away to the other side of the Sea of Galilee, which is also called the Sea of Tiberias.
And a great multitude followed Him, because they saw the signs which He performed on those who were sick.
Then Jesus went up into the mountain, and there He sat down with His disciples.
Now the Passover, the feast of the Jews, was near.
Then Jesus lifted up His eyes and saw that a large crowd was coming toward Him. He said to Philip, "Where shall we buy bread for these people to eat?"
This he said to test him, for he himself knew what he was about to do.
Philip answered Him, 'Two hundred denarii worth of bread would not be enough for each of them to receive even a little.'
One of His disciples, Andrew, the brother of Simon Peter, said to Him,
There is a boy here who has five barley loaves and two small fish; but what are they for so many?
Jesus said, 'Have the people sit down.' Now there was plenty of grass in that place, and so the men sat down, about five thousand in number.'
Jesus took the loaves, and having given thanks, distributed them to the disciples, and the disciples to those who were reclining; likewise also from the fish, as much as they desired.
And when they were filled, He said to His disciples, "Gather up the leftover pieces, so that nothing is wasted."
So they gathered them up and filled twelve baskets with the fragments from the five barley loaves that had been left over by those who had eaten.
When the people saw the sign that Jesus had performed, they exclaimed, 'Surely this is the Prophet who is to come into the world!'
Therefore, when Jesus realized that they were about to come and take Him by force to make Him king, He withdrew again to the mountain by Himself.
When evening came, His disciples went down to the sea.
And when they had boarded the boat, they set out across the sea toward Capernaum. Darkness had already fallen, and Jesus had not yet come to them.
The sea was stirred up because a great wind was blowing.
So when they had rowed about twenty-five or thirty stadia, they saw Jesus walking on the sea and drawing near to the boat, and they were terrified.
But He said to them, 'It is I; do not be afraid.'
So they were willing to take Him into the boat, and immediately the boat reached the shore to which they were heading.
The next day, the crowd that stood on the other side of the sea saw that there had been no other boat there except the one that His disciples had entered, and that Jesus had not gone with His disciples into the boat, but that His disciples had gone away alone.
However, other boats came from Tiberias, near the place where they had eaten the bread after the Lord had given thanks.
So when the crowd saw that Jesus was not there, nor His disciples, they got into boats and went to Capernaum, seeking Jesus.
And when they found Him on the other side of the sea, they said to Him, 'Rabbi, when did You come here?'
Jesus answered them and said, 'Truly, truly, I say to you, you seek Me, not because you saw signs, but because you ate of the loaves and were filled.'
Do not labor for the food that perishes, but for the food that endures to eternal life, which the Son of Man will give you; for on Him God the Father has set His seal.
Then they said to Him, "What must we do to be doing the works of God?"
Jesus answered them, "This is the work of God, that you believe in the one whom He has sent."
So they said to Him, 'What then do You do as a sign, so that we may see and believe You? What work do You perform?'
Our fathers ate the manna in the wilderness, as it is written, ‘He gave them bread from heaven to eat.’
Then Jesus said to them, ‘Truly, truly, I say to you, it was not Moses who gave you the bread from heaven, but my Father gives you the true bread from heaven.'
For the bread of God is he who comes down from heaven and gives life to the world.
Then they said to Him, 'Lord, always give us this bread.'
Then Jesus declared, 'I am the bread of life. Whoever comes to me will never go hungry, and whoever believes in me will never be thirsty.'
But I have told you that although you have seen me, you do not believe.
All that the Father gives me will come to me, and whoever comes to me I will never cast out.
For I have come down from heaven, not to do my own will, but the will of Him who sent me.
And this is the will of the Father who sent me: that I should lose none of all that He has given me, but raise them up on the last day.
For this is the will of my Father who sent me: that everyone who looks to the Son and believes in Him shall have eternal life, and I will raise him up at the last day.
Therefore, the Jews began to complain about Him because He said, 'I am the bread that came down from heaven.'
And they said, 'Isn't this Jesus, the son of Joseph, whose father and mother we know? How can he now say that he has come down from heaven?'
Jesus answered them, 'Do not murmur among yourselves.'
No one can come to me unless the Father who sent me draws him; and I will raise him up on the last day.
It is written in the prophets, ‘And they shall all be taught by God.’ Everyone who hears from the Father and learns comes to me.
Not that anyone has seen the Father, except he who is from God; he has seen the Father.
Truly, truly, I say to you, whoever believes in me has eternal life.
I am the bread of life.
Your forefathers ate the manna in the wilderness, and they died.
This is the bread that comes down from heaven, so that anyone who eats of it may not die.
I am the living bread that came down from heaven; if anyone eats of this bread, he will live forever. And the bread that I will give is my flesh, which I will give for the life of the world.
So the Jews began to argue among themselves, saying, "How can this man give us his flesh to eat?"
So Jesus said to them, "Truly, truly, I say to you, unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink His blood, you do not have life within yourselves."
Whoever eats my flesh and drinks my blood has eternal life, and I will raise him up on the last day.
For my flesh is truly food, and my blood is truly drink.
He who eats my flesh and drinks my blood abides in me, and I in him.
Just as the living Father sent me, and I live because of the Father, so whoever feeds on me will also live because of me.
This is the bread that came down from heaven; not like the bread that your forefathers ate and died. Whoever eats this bread will live forever.
He said these things while teaching in the synagogue at Capernaum.
Therefore, many of His disciples, upon hearing this, said, "This teaching is difficult; who can accept it?"
But Jesus, knowing in Himself that His disciples were complaining about this, said to them, 'Does this offend you?'
What if you were to see the Son of Man ascending to where He was before?
It is the Spirit who gives life; the flesh profits nothing. The words that I speak to you are spirit and they are life.
But there are some among you who do not believe. For Jesus knew from the beginning who they were who did not believe, and who it was that would betray Him.
And He said, "This is why I told you that no one can come to me unless it has been granted him by my Father."
From that time, many of His disciples turned back and no longer walked with Him.
Jesus then said to the twelve, "Are you also intending to leave?"
Simon Peter answered Him, "Lord, to whom shall we go? You have the words of eternal life."
And we have come to believe and to know that You are the Christ, the Son of the living God.
Jesus answered them, "Did I not choose you, the twelve? And yet one of you is a devil."
He spoke of Judas, son of Simon Iscariot; for he was about to betray Him, being one of the twelve.
After this, Jesus traveled through Galilee; He did not wish to walk in Judea, because the Jews sought to kill Him.
Now the Feast of Tabernacles was near, a festival of the Jews.
Therefore, His brothers said to Him, "Depart from here and go to Judea, that your disciples may see the works that you are doing."
For no one does anything in secret while seeking to be known publicly. If you are doing these things, show yourself to the world.
For even his own brothers did not believe in him.
Jesus said to them, "My time has not yet come, but your time is always ready."
The world cannot hate you, but it hates me because I testify about it that its deeds are evil.
You go up to this feast. I am not going up to this feast, because my time has not yet come.
After saying this to them, he stayed in Galilee.
But when his brothers had gone up to the feast, then he also went up, not openly, but as if in secret.
So the Jews were searching for him at the feast, and they were saying, 'Where is that man?'
And there was much murmuring about Him among the crowds. Some were saying, 'He is a good man'; others were saying, 'No, He deceives the people.'
Yet no one spoke openly about Him because of their fear of the Jews.
Now, in the midst of the feast, Jesus went up to the temple and began to teach.
And the Jews were astonished, saying, 'How does this man know letters, having never been educated?'
Jesus answered them, saying, 'My teaching is not my own, but comes from the One who sent me.'
If anyone is willing to do His will, he shall know concerning the teaching, whether it is from God or whether I speak on my own authority.
The one who speaks on his own authority seeks his own glory; but the one who seeks the glory of the one who sent him is true, and in him there is no injustice.
Did not Moses give you the Law? Yet none of you keeps the Law. Why are you seeking to kill me?
The crowd answered, 'You have a demon! Who is seeking to kill you?'
Jesus answered and said to them, 'I performed one work, and you all marvel at it for this reason.'
Moses gave you the rite of circumcision, not because it is from Moses, but from our ancestors; and you circumcise a man on the Sabbath.
If a man receives circumcision on the Sabbath so that the law of Moses may not be broken, are you angry with me because I made an entire man well on the Sabbath?
Do not judge according to appearance, but judge with righteous judgment.
Therefore some of the people of Jerusalem said, 'Is this not the man whom they seek to kill?'
But behold, he speaks with boldness, and they do not say anything to him. Could it be that the rulers indeed know that this one is truly the Christ?
But we know where this man comes from; when the Christ appears, no one will know where he comes from.
Then Jesus cried out in the temple, teaching and saying, "You both know me and know where I am from; and I have not come on my own authority, but He who sent me is true, whom you do not know."
But I know Him, for I am from Him, and He has sent me.
Therefore they sought to seize Him, but no one laid hands on Him, because His hour had not yet come.
But many of the crowd believed in Him and said, "When the Christ comes, will He perform more signs than this Man has done?"
The Pharisees heard the crowd whispering these things about Him, and the Pharisees and the chief priests sent officers to arrest Him.
Jesus therefore said, "I will be with you a little while longer, and then I will go to Him who sent Me."
You will seek Me, but you will not find Me; and where I am going, you cannot come.
Then the Jews said to one another, "Where is He planning to go that we will not find Him? Is He intending to go to the scattered among the Greeks and teach the Greeks?"
Who is this man about whom He said, ‘You will seek Me, but you will not find Me; and where I am going, you cannot come’?
On the last and greatest day of the feast, Jesus stood and cried out, saying, ‘If anyone thirsts, let him come to Me and drink.’
Whoever believes in Me, as the Scripture has said, out of his innermost being will flow rivers of living water.
He said this about the Spirit, whom those who believed in him were to receive; for the Spirit had not yet been given, because Jesus was not yet glorified.
Many in the crowd, having heard His words, declared, "This man is truly the Prophet."
Some said, "This is the Messiah." Others argued, "But does the Messiah come from Galilee?"
Is it not written in the Scriptures that the Christ comes from the seed of David and from the village of Bethlehem, where David was?
So there arose a division among the crowd because of Him.
Some of them wanted to seize Him, but no one laid hands on Him.
Then the officers came to the chief priests and Pharisees, who asked them, 'Why did you not bring Him?'
The officers answered, 'Never has a man spoken like this Man!'
The Pharisees then responded to them, 'Have you also been led astray?'
Has any of the rulers or the Pharisees believed in him?
But this crowd, which does not know the Law, is accursed!
Nicodemus, who had come to Him by night, said to them, 'Does our law judge a man before it hears him and knows what he is doing?'
Does our law condemn a man without first hearing from him and knowing what he has done?
They answered him, "Are you from Galilee as well? Search and see that no prophet arises from Galilee."
And each one went to his own house.
But Jesus went to the Mount of Olives.
But early in the morning, He came again to the temple, and all the people were coming to Him; and He sat down and taught them.
Then the scribes and Pharisees brought a woman caught in adultery, and they set her in the midst of the crowd.
They said to Him, 'Teacher, this woman has been caught in the act of adultery.'
Now in the Law, Moses commanded us to stone such women. What do You say?
But Jesus stooped down and wrote on the ground with His finger, as they continued to question Him. He raised His head and asked, "What do you say about this?".
When they continued to press Him, He stood up and said to them, "Let the one among you who is without sin be the first to throw a stone at her."
And again He bent down and wrote on the ground.
But when they heard His words, they began to leave one by one, starting with the oldest, and only Jesus was left, along with the woman who remained standing in the middle.
Jesus stood up and said to her, 'Woman, where are they? Has no one condemned you?'
She replied, 'No one, Lord.' And Jesus said, 'Neither do I condemn you; go, and from now on, sin no more.'
Again, Jesus spoke to them, saying, 'I am the light of the world. Whoever follows Me will never walk in darkness, but will have the light of life.'
Then the Pharisees said to Him, 'You bear witness about Yourself; Your testimony is not valid.'
Jesus answered and said to them, "Even if I testify about myself, my testimony is indeed valid, for I know where I came from and where I am going; but you do not know where I come from or where I am going."
You judge according to human standards; I do not judge anyone.
But if I do judge, my judgment is true, for I am not alone in it, but I and the Father who sent me.
In your Law it is written that the testimony of two men is valid.
I am the one who bears witness of myself, and the Father who sent me bears witness concerning me.
They said to Him, 'Where is your Father?' Jesus answered, 'You neither know Me nor My Father. If you had known Me, you would have known My Father also.'
These words Jesus spoke in the treasury, teaching in the temple; and no one seized Him, for His hour had not yet come.
So again Jesus said to them, 'I am going away, and you will search for me, but you will die in your sin. Where I am going, you cannot come.'
So the Jews said, 'Is He going to kill Himself because He says, 
And He said to them, 'You are from below; I am from above. You are of this world; I am not of this world.'
Therefore, I said to you that you will die in your sins; for unless you believe that I am He, you will die in your sins.
So they said to Him, 'Who are You?' And Jesus said to them, 'The beginning, just as I have been telling you from the start.'
I have much to say about you and to judge; but he who sent me is true, and I declare to the world what I have heard from him.
They did not understand that he was speaking to them about the Father.
So Jesus said to them, "When you have lifted up the Son of Man, then you will know that I am He, and that I do nothing on my own, but speak just as the Father taught me."
And He who sent me is with me; the Father has not left me alone, for I always do the things that are pleasing to Him.
As He spoke these things, many came to believe in Him.
So Jesus said to the Jews who had believed Him, "If you hold fast to My word, you are truly My disciples."
And you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free.
They answered Him, "We are descendants of Abraham and have never been enslaved to anyone. How can You say, ‘You will become free’?"
Jesus answered them, "Truly, truly, I say to you, everyone who commits sin is a slave to sin."
The slave does not remain in the house forever; the son remains forever.
So if the Son sets you free, you will truly be free.
I know that you are descendants of Abraham; but you seek to kill me because my word has no place within you.
I speak of what I have seen with my Father; so you do what you have seen with your father.
They answered him, "Our father is Abraham." Jesus said to them, "If you were truly children of Abraham, you would do the works of Abraham."
But now you seek to kill me, a man who has told you the truth that I heard from God; this Abraham did not do.
You are doing the works of your father.” They said to him, “We were not born of sexual immorality; we have one Father—even God.”
Jesus said to them, "If God were your Father, you would love me; for I came from God and now am here. I did not come of my own accord, but he sent me."
Why do you not understand my words? It is because you are unable to listen to my message.
You are of your father the devil, and you desire to do the will of your father. He was a murderer from the beginning and has never stood for the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaks, he speaks out of his own nature, for he is a liar and the father of lies.
But because I tell you the truth, you do not believe me.
Which of you can convict me of sin? If I speak the truth, why do you not believe me?
Whoever is of God hears the words of God; therefore, you do not hear them because you are not of God.
The Jews answered him, 'Aren’t we right in saying that you are a Samaritan and have a demon?'
Jesus answered, "I do not have a demon, but I honor my Father, and you dishonor me."
But I do not seek my own glory; there is One who seeks it and judges.
Truly, truly, I say to you, if anyone keeps my word, he will never see death.
So the Jews said to Him, 'Now we know that you are possessed by a demon. Abraham died, and the prophets as well, yet you say, if anyone keeps your word, he shall never taste death for all eternity.'
Are you greater than our father Abraham, who died? And the prophets died as well. Who do you make yourself out to be?
Jesus answered, "If I glorify myself, my glory is nothing; it is my Father who glorifies me, of whom you say, ‘He is our God.’"
But you have not known Him; I know Him. If I were to say that I do not know Him, I would be a liar like you, but I do know Him and keep His word.
Your father Abraham rejoiced at the thought of seeing My day; he saw it and was glad.
So the Jews said to Him, 'You are not yet fifty years old, and have You seen Abraham?'
Jesus said to them, 'Truly, truly, I say to you, before Abraham was born, I AM.'
So they picked up stones to throw at Him, but Jesus evaded them and went out of the temple, passing through their midst.
As Jesus was passing by, He saw a man who had been blind from birth.
And His disciples asked Him, saying, "Rabbi, who sinned, this man or his parents, that he was born blind?"
Jesus answered, "Neither this man nor his parents sinned, but this happened so that the works of God might be displayed in him."
I must work the works of Him who sent me while it is day; night is coming when no one can work.
As long as I am in the world, I am the light of the world.
Having said these things, He spat on the ground, made clay with the saliva, and anointed the blind man's eyes with the clay.
He said to him, "Go, wash in the Pool of Siloam," which is translated as 'Sent.' So he went and washed, and came back seeing.
Therefore, the neighbors and those who had seen him previously as a beggar said, "Is this not the man who used to sit and beg?"
Some said, "This is the man." Others said, "No, but he is like him." But he himself declared, "I am he."
So they asked him, 'How were your eyes opened?'
He answered, 'The man called Jesus made mud and anointed my eyes and told me, “Go to the pool of Siloam and wash.” So I went and washed, and I received my sight.'
They asked him, 'Where is the man who healed you?' He replied, 'I do not know.'
They brought him who had been blind to the Pharisees.
Now it was the Sabbath when Jesus made the clay and opened his eyes.
So the Pharisees again asked him how he had received his sight. He replied, 'He put mud on my eyes, and I washed, and now I see.'
Therefore, some of the Pharisees said, "This man is not from God, for he does not keep the Sabbath." But others said, "How can a man who is a sinner do such miraculous signs?" And there was division among them.
They said to the blind man again, "What do you say about him, since he opened your eyes?" He replied, "He is a prophet."
Therefore, the Jews did not believe concerning him that he had been blind and had received his sight, until they called the parents of the one who had received his sight.
And they asked them, saying, "Is this your son, whom you say was born blind? How then does he now see?"
His parents answered them, saying, 'We know that this is our son, and that he was born blind;'
But how he now sees, we do not know; or who opened his eyes, we do not know. He is of age; ask him, he will speak for himself.
His parents said these things because they were afraid of the Jewish leaders; for already the Jewish leaders had agreed that if anyone confessed him as the Christ, he would be put out of the synagogue.
Therefore, his parents said, ‘He is of age; ask him.’
So they called the man who had been blind a second time and said to him, 'Give glory to God; we know that this man is a sinner.'
He answered, 'Whether he is a sinner, I do not know; one thing I know: though I was blind, now I see.'
They said to him again, 'What did he do to you? How did he open your eyes?'
He answered them, 'I told you already, and you did not listen. Why do you want to hear it again? Do you also wish to become his disciples?'
They reviled him, saying, 'You are his disciple, but we are disciples of Moses.'
We know that God spoke to Moses; but as for this man, we do not know where he comes from.
The man answered and said to them, "This is truly remarkable: you do not know where He comes from, and yet He has opened my eyes."
We know that God does not listen to sinners, but if anyone is a worshiper of God and does His will, He hears them.
Since the world began, it has never been heard that anyone opened the eyes of a man born blind.
If this man were not from God, he could do nothing.
They answered and said to him, 'You were born entirely in sin, and are you teaching us?' And they cast him out.
Jesus heard that they had cast him out, and finding him, said, 'Do you believe in the Son of God?'
He answered and said, 'Who is he, Lord, that I may believe in him?'
Jesus said to him, 'You have both seen Him, and the one speaking with you is He.'
He said, 'Lord, I believe!' And he worshiped Him.
And Jesus said, 'For judgment I have come into this world, that those who do not see may see, and those who see may become blind.'
Some of the Pharisees who were with Him heard these things and said to Him, 'Are we also blind?'
Jesus said to them, "If you were blind, you would have no sin; but now that you say, 'We see,' your sin remains."
Truly, truly, I say to you, the one who does not enter the sheepfold by the door but climbs in another way, that person is a thief and a robber.
But the one who enters through the door is the shepherd of the sheep.
To this one, the doorkeeper opens; and the sheep hear his voice, and he calls his own sheep by name and leads them out.
And when he has brought out his own sheep, he goes before them, and the sheep follow him because they know his voice.
Yet they will never follow a stranger, but will flee from him, for they do not recognize the voice of strangers.
Jesus used this figure of speech, but they did not understand what he was telling them.
Therefore, Jesus said again, "Truly, truly, I say to you, I am the door of the sheep."
All who have come before me are thieves and robbers; but my sheep did not listen to them.
I am the door; if anyone enters through me, he will be saved, and will go in and out, and find pasture.
The thief comes only to steal, kill, and destroy. I have come that they may have life and have it abundantly.
I am the good shepherd. The good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep.
But the hired hand, who is not the shepherd, and to whom the sheep do not belong, sees the wolf coming and leaves the sheep and flees; and the wolf snatches them and scatters the flock.
The hired hand flees because he is only a hired hand and cares nothing for the sheep.
I am the good shepherd; I know my own, and my own know me.
Just as the Father knows me, and I know the Father, and I lay down my life for the sheep.
And I have other sheep that are not of this fold; I must bring them also, and they will listen to my voice. So there will be one flock, one shepherd.
For this reason, the Father loves me, because I lay down my life that I may take it up again.
No one takes it away from me, but I lay it down of my own accord. I have authority to lay it down, and I have authority to take it up again. This command I received from my Father.
Once again there was a division among the Jews because of these words.
Many among them declared, 'He is possessed by a demon and is raving mad; why do you listen to Him?'
Others said, 'These are not the words of one possessed by a demon. Can a demon open the eyes of the blind?'
Then came the Feast of Dedication in Jerusalem, and it was winter.
And Jesus was walking in the temple, in the colonnade of Solomon.
So the Jews gathered around him and said to him, 'How long will you keep us in suspense? If you are the Christ, tell us plainly.'
Jesus answered them, 'I told you, and you do not believe. The works that I do in my Father’s name bear witness about me.'
But you do not believe, because you do not belong to my sheep, as I said to you.
My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me.
And I give them eternal life, and they will never perish, and no one will snatch them out of my hand.
My Father, who has given them to me, is greater than all, and no one can snatch them out of my Father's hand.
I and the Father are one.
Then the Jews picked up stones again to throw at Him.
Jesus answered them, 'I have performed many good deeds before you from my Father. For which of these deeds are you attempting to stone Me?'
The Jews answered Him, saying, 'We are not stoning you for a good work, but for blasphemy, and because you, being a man, make yourself God.'
Jesus answered them, 'Is it not written in your law, 'I said, you are gods'?
If He called them gods to whom the word of God came, and Scripture cannot be broken,
Do you say of him whom the Father consecrated and sent into the world, 'You are blaspheming,' because I said, 'I am the Son of God'?}}
If I am not performing the works of my Father, do not believe me.
But if I do them, even if you do not believe me, believe the works, so that you may know and understand that the Father is in me, and I am in the Father.
So they sought again to seize him, but he escaped out of their grasp.
And he went away again across the Jordan, to the place where John had been baptizing at first, and there he stayed.
And many came to Him and said, 'John performed no miraculous sign, but everything that John said about this man was true.'
And many believed in Him there.
Now a certain man named Lazarus was ill; he was from Bethany, the village of Mary and her sister Martha.
Mary, who anointed the Lord with perfume and wiped His feet with her hair, was the sister of Lazarus, who was sick.
So the sisters sent word to Him, saying, 'Lord, behold, he whom You love is sick.'
When Jesus heard it, He said, "This sickness is not unto death, but for the glory of God, so that the Son of God may be glorified through it."
Now Jesus loved Martha and her sister and Lazarus.
So when He heard that he was ill, He stayed in the place where He was for two days.
Then after this, He said to His disciples, "Let us go back to Judea."
The disciples said to Him, "Rabbi, the Jews were just now seeking to stone You, and are You going there again?"
Jesus answered, "Are there not twelve hours in the day? If anyone walks during the day, he will not stumble, because he sees the light of this world."
But if anyone walks at night, he stumbles, because the light is not in him.
He said these things, and after that, He told them, 'Our friend Lazarus has fallen asleep, but I go to awaken him.'
The disciples said to Him, 'Lord, if he has fallen asleep, he will recover.'
Jesus had spoken of his death, but they thought that He meant he was taking rest in sleep.
Then Jesus told them plainly, "Lazarus has died."
And I rejoice on account of you, so that you may believe, for I was not there; but let us go to him.
Then Thomas, who is called the Twin, said to his fellow disciples, 'Let us also go, that we may die with him.'
When Jesus arrived, he found that Lazarus had already been in the tomb for four days.
Now Bethany was near Jerusalem, about fifteen stadia away.
And many of the Jews had come to Martha and Mary to offer them consolation concerning their brother.
So when Martha heard that Jesus was coming, she went out to meet Him; but Mary sat still in the house.
Martha then said to Jesus, "Lord, if You had been here, my brother would not have died."
But even now, I know that whatever you ask of God, God will grant you.
Jesus said to her, "Your brother will rise again."
Martha said to Him, "I know that he will rise again in the resurrection at the last day."
Jesus said to her, 'I am the resurrection and the life.'
And everyone who believes in me, even if he dies, will live; and everyone who is alive and believes in me shall never die. Do you believe this?
She said to Him, "Yes, Lord; I have come to believe that You are the Christ, the Son of God, who is coming into the world."
And having said this, she went away and secretly called her sister Mary, saying, "The Teacher is here and is calling for you."
As soon as she heard this, she got up quickly and went to Him.
But Jesus had not yet come into the village, but was still in the place where Martha met Him.
So the Jews who were with her in the house, comforting her, noticed that Mary had quickly risen and gone out. They followed her, saying, "She is going to the tomb to weep there."
When Mary arrived where Jesus was and saw him, she fell at his feet, saying to him, "Lord, if you had been here, my brother would not have died."
When Jesus saw her weeping, and the Jews who had come with her also weeping, he was deeply moved in spirit and troubled himself.
And He asked, 'Where have you laid him?' They replied, 'Lord, come and see.'
Jesus wept.
So the Jews said, "See how He loved him!"
But some of them said, 'Could not this man, who opened the eyes of the blind, have also kept this man from dying?'
Then Jesus, once more deeply moved within Himself, approached the tomb. It was a cave, and a stone was lying against it.
Jesus said, 'Remove the stone.' Martha, the sister of the deceased, said to Him, 'Lord, by this time there will be a stench, for he has been dead four days.'
Jesus said to her, 'Did I not tell you that if you believe, you will see the glory of God?'
So they took away the stone from the place where the dead man was lying. And Jesus lifted His eyes upward and said, 'Father, I thank You that You have heard Me.'
But I knew that You always hear Me; but because of the crowd standing here, I said this, so that they may believe that You sent Me.
And when He had said these things, He called out in a loud voice, 'Lazarus, come forth!'
And the dead man came out, his hands and feet still wrapped in grave clothes, and a cloth was around his face. Jesus said to them, 'Unbind him and let him go.'
Therefore, many of the Jews who had come to Mary and had seen what Jesus did believed in Him.
But some of them went to the Pharisees and told them what Jesus had done.
So the chief priests and the Pharisees gathered the Sanhedrin and said, 'What are we to do? This man is performing many signs.'
If we let him go on like this, everyone will believe in him, and the Romans will come and take away both our place and our nation.
But one of them, Caiaphas, who was high priest that year, said to them, 'You know nothing at all.'
You do not realize that it is better for us that one man should die for the people, rather than the whole nation be destroyed.
But he did not say this on his own; as high priest that year, he prophesied that Jesus was going to die for the nation.
And not for the nation only, but also to gather together in one the children of God who are scattered abroad.
From that day on, they plotted together to put Him to death.
Therefore, Jesus no longer walked openly among the Jews, but departed from there to a region near the wilderness, to a city called Ephraim, and there He stayed with His disciples.
Now the Passover of the Jews was near, and many went up to Jerusalem from the country before the Passover to purify themselves.
So they were seeking Jesus and were saying to one another in the temple, "What do you think? Will He not come to the feast?"
So the chief priests and the Pharisees had given a command that if anyone knew where He was, he should report it, so that they might seize Him.
Then Jesus came to Bethany six days before the Passover, where Lazarus was, the one who had died, whom He raised from the dead.
So they made Him a dinner there, and Martha served; but Lazarus was one of those who sat at the table with Him.
Then Mary took a pound of very costly perfume made from pure nard, anointed the feet of Jesus, and wiped His feet with her hair; and the house was filled with the fragrance of the perfume.
But one of His disciples, Judas Iscariot, son of Simon, who would later betray Him, said:
Why wasn’t this perfume sold for three hundred denarii and given to the poor?
He said this not because he cared about the poor, but because he was a thief; and having the money bag, he used to steal what was put into it.
Then Jesus said, "Leave her alone; she has kept this for the day of my burial."
For you will always have the poor among you, but you will not always have me.
Then a great crowd of Jews learned that he was there, and they came not only because of Jesus but also to see Lazarus, whom he had raised from the dead.
But the chief priests plotted to kill Lazarus as well,
because many of the Jews were going away and believing in Jesus because of him.
The next day, a large crowd that had come to the feast heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem.
They took palm branches and went out to meet him, and they cried out: 'Hosanna! Blessed is the one who comes in the name of the Lord, the King of Israel!'
Jesus found a young donkey and sat upon it, just as it is written.
Do not be afraid, Daughter of Zion; see, your King is coming, seated on a young donkey.
These things His disciples did not understand at first; but when Jesus was glorified, then they remembered that these things were written about Him, and that they had done these things to Him.
The crowd that had been with Him when He called Lazarus from the tomb and raised him from the dead continued to bear witness.
For this reason, the crowd went out to meet Him, because they heard that He had performed this miraculous sign.
Therefore, the Pharisees said to one another, "You see that you are gaining nothing. Look, the world has gone after Him."
Now there were some Greeks among those who went up to worship at the feast.
These approached Philip, who was from Bethsaida in Galilee, and asked him, saying, "Sir, we wish to see Jesus."
Philip came and told Andrew; Andrew and Philip went and said to Jesus.
But Jesus answered them, saying, 'The hour has come for the Son of Man to be glorified.'
Truly, truly, I say to you, unless a grain of wheat falls into the earth and dies, it remains alone; but if it dies, it bears much fruit.
The one who loves his life will lose it, but the one who hates his life in this world will keep it for eternal life.
If anyone serves Me, let him follow Me; and where I am, there My servant will be also. If anyone serves Me, the Father will honor him.
Now My soul is troubled, and what shall I say? Father, save Me from this hour? But for this very reason I came to this hour.
Father, glorify Your name.' Then a voice came from heaven, saying, 'I have glorified it, and I will glorify it again.'
The crowd that stood there and heard it said that it had thundered; others said, 'An angel spoke to Him.'
Jesus answered and said, 'This voice was not for My sake, but for your sake.'
Now is the judgment of this world; now the ruler of this world will be cast out.
And I, when I am lifted up from the earth, will draw all people to myself.
He said this to indicate the kind of death by which he was to die.
The crowd answered him, "We have heard from the Law that the Christ remains forever. How can you say that the Son of Man must be lifted up? Who is this Son of Man?"
Then Jesus said to them, "The light is with you a little longer; walk while you have the light, so that darkness does not overtake you. The one who walks in darkness does not know where he is going."
While you have the light, believe in the light, so that you may become children of light.' After saying this, Jesus withdrew and concealed Himself from them.
Despite all the miraculous signs He had performed in their presence, they still did not believe in Him.
So that the word of the prophet Isaiah might be fulfilled, which he said: "Lord, who has believed our report? And to whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed?"
For this reason, they were unable to believe, because again Isaiah said:
He has blinded their eyes and hardened their hearts, so that they would not see with their eyes, nor understand with their hearts, and turn, and I would heal them.
These things Isaiah said when he beheld His glory and spoke of Him.
Yet even among the rulers, many believed in Him, but because of the Pharisees they did not confess Him, so that they would not be expelled from the synagogue.
For they loved the glory that comes from men more than the glory that comes from God.
Jesus cried out and said, 'Whoever believes in me does not merely believe in me, but in the One who sent me.'
And the one who sees me sees the One who sent me.
I have come as a light into the world, that whoever believes in me may not remain in darkness.
And if anyone hears my words and does not believe, I do not judge him; for I did not come to judge the world, but to save the world.
The one who rejects me and does not receive my words has a judge; the very word that I have spoken will judge him on the last day.
For I have not spoken on my own authority, but the Father who sent me has given me a command: what I should say and what I should speak.
And I know that His command is eternal life. Therefore, the things I speak, I speak just as the Father has told me.
Now, before the Feast of Passover, Jesus, knowing that His hour had come to depart from this world to the Father, having loved His own who were in the world, He loved them to the end.
And during the meal, when the devil had already put it into the heart of Judas Iscariot, the son of Simon, to betray Him.
Knowing that the Father had given all things into His hands, and that He had come from God and was going to God,
He arose from the meal, laid aside His outer garments, and taking a towel, He wrapped it around Himself.
Then He poured water into a basin and began to wash the feet of the disciples, drying them with the towel with which He was girded.
He came to Simon Peter, who said to him, 'Lord, are you washing my feet?'
Jesus answered him, "What I am doing you do not understand now, but afterward you will know."
Peter said to Him, "You shall never wash my feet!" Jesus answered him, "If I do not wash you, you have no part with Me."
Simon Peter said to Him, 'Lord, not only my feet, but also my hands and my head!'
Jesus said to him, "He who has bathed needs only to wash his feet, but is completely clean; and you are clean, though not all of you."
For He knew the one who would betray Him; that is why He said, 'Not all of you are clean.'
So when He had washed their feet and put on His outer garments, He reclined again and said to them, 'Do you understand what I have done for you?'
You call me Teacher and Lord, and you speak rightly, for I am.
If I then, your Lord and Teacher, have washed your feet, you also ought to wash one another's feet.
For I have given you an example, that you should do as I have done to you.
Truly, truly, I say to you, a servant is not greater than his master, nor is an apostle greater than the one who sent him.
If you know these things, blessed are you if you do them.
I do not speak concerning all of you; I know whom I have chosen. But this is to fulfill the Scripture: 'He who eats bread with me has lifted his heel against me.'
From now on, I tell you before it happens, so that when it does happen, you may believe that I am.
Truly, truly, I say to you, whoever receives anyone I send receives me; and whoever receives me receives the one who sent me.
After saying this, Jesus was troubled in his spirit and testified, "Truly, truly, I say to you, one of you will betray me."
The disciples looked at one another, confused about whom He was talking about.
Now one of His disciples was reclining close to Jesus, the one whom Jesus loved.
So Simon Peter motioned to this disciple to ask Jesus of whom He was speaking.
So he leaned back against Jesus’ chest and asked Him, 'Lord, who is it?'
Jesus answered, 'It is the one to whom I shall give this piece of bread after I have dipped it.' And having dipped the piece of bread, He gave it to Judas Iscariot, the son of Simon.
And after the piece of bread, Satan entered into him. Jesus then said to him, 'What you are about to do, do it quickly.'
But no one at the table understood why He said this to him.
Some thought that because Judas had the money bag, Jesus was telling him to buy what we need for the feast, or to give something to the poor.
So, after receiving the piece of bread, he immediately went out. And it was night.
When he had gone out, Jesus said, "Now the Son of Man is glorified, and God is glorified in Him.
If God is glorified in Him, God will also glorify Him in Himself, and will glorify Him immediately.
Little children, I am with you only a little while longer. You will seek me, and just as I told the Jews, so I tell you now: where I am going, you cannot come.
A new command I give to you: that you love one another, just as I have loved you, you also are to love one another.
By this, all people will know that you are My disciples, if you have love for one another.
Simon Peter said to Him, 'Lord, where are You going?' Jesus answered him, 'Where I am going, you cannot follow now, but you will follow afterward.'
Peter said to Him, 'Lord, why can’t I follow You now? I will lay down my life for You.'
Jesus answered him, 'Will you lay down your life for me? Truly, truly, I say to you, the rooster will not crow until you have denied me three times.'
Let not your hearts be troubled. Trust in God; trust also in me.
In my Father's house, there are many rooms; if it were not so, I would have told you. I am going to prepare a place for you.
And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again and take you to myself, that where I am, you may also be.
And you know where I am going, and you know the way to get there.
Thomas said to Him, "Lord, we do not know where You are going, and how can we know the way?"
Jesus said to him, "I am the way, the truth, and the life; no one comes to the Father except through me."
If you had truly known me, you would have also known my Father. From now on, you know him and have seen him.
Philip said to him, "Lord, show us the Father, and it is enough for us."
Jesus said to him, "Have I been with you so long, and yet you do not know me, Philip? Whoever has seen me has seen the Father. How can you say, 'Show us the Father'?"
Do you not believe that I am in the Father and the Father is in me? The words that I speak to you, I do not speak on my own authority, but it is the Father who dwells in me, performing His works.
Believe me that I am in the Father and the Father is in me; but if you do not, believe because of the works themselves.
Truly, truly, I say to you, whoever believes in me will also do the works that I do; and greater works than these will he do, because I am going to the Father.
And whatever you ask in my name, that I will do, so that the Father may be glorified in the Son.
If you ask me anything in my name, I will do it.
If you love me, you will keep my commandments.
And I will ask the Father, and He will give you another Helper, that He may abide with you forever.
the Spirit of truth, whom the world cannot receive because it neither sees Him nor knows Him; but you know Him, for He dwells with you and will be in you.
I will not leave you as orphans; I am coming to you.
A little longer, and the world will no longer see me, but you will see me; because I live, you also will live.
In that day you will know that I am in my Father, and you in me, and I in you.
The one who has my commandments and keeps them, that person is the one who loves me. And the one who loves me will be loved by my Father, and I will love them and reveal myself to them.
Judas (not Iscariot) said to Him, "Lord, what has happened that you will reveal yourself to us and not to the world?"
Jesus answered and said to him, "If anyone loves me, he will keep my word, and my Father will love him, and we will come to him and make our dwelling with him."
The one who does not love me does not keep my words; and the message you hear is not mine, but belongs to the Father who sent me.
I have spoken these things to you while remaining with you.
But the Helper, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in my name, he will teach you all things and bring to your remembrance all that I have said to you.
Peace I leave with you; my peace I give to you. Not as the world gives do I give to you. Let not your hearts be troubled, neither let them be afraid.
You heard me say to you, ‘I am going away and will return to you.’ If you loved me, you would have rejoiced because I said, ‘I am going to the Father,’ for the Father is greater than I.
And now I have told you before it occurs, so that when it does happen, you may believe.
I will not talk with you much longer, for the ruler of this world is coming, and he has no hold on me.
But I do this so that the world may know that I love the Father, and as the Father commanded me, so I do. Rise, let us go from here.
I am the true vine, and my Father is the vinedresser.
Every branch in me that does not bear fruit, he takes away; and every branch that does bear fruit, he prunes, that it may bear more fruit.
You are already clean because of the word I have spoken to you.
Abide in me, and I in you. Just as the branch cannot bear fruit by itself unless it abides in the vine, neither can you bear fruit unless you abide in me.
I am the vine; you are the branches. The one who remains in me, and I in them, bears much fruit; for apart from me you can do nothing.
If anyone does not abide in me, he is thrown out like a withered branch and is gathered up and cast into the fire, where it is burned.
If you abide in Me, and My words abide in you, ask whatever you wish, and it will be done for you.
In this, my Father is glorified, that you bear much fruit and so prove to be my disciples.
Just as the Father has loved me, so I have loved you; abide in my love.
If you keep my commandments, you will abide in my love, just as I have kept my Father's commandments and abide in His love.
I have spoken these things to you so that my joy may remain in you and that your joy may be made complete.
This is my commandment, that you love one another just as I have loved you.
Greater love has no one than this, that someone lays down his life for his friends.
You are my friends if you do what I command you.
I no longer call you servants, for the servant does not know what his master is doing; instead, I have called you friends, for all that I have heard from my Father I have made known to you.
You did not choose me, but I chose you; and I appointed you to go and bear lasting fruit, so that whatever you ask the Father in my name, He may give you.
These things I command you, that you love one another.
If the world hates you, know that it has hated me before it hated you.
If you belonged to the world, it would love you as its own; but because you do not belong to the world, and I have chosen you out of the world, therefore the world hates you.
Remember the word that I spoke to you: 'A servant is not greater than his master.' If they persecuted me, they will also persecute you; if they kept my word, they will keep yours also.
But all these things they will do to you because of my name, for they do not know the one who sent me.
If I had not come and spoken to them, they would not be guilty of sin; but now they have no excuse for their sin.
Whoever hates me also hates my Father.
If I had not done among them the works that no one else did, they would not be guilty of sin; but now they have seen and hated both me and my Father.
But this is to fulfill the word that is written in their Law: ‘They hated Me without a cause.’
But when the Helper comes, whom I will send to you from the Father, the Spirit of truth who proceeds from the Father, He will bear witness about Me.
And you also will testify, because you have been with Me from the beginning.
These things I have spoken to you so that you would not be led astray.
They will expel you from the synagogues; indeed, the hour is coming when anyone who kills you will think they are offering service to God.
And they will do these things because they have not known the Father nor Me.
But I have spoken these things to you so that when the hour comes, you may remember them, that I told you. These things I did not say to you from the beginning, because I was with you.
But now I am going to Him who sent Me, and none of you asks Me, ‘Where are You going?’
But because I have spoken these things to you, your hearts have been filled with grief.
But truly, I tell you, it is for your benefit that I go away. For if I do not go away, the Helper will not come to you; but if I depart, I will send Him to you.
And when He comes, He will convict the world concerning sin, righteousness, and judgment.
about sin, because they do not believe in Me.
and concerning righteousness, because I am going to the Father, and you will see Me no more.
and concerning judgment, because the ruler of this world has been judged.
I still have many things to say to you, but you cannot bear them now.
But when that one comes, the Spirit of truth, he will guide you into all truth; for he will not speak from himself, but whatever he hears, that will he speak, and he will declare to you the things that are to come.
He will glorify me, for he will take what is mine and declare it to you.
All that the Father has is mine; therefore I said that He will take from what is mine and declare it to you.
A little while, and you will no longer see me; and again a little while, and you will see me, because I am going to the Father.
So some of his disciples said to one another, 'What does he mean by saying to us, “A little while, and you will not see me; and again a little while, and you will see me,” and, “Because I am going to the Father”?'
So they were saying, 'What does he mean by saying, “A little while”? We do not understand what he is talking about.'
Jesus knew they wanted to ask him about this, so he said to them, 'Are you discussing with one another what I meant when I said, “In a little while you will not see me, and then again in a little while you will see me”?'
Truly, truly, I say to you, you will weep and mourn, but the world will rejoice; you will be sad, but your sadness will turn into joy.
A woman, when she is in labor, experiences anguish because her time has come; but when she gives birth to the child, she no longer remembers the pain, for joy has come that a human being has been born into the world.
So now you indeed have sorrow, but I will see you again, and your hearts will rejoice, and your joy no one will take from you.
And in that day you will not ask Me anything. Truly, truly, I say to you, whatever you ask the Father in My name, He will give it to you.
Until now, you have not asked anything in My name. Ask, and you will receive, so that your joy may be complete.
These things I have spoken to you in figures of speech; but the time is coming when I will no longer speak to you in figures, but will tell you plainly about the Father.
In that day, you will ask in My name; and I do not say that I will ask the Father on your behalf.
For the Father himself loves you, because you have loved me and have believed that I came forth from God.
I came forth from the Father and have come into the world; again, I leave the world and go to the Father.
His disciples said, 'Now You are speaking plainly and not using a figure of speech.'
Now we know that You know all things and do not need anyone to question You. By this, we believe that You came forth from God.
Jesus answered them, "Now you believe."
Behold, the hour is coming, and indeed has come, when you will be scattered, each to your own place, and you will leave me alone; yet I am not alone, for the Father is with me.
I have spoken these things to you so that in me you may have peace. In the world you will have tribulation; but take heart, I have overcome the world.
These things Jesus spoke, and lifting His eyes to heaven, He said: 'Father, the time has come; glorify Your Son, that the Son may also glorify You.
As You have granted Him authority over all flesh, that He should give eternal life to all whom You have given Him.
And this is eternal life: that they may know You, the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom You have sent.
I have glorified You on earth by completing the work You gave Me to do.
And now, Father, glorify Me alongside Yourself with the glory that I had with You before the world existed.
I have manifested Your name to the people whom You gave Me out of the world. They were Yours, and You gave them to Me, and they have kept Your word.
Now they know that everything You have given to Me is from You;
For I have given them the words You gave Me, and they received them, and truly understood that I came forth from You, and they believed that You sent Me.
I ask on behalf of them; I do not ask on behalf of the world, but for those whom You have given Me, for they are Yours.
And all that is Mine is Yours, and all that is Yours is Mine; and I have been glorified in them.
And I am no longer in the world, but these are in the world, and I am coming to You. Holy Father, protect them by the power of Your name, the name You gave Me, so that they may be one, just as We are one.
While I was with them, I kept them in Your name. Those whom You gave Me I have preserved; none of them is lost except the son of perdition, so that the Scripture might be fulfilled.
But now I come to You, and these things I speak in the world so that they may have My joy fulfilled in them.
I have given them Your word; and the world has hated them because they are not of the world, just as I am not of the world.
I do not ask that You take them out of the world, but that You keep them safe from the evil one.
They are not of the world, just as I am not of the world.
Sanctify them in Your truth; Your word is truth.
As You sent Me into the world, I have sent them into the world.
And for their sake, I consecrate Myself, that they also may be sanctified in the truth.
I do not ask for these only, but also for those who will believe in Me through their word.
That they may all be one, just as You, Father, are in Me and I in You; that they also may be one in Us, so that the world may believe that You sent Me.
And I have given them the glory which You gave Me, that they may be one, just as We are one.
I in them, and You in Me, that they may be made complete in one, and that the world may know that You sent Me and have loved them even as You have loved Me.
Father, those whom You have given Me, I desire that they also, whom I will be with, may be where I am, to behold My glory which You have given Me, for You loved Me before the foundation of the world.
Righteous Father, although the world has not known You, I have known You; and these have come to know that You sent Me.
And I have made Your name known to them and will continue to make it known, so that the love with which You have loved Me may be in them, and I in them.
When Jesus had spoken these words, He went forth with His disciples across the Kidron Valley, where there was a garden, into which He and His disciples entered.
And Judas, who was betraying Him, knew the place, for Jesus had often met there with His disciples.
So Judas, having taken the detachment of soldiers and officers from the chief priests and Pharisees, came there with lanterns, torches, and weapons.
Jesus, knowing all that was about to happen to him, went forward and said to them, 'Whom do you seek?'
They answered him, 'Jesus of Nazareth.' Jesus said to them, 'I am.' And Judas, who was betraying him, stood with them.
When Jesus said to them, 'I am he,' they drew back and fell to the ground.
Again he asked them, 'Whom do you seek?' And they replied, 'Jesus of Nazareth.'
Jesus answered, 'I told you that I am He. Therefore, if you seek Me, let these go their way.'
This was to fulfill the word that He had spoken: ‘Of those whom You gave Me, I have lost not one.'
Then Simon Peter, having a sword, drew it and struck the servant of the high priest, cutting off his right ear; the servant's name was Malchus.
Jesus said to Peter, "Put your sword back into its sheath. Shall I not drink the cup that the Father has given me?"
So the cohort, along with the captain and the officers of the Jews, arrested Jesus and bound him.
And they led him first to Annas, for he was the father-in-law of Caiaphas, who was the high priest that year.
Caiaphas was the one who had advised the Jewish leaders that it was more advantageous for one man to die for the people.
Simon Peter followed Jesus, and so did another disciple. This disciple was known to the high priest, and he entered with Jesus into the courtyard of the high priest.
But Peter stood outside by the entrance. Then the other disciple, who was known to the high priest, went out and spoke to the doorkeeper and brought Peter in.
The servant girl who kept the door said to Peter, "You are not also one of this man's disciples, are you?" He said, "I am not."
Meanwhile, the servants and the officers had made a charcoal fire, because it was cold, and they were warming themselves. Peter was also with them, standing and warming himself.
The high priest then questioned Jesus about his disciples and about his teaching.
Jesus answered him, 'I spoke openly to the world. I always taught in synagogues and in the temple, where all the Jews come together; I have said nothing in secret.'
Why do you ask me? Ask those who heard me what I said to them; behold, they know what I said.
When He had said these things, one of the officers standing by gave a slap to Jesus, saying, "Is that how you answer the high priest?"
Jesus answered him, "If I have spoken wrongly, testify concerning the wrong; but if I have spoken rightly, why do you strike me?"
Annas then sent him bound to Caiaphas the high priest.
Now Simon Peter stood and warmed himself. They said to him, "Are you not also one of His disciples?" He denied it and said, "I am not."
But he denied it, saying, "I am not." One of the servants of the high priest, a relative of the one whose ear Peter had cut off, said to him, "Did I not see you in the garden with him?"
Again, Peter denied it, and immediately a rooster crowed.
Then they led Jesus from Caiaphas to the governor’s headquarters. It was early morning; and they themselves did not enter the governor’s headquarters, so that they would not be defiled, but could eat the Passover.
So Pilate went out to them and said, 'What accusation do you bring against this man?'
They answered him, 'If this man were not a wrongdoer, we would not have delivered him over to you.'
Then Pilate said to them, 'Take him yourselves and judge him by your own law.' The Jews replied to him, 'It is not lawful for us to put anyone to death.'
This was to fulfill the word that Jesus had spoken, signifying by what kind of death he was going to die.
Pilate then entered the praetorium again, called for Jesus, and said to Him, 'Are You the King of the Jews?'
Jesus answered him, 'Are you saying this on your own, or have others told you about Me?'
Pilate replied, 'Am I a Jew? Your own nation and the chief priests have delivered You to me. What have You done?'
Jesus answered, 'My kingdom is not of this world; if My kingdom were of this world, My servants would fight, so that I should not be delivered to the Jews. But now My kingdom is not from here.'
Therefore Pilate said to Him, 'So you are a king?' Jesus answered, 'You say that I am a king. For this purpose I was born, and for this purpose I have come into the world, to bear witness to the truth. Everyone who is of the truth hears My voice.'
Pilate said to Him, 'What is truth?' And having said this, he went out again to the Jews and told them, 'I find no fault in Him.'
But it is your custom that I release one prisoner to you at Passover. Therefore, do you want me to release to you the King of the Jews?
So they all shouted again, saying, "Not this man, but Barabbas!" Now Barabbas was a robber.
Then Pilate took Jesus and had Him scourged.
And the soldiers, weaving a crown of thorns, placed it upon His head, and arrayed Him in a purple garment.
And they kept saying, 'Hail, King of the Jews!' and they struck Him with their hands.
Then Pilate went out again and said to them, 'Behold, I am bringing Him out to you, so that you may know that I find no fault in Him.'
Then Jesus came out wearing the crown of thorns and the purple robe. And Pilate said to them, 'Behold the Man!'
When the chief priests and officers saw Him, they cried out, saying, 'Crucify Him! Crucify Him!' Pilate said to them, 'You take Him and crucify Him, for I find no fault in Him.'
The Jews answered him, 'We have a law, and according to our law, He ought to die because He made Himself the Son of God.'
When Pilate heard this statement, he became even more afraid.
And he entered the Praetorium again and said to Jesus, "Where are You from?" But Jesus gave him no answer.
Pilate said to Him, "Are You not speaking to me? Do You not know that I have the power to crucify You and the power to release You?"
Jesus answered, "You would have no authority over Me at all unless it had been given to you from above. Therefore, the one who has delivered Me to you has the greater sin."
From then on, Pilate sought to release Him; but the Jews cried out, saying, "If you let this Man go, you are not Caesar's friend. Whoever makes himself a king speaks against Caesar."
When Pilate heard these words, he brought Jesus out and sat down on the judgment seat at a place called Lithostratos, which in Hebrew is called Gabbatha.
Now it was the day of preparation for the Passover, about the sixth hour. He said to the Jews, "Behold, your King!"
But they shouted, 'Away with Him! Away with Him! Crucify Him!' Pilate said to them, 'Shall I crucify your King?' The chief priests answered, 'We have no king but Caesar.'
Then Pilate handed Him over to them to be crucified.
So they took Jesus, and He went out, bearing His cross to the place called The Skull, which is called in Hebrew, Golgotha.
There they crucified Him, and with Him were two others, one on either side, and Jesus in the middle.
Pilate also wrote a title and put it on the cross. It was written: "Jesus of Nazareth, the King of the Jews."
Therefore, this title was read by many of the Jews, for the place where Jesus was crucified was near the city; and it was written in Hebrew, Greek, and Latin.
Therefore the chief priests of the Jews said to Pilate, "Do not write, 'The King of the Jews,' but rather, 'This man said, I am the King of the Jews.'"
Pilate answered, "What I have written, I have written."
Then the soldiers, when they had crucified Jesus, took His garments and made four parts, to each soldier a part, and also the tunic; now the tunic was seamless, woven in one piece from the top.
So they said to one another, 'Let us not tear it, but cast lots for it to see whose it will be,' so that the scripture might be fulfilled which says: 'They divided my garments among themselves, and for my clothing, they cast lots.'
So the soldiers did these things. But standing near the cross of Jesus were his mother, and his mother’s sister, Mary the wife of Clopas, and Mary Magdalene.
When Jesus saw his mother and the disciple whom he loved standing nearby, he said to her, "Woman, behold your son!"
Then he said to the disciple, 'Behold, your mother!' And from that hour, the disciple took her into his own home.
After this, knowing that all things were now accomplished, that the Scripture might be fulfilled, Jesus said, 'I thirst.'
Now a jar full of sour wine was sitting there; so they put a sponge soaked in the sour wine on a branch of hyssop and held it up to His mouth.
When Jesus had received the sour wine, He said, 'It is finished!' And bowing His head, He gave up His spirit.
Therefore, the Jews, because it was the day of Preparation, so that the bodies would not remain on the cross during the Sabbath (for that Sabbath was a high day), asked Pilate to have their legs broken and that they might be taken away.
So the soldiers came, and they broke the legs of the first man who was crucified with Jesus, and then they broke the legs of the other man who was crucified alongside Him.
But when they came to Jesus and saw that He was already dead, they did not break His legs.
But one of the soldiers pierced His side with a spear, and immediately there came out blood and water.
And he who saw it has borne witness, and his testimony is true; and he knows that he is telling the truth, so that you may also believe.
For these things occurred so that the Scripture would be fulfilled: 'Not one of his bones shall be broken.'
And again another scripture says: 'They will look upon the one whom they have pierced.'
After these things, Joseph of Arimathea, who was a disciple of Jesus but secretly for fear of the Jews, asked Pilate that he might take away the body of Jesus; and Pilate gave him permission. So he came and took the body of Jesus.
Nicodemus also came, the one who had gone to Jesus before by night, bringing a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about a hundred pounds.
So they took the body of Jesus and bound it in linen cloths with the spices, as is the custom among the Jews for burial.
Now in the place where He was crucified there was a garden, and in the garden a new tomb, in which no one had yet been laid.
So they placed Jesus there because of the Jewish preparation day, for the tomb was nearby.
On the first day of the week, Mary Magdalene came early, while it was still dark, to the tomb, and she saw that the stone had been taken away from the tomb.
So she ran and went to Simon Peter and to the other disciple, the one whom Jesus loved, and said to them, ‘They have taken the Lord out of the tomb, and we do not know where they have laid Him.’
Then Peter went out, along with the other disciple, and they headed towards the tomb.
The two disciples ran together, but the other disciple outran Peter and reached the tomb first.
And he bent down to look in and saw the linen cloths lying there, yet he did not go in.
Then Simon Peter came, following him, and went into the tomb; he saw the linen cloths lying there.
and the napkin that had been on His head was not lying with the linen cloths, but was folded up in a separate place.
Then the other disciple, who had come first to the tomb, entered as well; and he saw and believed.
For they had not yet understood the Scripture that he must rise from the dead.
So the disciples went back to their own places.
But Mary stood outside the tomb, weeping.
And as she wept, she stooped down to look into the tomb, and she saw two angels in white sitting, one at the head and the other at the feet, where the body of Jesus had been laid.
And they said to her, "Woman, why are you weeping?" She said to them, "Because they have taken away my Lord, and I do not know where they have laid Him."
Having said this, she turned around and saw Jesus standing there, but she did not recognize that it was Jesus.
Jesus said to her, 'Woman, why are you weeping? Whom are you seeking?' She, thinking Him to be the gardener, said to Him, 'Sir, if you have carried Him away, tell me where you have laid Him, and I will take Him away.'
Jesus said to her, 'Mary.' Turning around, she said to Him, 'Rabboni!' (which means Teacher).
Jesus said to her, 'Do not hold on to me, for I have not yet ascended to my Father. But go to my brothers and tell them, ‘I am ascending to my Father and your Father, to my God and your God.’
Mary Magdalene came announcing to the disciples, ‘I have seen the Lord!’ And she told them the things he had said to her.
On the evening of that day, the first day of the week, when the doors were locked where the disciples were gathered for fear of the Jews, Jesus came and stood among them and said to them, ‘Peace be with you.’
And having said this, He showed them His hands and His side. The disciples rejoiced at seeing the Lord.
Then Jesus said to them again, "Peace be with you. Just as the Father has sent Me, I am sending you."
And when He had said this, He breathed on them and said, 'Receive the Holy Spirit.'
If you forgive anyone's sins, they are forgiven; if you retain anyone's sins, they are retained.
Now Thomas, one of the twelve, called the Twin, was not with them when Jesus came.
So the other disciples told him, "We have seen the Lord!" But he said to them, "Unless I see the marks of the nails in his hands and put my finger into the nail marks and put my hand into his side, I will not believe."
Eight days later, His disciples were again gathered inside, and Thomas was with them. Jesus came, though the doors were locked, and stood in the midst, and said, 'Peace be with you.'
Then He said to Thomas, 'Put your finger here and see My hands; and put your hand here and place it in My side. Do not be faithless, but believe.'
Thomas responded to Him, "My Lord and my God!"
Jesus said to him, "Because you have seen Me, you have believed. Blessed are those who have not seen and yet have believed."
Therefore, Jesus also performed many other signs in the presence of His disciples, which are not written in this book.
But these things are written so that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that by believing, you may have life in His name.
After these things, Jesus revealed Himself again to the disciples at the Sea of Tiberias; and He revealed Himself in this way.
Simon Peter, Thomas (called the Twin), Nathanael from Cana in Galilee, the sons of Zebedee, and two others of His disciples were together.
Simon Peter said to them, "I am going fishing." They said to him, "We will go with you." They went out and immediately got into the boat, and that night they caught nothing.
But when morning had now come, Jesus stood on the shore; yet the disciples did not know that it was Jesus.
Then Jesus said to them, "Children, do you have any fish?" They answered Him, "No."
He said to them, 'Cast your net on the right side of the boat, and you will find some.' So they cast it, and now they were not able to haul it in because of the multitude of fish.
Then that disciple, whom Jesus loved, said to Peter, 'It is the Lord!' As soon as Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord, he wrapped his outer garment around him (for he had taken it off) and jumped into the sea.
The other disciples came in the boat, for they were not far from land, but about two hundred cubits away, dragging the net full of fish.
When they had stepped onto the land, they saw a charcoal fire set up there, with fish laid upon it and bread.
Jesus said to them, 'Bring some of the fish that you have just caught.'
Simon Peter went up and drew the net to land, full of large fish, one hundred fifty-three; and although there were so many, the net was not broken.
Jesus said to them, "Come and eat breakfast." None of the disciples dared to ask him, "Who are you?" They knew it was the Lord.
Jesus came and took the bread, and gave it to them; and likewise the fish.
This was now the third time that Jesus revealed himself to his disciples after he had risen from the dead.
When they had finished eating, Jesus said to Simon Peter, 'Simon son of John, do you love me more than these?' He replied, 'Yes, Lord; you know that I have affection for you.' Jesus said to him, 'Feed my lambs.'
He said to him a second time, 'Simon son of John, do you love me?' Peter answered, 'Yes, Lord; you know that I hold deep affection for you.' Jesus said to him, 'Tend my sheep.'
He said to him the third time, 'Simon, son of John, do you love me?' Peter was grieved because He asked him the third time, 'Do you love me?' And he said to Him, 'Lord, you know all things; you know that I love you.' Jesus said to him, 'Feed my sheep.'
Truly, truly, I say to you, when you were younger, you used to dress yourself and walk wherever you wished; but when you grow old, you will stretch out your hands, and another will gird you and carry you where you do not wish to go.
This he said, signifying by what kind of death he would glorify God. And after saying this, he said to him, "Follow me."
Turning around, Peter saw the disciple whom Jesus loved following them, the one who had leaned back against Jesus at the dinner and had said, 'Lord, who is it that is going to betray you?'
When Peter saw him, he said to Jesus, 'Lord, what about this man?'
Jesus said to him, "If I want him to remain until I come, what is that to you? You follow me!"
Therefore, this saying spread among the brothers that this disciple would not die; yet Jesus did not say to him that he would not die, but, 'If I desire him to remain until I come, what is that to you?'
This is the disciple who testifies about these things and has written them down. We know that his testimony is true.
And there are also many other things that Jesus did, which if they were to be written one by one, I suppose that even the world itself could not contain the books that would be written. Amen.
In my first account, I addressed you, O Theophilus, about all that Jesus began both to do and to teach.
until the day when He was taken up, after He had given commands to the apostles whom He had chosen through the Holy Spirit.
To them, he also presented himself alive after his suffering, with many convincing proofs, appearing to them over the course of forty days and speaking about the things concerning the kingdom of God.
And while he was together with them, he commanded them not to depart from Jerusalem, but to wait for the promise of the Father, which you have heard from me.
For John truly baptized with water, but you shall be baptized with the Holy Spirit not many days from now.
So when they had come together, they asked Him, saying, "Lord, is this the time when You will restore the kingdom to Israel?"
He said to them, 'It is not for you to know the times or seasons that the Father has fixed by His own authority.'
But you will receive power when the Holy Spirit comes upon you, and you will be my witnesses in Jerusalem and in all Judea and Samaria, and to the ends of the earth.
After he said these things, as they were watching, he was lifted up, and a cloud took him out of their sight.
As they were intently watching him ascend into heaven, suddenly two men appeared beside them dressed in white robes.
They said, "Men of Galilee, why do you stand looking up into the sky? This Jesus, who has been taken up from you into heaven, will come in the same way you saw him go into heaven."
Then they returned to Jerusalem from the Mount called Olivet, which is near Jerusalem, a Sabbath day's journey away.
And when they entered, they went up to the upper room where they were staying: Peter and John, James and Andrew, Philip and Thomas, Bartholomew and Matthew, James the son of Alphaeus, Simon the Zealot, and Judas the son of James.
All these were continually devoting themselves with one accord to prayer, along with the women and Mary the mother of Jesus, and with His brothers.
In those days, Peter stood up in the midst of the disciples and said, "The number of names was about one hundred twenty."
Men, brothers, it was necessary for the Scripture to be fulfilled, which the Holy Spirit spoke beforehand through the mouth of David concerning Judas, who became a guide to those who arrested Jesus.
For he was numbered with us and received a share in this ministry.
Now this man acquired a field with the wages of his wrongdoing, and falling headlong, he burst open in the middle, and all his bowels gushed out.
And it became known to all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, so much so that the place was called in their own language Akeldama, that is, the Field of Blood.
For it is written in the book of Psalms: ‘Let his dwelling place be desolate, and let there be no one to inhabit it’; and ‘Let another take his office.’
Therefore, it is essential that one of the men who have accompanied us during the whole time the Lord Jesus went in and out among us be chosen.
beginning from the baptism of John until the day He was taken up from us, one of these must become a witness with us of His resurrection.
And they appointed two: Joseph called Barsabbas, who was also known as Justus, and Matthias.
And after praying, they said, 'You, Lord, who know the hearts of all, show us which of these two you have chosen.'
to take the place in this ministry and apostleship from which Judas turned away to go to his own place.
And they cast lots for them, and the lot fell on Matthias; and he was numbered with the eleven apostles.
When the day of Pentecost had fully come, they were all together in one place, in complete harmony.
And suddenly there came a sound from heaven, as of a rushing mighty wind, and it filled the whole house where they were sitting.
And there appeared to them divided tongues as of fire, and one sat upon each of them.
And all were filled with the Holy Spirit, and began to speak in different tongues as the Spirit gave them utterance.
Now there were dwelling in Jerusalem Jews, devout men from every nation under heaven.
When this sound occurred, the multitude came together and were bewildered, because each one heard them speaking in his own language.
And all were astonished and wondered, saying to one another, 'Are not all these who are speaking Galileans?'
And how is it that we each hear them speaking in our own native dialect?
Parthians, Medes, and Elamites, and those dwelling in Mesopotamia, Judea and Cappadocia, Pontus and Asia,
Phrygia and Pamphylia, Egypt and the parts of Libya around Cyrene, and visitors from Rome, both Jews and proselytes,
Cretans and Arabs, we hear them speaking in our own languages the wonderful works of God.
And all were astounded and perplexed, saying to one another, 'What could this mean?'
But others, mocking, said, 'They are filled with sweet wine.'
But Peter, standing with the eleven, lifted up his voice and addressed them, 'Men of Judea and all who dwell in Jerusalem, let this be known to you, and give ear to my words.
For these men are not drunk, as you suppose; for it is only the third hour of the day.
But this is what was spoken through the prophet Joel:
‘And it shall be in the last days,’ says God, ‘that I will pour out my Spirit upon all humanity; and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, your young men shall see visions, and your old men shall dream dreams.
And even upon my servants, both men and women, I will pour out my Spirit in those days; and they shall prophesy.
And I will grant wonders in the sky above and signs on the earth below, blood and fire and a cloud of smoke.
The sun will be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood, before the great and glorious day of the Lord arrives.
And it shall come to pass that everyone who calls on the name of the Lord shall be saved.
Men of Israel, listen to these words: Jesus of Nazareth, a man attested to you by God with mighty works and wonders and signs that God did through him in your midst, as you yourselves know.
This Jesus, delivered up according to the predetermined plan and foreknowledge of God, you crucified and killed by the hands of lawless men.
Whom God raised up, freeing Him from the pains of death, because it was not possible for Him to be held by it.
For David says concerning Him: ‘I constantly keep the Lord before me; for He is at my right hand, that I may not be shaken.'
Therefore my heart was filled with joy, and my tongue exclaimed in praise; moreover, my flesh will dwell in hope.
For You will not abandon my soul to the realm of the dead, nor will You allow Your Holy One to experience corruption.
You have made known to me the ways of life; You will fill me with joy in Your presence.
Brothers, I confidently say to you regarding the patriarch David that he both died and was buried, and his tomb is with us to this day.
Therefore, being a prophet and knowing that God had sworn an oath to him, that from the fruit of his own body he would raise up Christ to sit on his throne according to the flesh,
Foreseeing this, he spoke about the resurrection of the Christ, that His soul was not abandoned to Hades, nor did His flesh experience decay.
This Jesus God has raised up, of which we all are witnesses.
Therefore, having been exalted to the right hand of God and having received from the Father the promised Holy Spirit, He has poured out this which you now see and hear.
For David did not ascend into the heavens, but he himself says: 'The Lord said to my Lord, sit at My right hand.'
until I place your enemies as a footrest for your feet.
Therefore, let all the house of Israel know for certain that God has made this Jesus, whom you crucified, both Lord and Christ.
Upon hearing this, they were deeply pierced in their hearts and said to Peter and the rest of the apostles, 'Brothers, what should we do?'
Peter replied, 'Repent, and let each of you be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins, and you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.'
For the promise is for you and your children, and for all who are far off, as many as the Lord our God will call to Himself.
And with many other words he earnestly testified and urged them, saying, 'Save yourselves from this crooked generation.'
So those who joyfully accepted his message were baptized, and on that day about three thousand souls were added.
They devoted themselves to the apostles' teaching, to the fellowship, to the breaking of bread, and to the prayers.
Awe came upon every soul, and many wonders and signs were performed through the apostles.
And all the believers were united and shared everything they had.
They sold their property and possessions and distributed the proceeds to anyone in need.
Every day, they continued to meet together in the temple courts and broke bread in their homes, sharing meals with glad and sincere hearts.
Praising God and enjoying the goodwill of all the people. And the Lord added to their number daily those who were being saved.
Now Peter and John went up together to the temple at the hour of prayer, the ninth hour.
And a certain man, who had been lame from his mother’s womb, was being carried and laid daily at the gate of the temple, called Beautiful, to ask for alms from those entering the temple.
When he saw Peter and John about to enter the temple, he asked them for money.
But Peter, along with John, gazing intently at him, said, "Look at us."
But he gave them his full attention, expecting to receive something from them.
But Peter said, 'Silver and gold I do not have; but what I do have I give you. In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, rise up and walk.'
And taking him by the right hand, he lifted him up; and immediately his feet and ankle bones received strength.
And leaping up, he stood and walked, and entered with them into the temple, walking and leaping and praising God.
And all the people saw him walking and praising God.
And they recognized him as the man who used to sit by the Beautiful Gate of the temple, asking for alms; and they were filled with amazement and wonder at what had happened to him.
And while the healed man clung to Peter and John, all the people ran together to them in the place called Solomon's Porch, astonished.
When Peter saw this, he addressed the people: 'Men of Israel, why are you amazed at this? Or why do you stare at us as if by our own power or piety we had made this man walk?'
The God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, the God of our fathers, has glorified His servant Jesus, whom you delivered up and denied in the presence of Pilate, when he was determined to release Him.
But you denied the Holy One and the Just, and asked for a murderer to be granted to you.
And you killed the Author of life, whom God raised from the dead, of which we are witnesses.
And by faith in His name, this man whom you see and know has been made strong; it is the faith that comes through Him that has given him this complete healing in your presence.
And now, brothers, I know that you acted in ignorance, just as your rulers did.
But God, as He foretold through the mouth of all His prophets, has fulfilled that Christ should suffer in this way.
Therefore, repent and return to God, so that your sins may be wiped away.
That times of refreshing may come from the presence of the Lord, and that He may send you the appointed Christ, Jesus.
Heaven must receive him until the time of the restoration of all things, as God spoke through the mouth of all His holy prophets since the world began.
For Moses said to the fathers, ‘The Lord your God will raise up for you a prophet like me from among your brethren. Him you shall hear in all things that He speaks to you.'
And it shall be that every soul who does not listen to that Prophet shall be utterly destroyed from among the people.
Indeed, all the prophets from Samuel and those who came after him have spoken, announcing these days.
You are the sons of the prophets and of the covenant which God made with our fathers, saying to Abraham, ‘And in your seed all the families of the earth shall be blessed.’
For you first, God raised up His Servant Jesus and sent Him to bless you by turning each of you from your wickedness.
While they were speaking to the people, the priests and the captain of the temple, along with the Sadducees, confronted them.
They were greatly troubled because they were teaching the people and proclaiming in Jesus the resurrection of the dead.
And they laid hands on them and put them in custody until the next day, for it was already evening.
But many of those who heard the word believed, and the number of men came to be about five thousand.
And it came to pass on the next day that their rulers, elders, and scribes were gathered together in Jerusalem.
And Annas, the high priest, along with Caiaphas, John, Alexander, and all who were of the high-priestly descent, gathered together.
And when they had placed them in the center, they began to inquire, "By what power or in what name have you done this?"
Then Peter, filled with the Holy Spirit, said to them, 'Rulers of the people and elders of Israel,'
If we are being examined today concerning a good deed done to a sick man, by what means this man has been healed,
Let it be known to all of you and to all the people of Israel that by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom you crucified, whom God raised from the dead, by Him this man stands before you whole.
This is the stone that was despised by you builders, which has become the cornerstone.
And there is no salvation in any other; for there is no other name under heaven given among men by which we must be saved.
When they observed the boldness of Peter and John, and realized that they were uneducated men and commoners, they were amazed and recognized that they had been with Jesus.
And seeing the man who had been healed standing with them, they had nothing to say in reply.
So they commanded them to go out of the council, and they conferred among themselves.
Saying, 'What shall we do with these men? For a notable sign has been performed through them, and it is evident to all who dwell in Jerusalem, and we cannot deny it.'
But in order that it may not spread further among the people, let us warn them to speak no more in this name to anyone.
And when they called them, they commanded them not to speak at all or teach in the name of Jesus.
But Peter and John answered them, "Whether it is right in the sight of God for us to listen to you more than to God, you judge."
For we cannot help but speak of what we have seen and heard.
So after further threatening them, they let them go, finding no way to punish them because of the people, for all were praising God for what had happened.
For the man on whom this miracle of healing was performed was over forty years old.
When they were released, they went to their own companions and reported all that the chief priests and the elders had said to them.
And when they heard this, they lifted their voices together to God and said, 'Master, You who made heaven and earth, the sea, and everything in them...'
You said through the mouth of Your servant David, ‘Why did the nations rage, and the peoples meditate on futile things?’
The kings of the earth took their stand, and the rulers were gathered together against the Lord and against His Anointed.
For truly in this city, Herod and Pontius Pilate, along with the Gentiles and the people of Israel, gathered together against Your holy servant Jesus, whom You anointed.
to accomplish whatever Your hand and Your purpose had predetermined to take place.
And now, Lord, look upon their threats, and grant to Your servants that with all boldness they may speak Your word.
By stretching out Your hand to heal, and that signs and wonders may be done through the name of Your holy servant Jesus.
And when they had prayed, the place where they were assembled was shaken; and they were all filled with the Holy Spirit and spoke the word of God with boldness.
Now the multitude of those who believed were of one heart and one soul, and not one of them claimed that any of their possessions was their own, but they had everything in common.
And with great power, the apostles continued to testify to the resurrection of the Lord Jesus, and abundant grace was upon them all.
For there was not a single person in need among them. Those who owned lands or houses sold them, bringing the proceeds of the sales.
And they laid the proceeds at the feet of the apostles; and they distributed to each one as anyone had need.
Now Joseph, who was called Barnabas by the apostles (which means 'Son of Encouragement'), a Levite, a native of Cyprus,
Having a field, he sold it, and brought the money and laid it at the apostles' feet.
But a man named Ananias, with his wife Sapphira, sold a piece of property.
And he withdrew from the honor, together with his wife, and brought a portion of the proceeds and laid it at the feet of the apostles.
But Peter said, "Ananias, why has Satan filled your heart to lie to the Holy Spirit and keep back part of the price of the land for yourself?
Wasn't it yours to keep? And after it was sold, wasn't the money at your disposal? Why then did you conceive this deed in your heart? You have not lied to men, but to God.
Hearing these words, Ananias fell down and breathed his last; and great fear came upon all who heard of these things.
But the young men arose, wrapped him up, and carrying him out, buried him.
Now it was about three hours later when his wife came in, not knowing what had happened.
But Peter said to her, 'Tell me, did you sell the land for this amount?' And she said, 'Yes, for that amount.'
But Peter said to her, 'Why is it that you have agreed together to test the Spirit of the Lord? Behold, the feet of those who have buried your husband are at the door, and they will carry you out.'
Immediately, she fell down at his feet and breathed her last. When the young men entered, they found her dead; and carrying her out, they buried her beside her husband.
And great fear came upon the whole church and upon all who heard these things.
And through the hands of the apostles many signs and wonders were done among the people. And they were all together in Solomon's Portico.
Yet none of the rest dared to join them, but the people esteemed them highly.
Yet more than ever, multitudes of both men and women were believing in the Lord.
So that they brought the sick out into the streets and laid them on beds and couches, that at least the shadow of Peter passing by might overshadow some of them.
Moreover, the multitude from the surrounding cities came to Jerusalem, bringing the sick and those tormented by unclean spirits; and they were all healed.
Then the high priest rose up, and all those who were with him (that is, the sect of the Sadducees), and they were filled with jealousy.
And they laid hands on the apostles and placed them in public custody.
But an angel of the Lord opened the prison doors during the night, and leading them out, said,
Go, stand in the temple and speak to the people all the words of this Life.
And when they heard this, they entered the temple at daybreak and began teaching. But the high priest and those with him came and called together the council and all the senate of the children of Israel, and sent to the prison to have them brought.
But when the officers arrived, they did not find them in the prison. So they returned and reported.
saying, 'We found the prison securely locked, and the guards standing at the doors; but when we opened them, we found no one inside.'
Now when the high priest, the captain of the temple, and the chief priests heard these words, they were perplexed about what this could mean.
But someone came and told them, 'Look! The men whom you put in prison are standing in the temple and teaching the people.'
Then the captain went with his officers and brought them back without using force, for they were afraid of the people, lest they should be stoned.
When they had brought them, they set them before the council. And the high priest questioned them.
saying, 'Did we not strictly command you not to teach in this name? And behold, you have filled Jerusalem with your teaching, and you intend to bring this man's blood upon us!'
But Peter and the apostles answered, 'We must obey God rather than men.'
The God of our fathers raised Jesus, whom you killed by hanging him on a tree.
God has exalted Him to be both Leader and Savior, to grant repentance to Israel and forgiveness of sins.
And we are witnesses of these things, and so is the Holy Spirit, whom God has given to those who obey Him.
When they heard this, they were enraged and decided to kill them.
But a Pharisee in the council named Gamaliel, a respected teacher of the Law, stood up and ordered that the apostles be taken outside for a brief moment.
And he said to them, "Men of Israel, take care of yourselves regarding these men; consider what you are about to do."
For before these days, Theudas rose up, claiming to be someone important, and a number of about four hundred men joined him. He was killed, and all who followed him were scattered and came to nothing.
After him, Judas the Galilean arose in the days of the census and drew away a significant number of people after him. He also perished, and all who followed him were scattered.
And now I say to you, stay away from these men and let them be; for if this counsel or work is of men, it will come to nothing.
But if it is of God, you cannot overthrow it; lest perhaps you be found to fight against God.
They were persuaded by him, and when they had called in the apostles, they beat them and commanded them not to speak in the name of Jesus, and let them go.
So they went on their way from the council, rejoicing that they had been counted worthy to suffer disgrace for the name of Him.
And every day, in the temple and from house to house, they did not cease teaching and proclaiming the good news that Jesus is the Christ.
Now during those days, as the number of disciples was increasing, there arose a complaint from the Hellenists against the Hebrews, because their widows were being neglected in the daily distribution.
So the Twelve gathered all the disciples together and said, "It is not right for us to neglect the ministry of the word of God in order to wait on tables."
Therefore, brothers, select from among you seven men of good reputation, full of the Holy Spirit and wisdom, whom we may appoint to this duty.
But we will devote ourselves to prayer and to the ministry of the word.
And this proposal pleased the whole gathering; and they chose Stephen, a man full of faith and the Holy Spirit, and Philip, Prochorus, Nicanor, Timon, Parmenas, and Nicolas, a proselyte from Antioch.
They presented these men to the apostles, who prayed and laid their hands on them.
And the word of God increased, and the number of the disciples in Jerusalem multiplied greatly, and a great many of the priests became obedient to the faith.
And Stephen, full of faith and power, did great wonders and miracles among the people.
But some from the synagogue of the Libertines, Cyrenians, Alexandrians, and those from Cilicia and Asia arose and disputed with Stephen.
And they were unable to withstand the wisdom and the Spirit by which he spoke.
Then they secretly induced men to say, 'We have heard him speak blasphemous words against Moses and against God.'
So they incited the people, the elders, and the scribes, and they came upon him, seized him, and brought him before the council.
They set up false witnesses who said, "This man never ceases to speak words of blasphemy against this holy place and the Law."
For we have heard him say that this Jesus of Nazareth will destroy this place and will change the customs which Moses delivered to us.
And gazing at him, all who sat in the council saw that his face was like the face of an angel.
Then the high priest asked, "Are these accusations true?"
He replied, 'Brothers and fathers, listen to me! The God of glory appeared to our father Abraham while he was still in Mesopotamia, before he settled in Haran.
And He said to him, 'Leave your land and your relatives, and come to the land that I will show you.'
Then he left the land of the Chaldeans and settled in Haran. From there, after the death of his father, he moved him to this land where you now dwell.
And He did not give him an inheritance in it, not even a footstep; yet He promised to give it to him as a possession and to his offspring after him, though he had no child.
And God spoke in this way, that his descendants would be temporary residents in a foreign land, and they will be enslaved and mistreated for four hundred years.
And the nation to which they will be enslaved, I will judge, said God; and afterward, they will come out and worship me in this place.
And He gave him the covenant of circumcision; and thus Abraham became the father of Isaac, and he circumcised him on the eighth day. Isaac became the father of Jacob, and Jacob the father of the twelve patriarchs.
And the patriarchs, moved by jealousy against Joseph, sold him into Egypt.
And God was with him, and delivered him from all his afflictions, and granted him grace and wisdom in the sight of Pharaoh king of Egypt; and he made him governor over Egypt and all his household.
But a famine came over all the land of Egypt and Canaan, and great affliction occurred, and our forefathers could find no sustenance.
But when Jacob heard that there was grain in Egypt, he sent our forefathers there first.
And in the second visit, Joseph was made known to his brothers, and his family lineage became evident to Pharaoh.
Joseph sent and summoned his father Jacob and all his relatives, seventy-five souls in total.
So Jacob went down to Egypt, and he died there, along with our ancestors.
And they were transferred to Shechem and laid in the tomb that Abraham had purchased for a sum of silver from the sons of Hamor of Shechem.
But as the time for the promise that God had made to Abraham approached, the people multiplied and grew strong in Egypt.
Until another king arose who did not recognize Joseph.
This man, having become shrewd, oppressed our fathers by making them expose their infants, so that they would not be kept alive.
At that time, Moses was born, and he was exceptionally favored by God; he was nurtured for three months in his father's house.
When he was abandoned, Pharaoh's daughter adopted him and raised him as her own son.
And Moses was educated in all the wisdom of the Egyptians, and he was mighty in words and deeds.
But when he was about forty years old, it came into his heart to visit his brothers, the children of Israel.
And when he saw one being wronged, he defended him and avenged the oppressed by striking down the Egyptian.
He thought that his brothers would understand that God was giving them salvation by his hand, but they did not understand.
And on the following day, he appeared to them as they were quarreling and tried to reconcile them, saying, ‘Men, you are brothers; why do you wrong each other?’
But the one who was wronging his neighbor pushed him away, saying, 'Who made you a ruler and judge over us?'
Do you intend to kill me as you did the Egyptian yesterday?
So Moses fled at this saying, and became a stranger in the land of Midian, where he had two sons.
And after forty years had passed, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in the wilderness of Mount Sinai, in a flame of fire in a bush.
When Moses saw it, he marveled at the sight; as he approached to examine it, there came the voice of the Lord to him.
‘I am the God of your forefathers, the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.’ And Moses trembled with fear and did not dare to look.
But the Lord said to him, 'Remove the sandals from your feet, for the place where you are standing is holy ground.'
‘I have indeed seen the affliction of My people in Egypt, and I have heard their groaning; I have come down to deliver them. And now I am sending you to Egypt.’
This Moses, whom they rejected, saying, 'Who made you a ruler and a judge?'—this man God sent as both ruler and deliverer, through the hand of the angel who appeared to him in the bush.
This Moses led them out, doing wonders and signs in the land of Egypt, and in the Red Sea, and in the wilderness for forty years.
This is the Moses who said to the Israelites, ‘The Lord your God will raise up for you a prophet from among your own brothers, just like me; him you shall hear.’
This is the one who was among the assembly in the wilderness with the angel who spoke to him at Mount Sinai, and with our ancestors; he received living oracles to give to us.
This is the one whose ancestors refused to obey, but rejected him, turning their hearts back to Egypt.
saying to Aaron, 'Make us gods who will go before us; for as for this Moses who led us out of the land of Egypt, we do not know what has happened to him.'
And in those days, they made a golden calf and offered a sacrifice to the idol, rejoicing in the works of their own hands.
But God turned away and delivered them up to worship the host of heaven, as it is written in the book of the prophets: 'Did you bring me sacrifices and offerings in the wilderness for forty years, O house of Israel?'
And you took up the tent of Moloch and the star of your god Rephan, the images that you made to worship; therefore, I will carry you away beyond Babylon.
Our fathers had the tent of witness in the wilderness, just as the One who spoke to Moses directed him to make it according to the pattern he had seen.
Which our ancestors received and brought in with Jesus during the conquest of the nations that God drove out before the face of our ancestors, until the days of David.
Who found favor in the sight of God and asked to find a dwelling place for the God of Jacob.
But Solomon built him a house.
However, the Most High does not dwell in houses made by human hands, as the prophet says.
‘Heaven is My throne, and the earth is a footstool for My feet. What kind of house will you build for Me?’ says the Lord, ‘or what place is there for My rest?
Did not My hand make all these things?
You stiff-necked and uncircumcised in heart and ears! You always resist the Holy Spirit; as your fathers did, so do you.
Which of the prophets did your fathers not persecute? And they killed those who foretold the coming of the Righteous One, whom you have now betrayed and murdered.
You who received the law as ordained by angels, yet did not keep it.
When they heard these things, they were cut to the heart, and they gnashed their teeth at him.
But being full of the Holy Spirit, he gazed into heaven and saw the glory of God, and Jesus standing at the right hand of God.
And he said, 'Behold, I see the heavens opened and the Son of Man standing at the right hand of God.'
But they cried out with a loud voice and stopped their ears, and rushed together at him.
And they drove him out of the city and stoned him. And the witnesses laid down their garments at the feet of a young man named Saul.
And as they were stoning Stephen, he called out, 'Lord Jesus, receive my spirit!'
Then kneeling down, he cried out with a loud voice, 'Lord, do not charge them with this sin.' And when he had said this, he fell asleep.
On that day, a great persecution arose against the church in Jerusalem; and all except the apostles were scattered throughout the regions of Judea and Samaria.
Devout men buried Stephen and made great lamentation over him.
But Saul was wreaking havoc on the church, entering house after house and dragging off men and women, committing them to prison.
Therefore, those who had been scattered went about preaching the word.
Philip went down to a city in Samaria and proclaimed to them the Messiah.
The crowds paid close attention to what Philip said, as they listened eagerly and witnessed the signs he performed.
For unclean spirits, crying with a loud voice, came out of many who were possessed, and many who were paralyzed and lame were healed.
So there was great joy in that city.
But there was a certain man named Simon, who previously practiced magic in the city and amazed the people of Samaria, claiming to be someone great.
To him all the people gave heed, from the least to the greatest, saying, 'This man is the great power of God.'
And they paid close attention to him for a long time, because he had astonished them with his magic.
But when they believed Philip, as he proclaimed the good news of the Kingdom of God and the name of Jesus Christ, both men and women were baptized.
Even Simon himself believed, and after being baptized, he stayed close to Philip, amazed by the great signs and wonders he saw.
When the apostles in Jerusalem heard that Samaria had accepted the word of God, they sent Peter and John to them.
Who, after they came down, prayed for them that they might receive the Holy Spirit.
For the Holy Spirit had not yet fallen upon any of them, they had only been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.
Then they laid their hands on them, and they received the Holy Spirit.
When Simon saw that the Spirit was given through the laying on of the apostles' hands, he offered them money.
saying, "Give me also this authority, so that anyone on whom I lay my hands may receive the Holy Spirit."
But Peter said to him, 'Let your silver perish with you, because you thought that the gift of God could be purchased with money.'
You have no share or part in this matter, for your heart is not right before God.
Therefore, repent from this wickedness of yours, and pray to the Lord that, if possible, the intent of your heart may be forgiven.
For I see that you are in the gall of bitterness and the bond of iniquity.
Then Simon answered, "Pray to the Lord for me, so that nothing of what you have said may come upon me."
So, after they had testified and spoken the word of the Lord, they returned to Jerusalem, preaching the gospel in many Samaritan villages.
But an angel of the Lord spoke to Philip, saying, 'Rise and go toward the south, to the road that goes down from Jerusalem to Gaza.' This is a desolate place.
So he arose and went; and behold, there was an Ethiopian man, a eunuch of great authority under Candace, the queen of the Ethiopians, who was in charge of all her treasury, and had come to Jerusalem to worship.
He was returning home, sitting in his chariot, and was reading the prophet Isaiah.
Then the Spirit said to Philip, 'Go up and join this chariot.'
So Philip ran up to the chariot and heard the man reading the prophet Isaiah. He asked him, 'Do you understand what you are reading?'
He replied, 'How can I understand unless someone guides me?' And he invited Philip to come up and sit with him.
The passage of Scripture that he was reading was this: 'Like a sheep, he was led to the slaughter; and like a lamb before its shearer, he remains silent; so he does not open his mouth.'
In his humiliation, justice was denied him; who can recount his lineage? For his life is taken from the earth.
The eunuch answered Philip, 'I ask you, about whom does the prophet say this? Is he speaking of himself or someone else?'
Then Philip opened his mouth, and beginning from that Scripture, he preached the good news about Jesus to him.
As they were traveling along the road, they came to some water; and the eunuch said, 'Look, here is water! What is preventing me from being baptized?'
Philip said, 'If you truly believe with all your heart, you may.' And the eunuch answered, 'I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God.'
So he commanded the chariot to stop, and they both went down into the water, Philip and the eunuch, and he baptized him.
When they came up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord suddenly took Philip away, and the eunuch did not see him again, but went on his way rejoicing.
But Philip found himself at Azotus; and as he passed through, he preached the gospel in all the cities until he came to Caesarea.
Meanwhile, Saul, still breathing out threats and violence against the disciples of the Lord, approached the high priest.
He requested letters from him to the synagogues in Damascus, so that if he found any belonging to the Way, whether men or women, he might bring them bound to Jerusalem.
As he was journeying, it happened that he drew near to Damascus, and suddenly a light from heaven flashed around him.
Falling to the ground, he heard a voice saying to him, 'Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting me?'
He said, 'Who are you, Lord?' And the Lord said, 'I am Jesus, whom you are persecuting.'
But rise and enter into the city, and you will be told what you must do.
The men who traveled with him stood speechless, hearing the voice but seeing no one.
So Saul got up from the ground, and though his eyes were opened, he saw nothing. Those who were with him took him by the hand and led him into Damascus.
For three days he was without sight, and he neither ate nor drank.
Now there was a disciple at Damascus named Ananias; and the Lord said to him in a vision, 'Ananias.' He answered, 'Here I am, Lord.'
And the Lord said to him, 'Rise and go to the street called Straight, and inquire in the house of Judas for one named Saul of Tarsus; for behold, he is praying,'
And he saw in a vision a man named Ananias coming in and laying his hands on him so that he might regain his sight.
But Ananias answered, 'Lord, I have heard from many about this man, how much harm he has done to Your saints in Jerusalem.'
And here he has the authority from the chief priests to imprison all who call upon Your name.
But the Lord said to him, 'Go, for this man is a chosen instrument of mine to bear my name before the Gentiles and kings and the children of Israel.'
For I will show him how much he must suffer for the sake of my name.
So Ananias went and entered the house; and laying his hands on him, he said, 'Brother Saul, the Lord Jesus, who appeared to you on the road as you came, has sent me that you may regain your sight and be filled with the Holy Spirit.'
And immediately something like scales fell from his eyes, and he regained his sight. Then he arose and was baptized, and after taking food, he was strengthened.
And Saul spent several days with the disciples in Damascus, growing in strength and understanding.
And immediately in the synagogues he proclaimed Jesus, declaring that he is the Son of God.
All who heard him were astonished and said, "Is this not the man who wreaked havoc in Jerusalem among those who called on this name? And has he come here for this purpose, to bring them bound before the chief priests?"
But Saul grew stronger and kept confounding the Jews who lived in Damascus, proving that this Jesus is the Christ.
And as the days were being fulfilled, the Jews plotted together to kill him.
But their plot against Saul became known. They watched the gates both day and night, intending to kill him.
But the disciples took him by night and lowered him in a basket through an opening in the wall.
When Saul arrived in Jerusalem, he tried to join the disciples, but they were all afraid of him, not believing that he was truly a disciple.
But Barnabas took him and brought him to the apostles, and he declared to them how he had seen the Lord on the road, and that the Lord had spoken to him, and how boldly he had preached in the name of Jesus at Damascus.
So he went in and out among them in Jerusalem, speaking boldly in the name of the Lord Jesus.
He spoke and debated with the Hellenists, but they attempted to kill him.
But when the brothers learned of this, they brought him down to Caesarea and sent him away to Tarsus.
So, the churches throughout all Judea, Galilee, and Samaria enjoyed peace, being built up and walking in the fear of the Lord, and in the comfort of the Holy Spirit, they were multiplied.
As Peter was traveling through all regions, he came down also to the saints who lived in Lydda.
And there he found a certain man named Aeneas, who had been bedridden for eight years, for he was paralyzed.
And Peter said to him, ‘Aeneas, Jesus Christ heals you. Rise and make your bed.’ And immediately he rose up.
And all the residents of Lydda and Sharon saw him and turned to the Lord.
In Joppa, there was a disciple named Tabitha, which translated means Dorcas; she was full of good works and acts of charity that she did.
It came to pass in those days that she became ill and died; after washing her, they laid her in an upper chamber.
As Peter was in Lydda near Joppa, the disciples, hearing that he was there, sent two men to him, urging him to delay no longer in coming to them.
So Peter rose and went with them. When he arrived, they took him to the upstairs room. All the widows stood beside him, weeping and showing him the tunics and garments that Dorcas had made while she was with them.
But Peter, having put them all outside, knelt down and prayed; and turning to the body, he said, 'Tabitha, arise.' And she opened her eyes, and when she saw Peter, she sat up.
And giving her his hand, he raised her up; and calling the saints and the widows, he presented her alive.
And this became known throughout all of Joppa, and many believed in the Lord.
So it was that he stayed many days in Joppa with a certain Simon, a tanner.
Now there was a certain man in Caesarea named Cornelius, a centurion of what was known as the Italian Regiment.
He was a devout man and one who feared God with all his household; he gave many alms to the people and prayed to God always.
About the ninth hour of the day, he distinctly saw in a vision an angel of God coming in and saying to him, 'Cornelius!'
But when he gazed at him and became frightened, he said, 'What is it, Lord?' And the angel said to him, 'Your prayers and your acts of charity have ascended as a memorial before God.'
And now, send men to Joppa to bring Simon, who is called Peter.
He is lodging with Simon, a tanner, whose house is by the sea.
When the angel who spoke to Cornelius had departed, he called two of his servants and a devout soldier from among those who attended him.
After explaining everything to them, he sent them to Joppa.
The next day, as they were on their journey and approaching the city, Peter went up on the roof to pray at about the sixth hour.
And he became very hungry and wanted to eat; but while they were preparing the meal, a trance fell upon him.
He saw heaven opened, and something like a great sheet descending, being let down to the earth by its four corners.
In it were all kinds of four-footed animals of the earth, wild beasts, creeping things, and birds of the air.
And a voice came to him, saying, ‘Get up, Peter, slay and eat.’
But Peter said, 'No, Lord; for I have never eaten anything that is common or unclean.'
And the voice spoke to him again a second time: 'What God has made clean, do not you call common.'
This happened three times, and then the vessel was lifted up into heaven again.
Now while Peter was perplexed within himself about what the vision he had seen might mean, behold, the men sent from Cornelius had made inquiry for Simon's house and stood at the gate.
And when they called out, they were asking whether Simon, who is called Peter, was staying here.
While Peter was pondering the vision, the Spirit said to him, 'Behold, three men are seeking you.'
But arise and go down, and accompany them without hesitation, for I have sent them.
And descending, Peter said to the men, 'Behold, I am the one you seek. What is the reason for your coming?'
And they said, 'Cornelius, a centurion, a righteous man and one who fears God, well spoken of by the whole Jewish nation, was directed by a holy angel to send for you to his house and to hear words from you.'
So he invited them in and offered them lodging. The next day he rose and went away with them, and some of the brothers from Joppa accompanied him.
And the following day they entered into Caesarea. Cornelius was expecting them and had called together his relatives and close friends.
As Peter entered, Cornelius met him, fell down at his feet, and worshiped.
But Peter lifted him up, saying, 'Stand up; I too am just a man.'
As he talked with him, he entered and found many gathered together.
And he said to them, ‘You know how it is unlawful for a Jew to associate with or visit a Gentile; but God has shown me that I should not call any man common or unclean.’
So I came without objection when I was sent for. I ask you, therefore, what reason did you send for me?
And Cornelius said, ‘Four days ago to this very hour, I was fasting until now; and at the ninth hour, I was praying in my house; and behold, a man stood before me in bright clothing.’
And he said, ‘Cornelius, your prayer has been heard, and your acts of charity have been remembered before God.’
Send therefore to Joppa and summon Simon, who is called Peter. He is staying in the house of Simon, a tanner, by the sea; when he comes, he will speak to you.
So I sent for you immediately, and you have done well to come. Now, we are all here in the presence of God to hear everything that you have been commanded by the Lord.
Then Peter opened his mouth and said: "In truth, I perceive that God shows no partiality."
But in every nation, he who fears Him and works righteousness is accepted by Him.
The message He sent to the children of Israel proclaiming peace through Jesus Christ—He is Lord of all.
You yourselves know what happened throughout all Judea, beginning from Galilee after the baptism that John proclaimed.
Jesus of Nazareth, how God anointed him with the Holy Spirit and with power. He went about doing good and healing all who were oppressed by the devil, for God was with him.
And we are witnesses of all that he did in the land of the Jews and in Jerusalem; they also killed him by hanging him on a tree.
This is the one whom God raised up on the third day and made Him to be visibly present.
not to all the people, but to witnesses whom God had previously chosen, to us who ate and drank with Him after He rose from the dead.
And He commanded us to proclaim to the people and to testify that He is the one appointed by God to be the Judge of the living and the dead.
To Him all the prophets bear witness, that through His name whoever believes in Him will receive forgiveness of sins.
While Peter was still speaking these words, the Holy Spirit fell upon all who were listening to the message.
And those of the circumcision who had come with Peter were astonished that the gift of the Holy Spirit was also poured out on the Gentiles.
For they were hearing them speaking in tongues and magnifying God.
Then Peter responded, "Can anyone withhold water for baptizing these people, who have received the Holy Spirit just as we have?"
He commanded them to be baptized in the name of the Lord. Then they asked him to remain for a few days.
Now the apostles and the brethren who were throughout Judea heard that even the Gentiles had received the word of God.
And when Peter went up to Jerusalem, those of the circumcision contended with him.
saying, 'You went in to uncircumcised men and ate with them.'
But Peter began and explained to them in order, saying,
I was in the city of Joppa praying, and in a trance I saw a vision, something like a great sheet descending, let down from heaven by four corners, and it came down to me.
When I looked closely, I saw four-footed animals of the earth, wild beasts, creeping things, and birds of the air.
I heard a voice saying to me, 'Rise, Peter; kill and eat.'
But I said, 'By no means, Lord; for nothing common or unclean has ever entered my mouth.'
But the voice answered me again from heaven, ‘What God has made clean, you must not call common.’
This happened three times, and all was drawn up again into heaven.
And behold, at that very moment, three men stood before the house in which I was, sent from Caesarea to me.
And the Spirit said to me to go with them, doubting nothing. Moreover, these six brethren accompanied me, and we entered the house of the man.
He reported to us how he had seen the angel standing in his house and saying to him, 'Send men to Joppa and summon Simon, who is called Peter.'
He will speak words to you by which you will be saved, you and all your household.
As I began to speak, the Holy Spirit fell upon them just as he did upon us at the beginning.
Then I remembered the word of the Lord, how He said, 'John indeed baptized with water, but you shall be baptized with the Holy Spirit.'
If therefore God gave them the same gift as He gave us when we believed on the Lord Jesus Christ, who was I to stand in God's way?
When they heard these things, they became silent and glorified God, saying, 'Then God has granted to the Gentiles repentance unto life also.'
Now those who had been scattered because of the persecution that arose over Stephen traveled as far as Phoenicia, Cyprus, and Antioch, speaking the word to no one except Jews.
But there were some men from Cyprus and Cyrene who, upon entering Antioch, spoke to the Hellenists, proclaiming the good news of the Lord Jesus.
And the hand of the Lord was with them, and a great number who believed turned to the Lord.
News about them reached the ears of the church in Jerusalem, and they sent Barnabas to go as far as Antioch.
When he arrived and saw the grace of God, he was glad and encouraged them all to remain true to the Lord with all their hearts.
For he was a good man, full of the Holy Spirit and of faith; and a large number of people were added to the Lord.
Then Barnabas went to Tarsus to search for Saul, and when he found him, he brought him to Antioch.
So it happened that they were assembled together for a whole year in the church, and they taught a large crowd; and it was in Antioch that the disciples were first called Christians.
During those days, prophets came down from Jerusalem to Antioch.
And one of them, named Agabus, stood up and indicated through the Spirit that a great famine was about to come upon the entire inhabited earth; this took place during the reign of Claudius Caesar.
So the disciples, each according to his ability, determined to send relief to the brothers living in Judea.
This they did, sending it to the elders by the hand of Barnabas and Saul.
About that time, King Herod laid hands on some who belonged to the church, intending to harm them.
He executed James the brother of John with the sword.
And when he saw that it was pleasing to the Jews, he added to seize Peter also. Now it was during the days of Unleavened Bread.
Whom he seized and put in prison, assigning four squads of soldiers to guard him, intending to bring him out to the people after the Passover.
So Peter was kept in prison, but earnest prayer for him was made to God by the church.
When Herod was about to bring him out, that very night Peter was sleeping between two soldiers, bound with two chains; and guards were before the door watching over the prison.
And behold, an angel of the Lord stood beside him, and a light shone in the prison. Striking Peter on the side, he awoke him, saying, 'Quickly, arise!' And his chains fell off his hands.
Then the angel said to him, 'Gird yourself and tie on your sandals.' And so he did. And the angel said to him, 'Wrap your cloak around you and follow me.'
So Peter went out and followed him, not realizing that what was happening through the angel was true; he thought he was seeing a vision.
They passed through the first and second guards and came to the iron gate that leads into the city. This gate opened for them of its own accord, and when they had gone out, they went down one street; and immediately the angel departed from them.
And when Peter came to himself, he said, "Now I truly know that the Lord has sent His angel and has rescued me from the hand of Herod and from all the expectation of the Jewish people."
When he realized this, he went to the house of Mary, the mother of John, whose surname was Mark, where many were gathered together and were praying.
And when he knocked at the door of the gateway, a maidservant named Rhoda came to answer.
Recognizing Peter's voice, she was so overwhelmed with joy that she did not open the gate; instead, she ran to announce that Peter was standing at the gate.
They said to her, "You are out of your mind!" But she insisted that it was so. They replied, "It must be his angel."
But Peter continued knocking. When they opened the door, they saw him and were astonished.
But motioning to them with his hand to be silent, he described to them how the Lord had brought him out of the prison. And he said, "Go, tell James and the brothers about this." Then he departed and went to another place.
Now when day had come, there was no small commotion among the soldiers over what had become of Peter.
But Herod, after searching for him and not finding him, questioned the guards and ordered them to be executed. He then went down from Judea to Caesarea and stayed there.
Now Herod was angry with the people of Tyre and Sidon; and they came to him with one accord, and having persuaded Blastus, the king's chamberlain, they asked for peace, because their country depended on the king's country for food.
On a designated day, Herod, adorned in royal robes, took his seat on the platform and delivered an oration to the people.
But the crowd shouted, 'It is the voice of a god, not of a man!'
Immediately, an angel of the Lord struck him down, because he did not give glory to God. And he was eaten by worms and died.
But the word of God continued to grow and flourish.
Then Barnabas and Saul returned from Jerusalem after they had completed their service, bringing with them John, who was called Mark.
Now there were in the church at Antioch prophets and teachers: Barnabas, Simeon who was called Niger, Lucius of Cyrene, Manaen a lifelong friend of Herod the tetrarch, and Saul.
While they were worshiping the Lord and fasting, the Holy Spirit said, 'Set apart for me Barnabas and Saul for the work to which I have called them.'
Then, after fasting and praying, they laid their hands on them and sent them away.
So, being sent out by the Holy Spirit, they went down to Seleucia, and from there they sailed to Cyprus.
When they arrived at Salamis, they proclaimed the word of God in the synagogues of the Jews. They also had John as their assistant.
And when they had traversed the island as far as Paphos, they found a certain magician, a false prophet, a Jew whose name was Bar-Jesus.
Who was with the proconsul, Sergius Paulus, an intelligent man. This man summoned Barnabas and Saul and sought to hear the word of God.
But Elymas the sorcerer opposed them, for that is the translation of his name, seeking to distort the proconsul from the faith.
But Saul, who is also called Paul, filled with the Holy Spirit, looked intently at him.
He said, "O full of all deceit and every villainy, you son of the devil, enemy of all righteousness, will you not cease making crooked the straight paths of the Lord?
And now, behold, the hand of the Lord is upon you, and you will be blind, unable to see the sun for a season. Immediately, mist and darkness fell upon him, and he went about seeking someone to lead him by the hand.
Then the proconsul, when he saw what had happened, believed, being astonished at the teaching of the Lord.
Now Paul and his companions set sail from Paphos and came to Perga in Pamphylia; but John departed from them and returned to Jerusalem.
But passing through Perga, they arrived at Antioch in Pisidia; and entering the synagogue on the Sabbath day, they sat down.
After the reading of the Law and the Prophets, the rulers of the synagogue sent word to them, saying, 'Men, brothers, if you have any word of encouragement for the people, speak.'
Standing up, Paul motioned with his hand and said: 'Men of Israel and you who fear God, listen carefully.
The God of this people, Israel, chose our ancestors, and He elevated the people during their sojourn in the land of Egypt, and with a mighty arm, He brought them out from there.
And for about forty years He sustained them in the wilderness.
And after destroying seven nations in the land of Canaan, He distributed their land to them as an inheritance.
And after that, for four hundred and fifty years, He gave them judges until Samuel the prophet.
Then they asked for a king, and God gave them Saul the son of Kish, a man from the tribe of Benjamin, for forty years.
And when He had removed him, He raised up David to be their king, of whom He testified, saying, 'I have found David, the son of Jesse, a man after my own heart, who will fulfill all my purposes.'
From this man's descendants, God has brought to Israel a Savior, Jesus, as He promised.
Before His coming, John preached a baptism of repentance to all the people of Israel.
As John was completing his course, he said, ‘Who do you suppose I am? I am not the one you are looking for; but there comes one after me, whose sandals I am not fit to untie.'
Men, brothers, sons of the family of Abraham, and you who fear God among us, to you the message of this salvation has been sent.
For those who dwell in Jerusalem and their rulers, not recognizing him, fulfilled the words of the prophets that are read every Sabbath.
And though they found no valid reason for His death, they requested Pilate to have Him executed.
And when they had fulfilled all that was written concerning Him, they took Him down from the tree and laid Him in a tomb.
But God raised Him from the dead.
He was seen for many days by those who came up with Him from Galilee to Jerusalem, who are now His witnesses to the people.
And we declare to you the good news of the promise made to the fathers, that this promise God has fulfilled to us their children by raising up Jesus.
As it is written in the second Psalm, 'You are my Son; today I have begotten you.'
And as for His raising Him from the dead, never again to return to decay, He has spoken in this way: 'I will give you the holy and faithful promises made to David.'
Therefore, He also says in another psalm, 'You will not allow Your Holy One to see corruption.'
For David, after he had served his own generation by the purpose of God, fell asleep; and he was buried with his fathers, and saw decay.
But the One whom God raised did not experience decay.
Let it be known to you, brothers, that through Him forgiveness of sins is proclaimed to you.
And from all the things from which you could not be justified by the Law of Moses, in this, everyone who believes is justified.
Therefore, take heed, lest what is said in the prophets come upon you:
‘Behold, you despisers, and marvel, and perish! For I am doing a work in your days, a work which you will not believe, though it were told to you.’
As they were leaving the synagogue, the people invited them to speak further about these things on the next Sabbath.
When the synagogue was dismissed, many of the Jews and devout converts to Judaism followed Paul and Barnabas, who spoke to them and urged them to continue in the grace of God.
On the next Sabbath, nearly the whole city came together to hear the word of God.
But when the Jews saw the crowds, they were filled with jealousy and began to contradict what was spoken by Paul, vehemently opposing and slandering him.
Then Paul and Barnabas boldly declared, 'It was necessary that the word of God be spoken first to you. But since you reject it and judge yourselves unworthy of eternal life, behold, we turn to the Gentiles.'
For so the Lord has commanded us: 'I have made you a light for the Gentiles, that you may bring salvation to the ends of the earth.'
And when the Gentiles heard this, they rejoiced and accepted the word of the Lord, and as many as were appointed to eternal life believed.
And the word of the Lord spread throughout the entire region.
But the Jews stirred up the devout women of high standing and the leading men of the city, and incited a persecution against Paul and Barnabas, and drove them out of their district.
But shaking off the dust from their feet against them, they went on to Iconium.
And the disciples were filled with joy and the Holy Spirit.
In Iconium, Paul and Barnabas entered together into the Jewish synagogue and spoke in such a way that a great multitude of both Jews and Greeks believed.
But the unbelieving Jews stirred up and poisoned the minds of the Gentiles against the brothers.
Therefore, they spent a considerable amount of time speaking boldly for the Lord, who bore witness to the word of His grace, granting signs and wonders to be performed by their hands.
But the city’s populace was divided; some were aligned with the Jews, while others sided with the apostles.
When an assault was made by both the Gentiles and the Jews, along with their rulers, to mistreat and stone them,
Aware of the plot against them, they fled to the cities of Lycaonia, Lystra, and Derbe, and the surrounding region.
And there they were proclaiming the good news.
And in Lystra, a certain man sat who was unable to walk, crippled from his mother’s womb, who had never walked.
This man heard Paul speaking. Paul, observing him intently and seeing that he had faith to be healed,
He said with a loud voice, ‘Stand upright on your feet!’ And he leaped up and began to walk.
But when the crowds saw what Paul had done, they raised their voices, saying in Lycaonian, 'The gods have come down to us in the likeness of men!'
And they called Barnabas Zeus, and Paul they called Hermes, because he was the chief speaker.
But the priest of Zeus, whose temple was just outside their city, brought bulls and wreaths to the gates, intending with the crowds to offer a sacrifice.
But when the apostles Barnabas and Paul heard of it, they tore their clothes and rushed into the crowd, crying out,
Men, why are you doing these things? We are also men, just like you, and we bring you good news, turning you from these worthless things to the living God, who made the heaven and the earth and the sea and everything in them.
In past generations, He allowed all nations to go their own ways.
Yet He did not leave Himself without witness, for He did good by giving you rains from heaven and fruitful seasons, filling your hearts with food and gladness.
Even saying these things, they barely restrained the crowds from offering sacrifices to them.
But Jews came from Antioch and Iconium, and having persuaded the crowds, they stoned Paul and dragged him out of the city, supposing that he was dead.
But when the disciples gathered around him, he rose up and entered the city; and the next day he went out with Barnabas to Derbe.
After preaching the gospel in that city and winning many to faith, they returned to Lystra, Iconium, and Antioch.
Strengthening the souls of the disciples, encouraging them to continue in the faith, and saying that through many tribulations it is necessary for us to enter the kingdom of God.
And when they had appointed elders for them in every church, and had prayed with fasting, they commended them to the Lord in whom they had believed.
And after traversing Pisidia, they arrived in Pamphylia.
And after speaking the word in Perga, they descended to Attalia.
From there they sailed to Antioch, where they had been entrusted to the grace of God for the work they had fulfilled.
Upon their arrival, they gathered the church together and reported all that God had accomplished through them, and how He had opened the door of faith to the Gentiles.
So they remained there for a considerable time with the disciples.
And certain men came down from Judea and taught the brethren, saying, "Unless you are circumcised according to the custom of Moses, you cannot be saved."
And when there arose no small contention and inquiry by Paul and Barnabas with them, they appointed Paul and Barnabas and some others from among them to go up to the apostles and elders in Jerusalem concerning this issue.
So, being sent on their way by the church, they traveled through Phoenicia and Samaria, reporting the conversion of the Gentiles, and bringing great joy to all the brethren.
When they arrived in Jerusalem, they were welcomed by the church and the apostles and the elders, and they reported all that God had done with them, including how He had opened the door of faith to the Gentiles.
But some of the believers who belonged to the sect of the Pharisees rose up and said, 'It is necessary to circumcise them and to command them to keep the Law of Moses.'
The apostles and the elders were gathered together to consider this matter.
And after much discussion, Peter rose and said to them, 'Men, brethren, you know that from ancient days, God chose through my mouth to make the Gentiles hear the word of the Gospel and to believe.'
And God, who knows the heart, testified to them by giving them the Holy Spirit, just as He did to us.
And He made no distinction between us and them, cleansing their hearts by faith.
Now therefore, why do you test God by placing a yoke upon the neck of the disciples, which neither our fathers nor we were able to bear?
But we believe that through the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ we shall be saved in the same manner as they.
Then all the multitude fell silent and listened as Barnabas and Paul related all the things God had done among the Gentiles through them.
After they had fallen silent, James replied, "Men, brothers, listen to me."
Simeon has explained how God first visited the Gentiles to take from them a people for His name.
And the words of the prophets agree with this, as it is written:
After this, I will return and rebuild the fallen tent of David; I will rebuild its ruins and restore it.
so that the remnant of mankind may seek the Lord, and all the nations upon whom My name has been called, says the Lord who does all these things.
Known to God from eternity are all His works.
Therefore, I judge that we should not trouble those from among the Gentiles who are turning to God.
But we should instruct them to refrain from things polluted by idols, from sexual immorality, from what is strangled, and from blood.
For Moses has been preached in every city from ancient generations, and he is read aloud in the synagogues every Sabbath.
Then it seemed good to the apostles and the elders, with the whole church, to choose men from among them and send them to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas: Judas, who was called Barsabbas, and Silas, leading men among the brethren.
They wrote this letter by their hand: The apostles and the elders, and the brothers, to the brothers of the Gentiles in Antioch, Syria, and Cilicia, greetings.
Since we have heard that some of our number have troubled you with words, unsettling your souls, saying you must be circumcised and observe the law, to which we gave no such instruction,
It seemed good to us, having come together in unity, to choose men to send to you along with our beloved Barnabas and Paul.
men who have risked their lives for the sake of our Lord Jesus Christ.
Therefore, we have sent Judas and Silas, who will also report the same things by word of mouth.
For it has seemed good to the Holy Spirit and to us to impose on you no greater burden than these essential things.
You are to abstain from food offered to idols, from consuming blood, from anything that has been strangled, and from sexual immorality. If you keep yourselves from these things, you will do well. Farewell.
So when they were sent off, they went down to Antioch, where they gathered the congregation together and delivered the letter.
When they read it, they rejoiced at the encouragement it brought.
Judas and Silas, who themselves were prophets, encouraged the brothers with many words and strengthened them.
After some time had passed, they were sent away in peace by the brothers to return to the apostles.
But it seemed good to Silas to remain there.
But Paul and Barnabas stayed in Antioch, teaching and proclaiming the word of the Lord, along with many others.
After some days, Paul said to Barnabas, 'Let us return and visit our brothers in every city where we proclaimed the word of the Lord, to see how they are doing.'
But Barnabas resolved to take along John, called Mark.
But Paul considered it serious that the one who had deserted them in Pamphylia and had not continued with them in the work should not be taken along.
As a result, a sharp disagreement arose, so that they parted ways. Barnabas took Mark and sailed away to Cyprus.
But Paul chose Silas and departed, commended to the grace of God by the brothers.
And he traveled through Syria and Cilicia, strengthening the churches.
Then he arrived at Derbe and Lystra. Behold, there was a disciple there named Timothy, the son of a certain Jewish woman who was a believer, but his father was a Greek.
He was well spoken of by the brothers in Lystra and Iconium.
Paul wanted to take him along on the journey, so he circumcised him because of the Jews who lived in that area; for they all knew that his father was a Greek.
As they traveled through the cities, they delivered to them the decrees that had been decided upon by the apostles and the elders in Jerusalem, to be observed.
So the churches were strengthened in their faith and grew in number day by day.
Now they traveled through the region of Phrygia and Galatia, having been forbidden by the Holy Spirit to speak the word in Asia.
When they had come to the region of Mysia, they attempted to go into Bithynia, but the Spirit did not permit them.
So, passing by Mysia, they descended to Troas.
And during the night, a vision appeared to Paul: A man of Macedonia stood and pleaded with him, saying, 'Come over to Macedonia and help us.'
When he had seen the vision, we immediately sought to go into Macedonia, concluding that God had called us to preach the Gospel to them.
Setting sail from Troas, we made a straight course to Samothrace, and the next day to Neapolis.
From there we went to Philippi, which is the foremost city of that part of Macedonia, a Roman colony. And we stayed in that city for some days.
On the Sabbath day, we went outside the city gate to the riverside, where we expected to find a place of prayer, and sitting down, we spoke to the women who had gathered there.
One particular woman named Lydia, a seller of purple goods from the city of Thyatira, who was a worshiper of God, was listening; the Lord opened her heart to pay attention to the things spoken by Paul.
And after she was baptized, along with her household, she urged us, saying, "If you have judged me to be faithful to the Lord, come and stay at my house." And she insisted until we agreed.
As we were going to prayer, a certain slave girl met us, who had a spirit of divination, and brought her masters much profit by fortune-telling.
This girl followed Paul and Silas and cried out, saying, "These men are servants of the Most High God, who proclaim to us the way of salvation."
This continued for many days. Paul, greatly annoyed, turned to the spirit and said, 'I command you in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her.' And it came out at that very hour.
But when her owners saw that their hope of profit was gone, they seized Paul and Silas and dragged them into the marketplace before the rulers.
And bringing them before the magistrates, they said, "These men, being Jews, are causing great disturbance in our city."
and they proclaim customs that are not lawful for us to accept or practice, being Romans.
And the crowd joined in attacking them, and the magistrates tore off their clothes and ordered them to be beaten with rods.
After they had inflicted many blows upon them, they threw them into prison, ordering the jailer to keep them securely.
Having received such an order, he put them into the innermost prison and fastened their feet in the stocks.
But around midnight, Paul and Silas were praying and singing hymns to God, and the other prisoners were listening to them.
But suddenly there was a great earthquake, so that the foundations of the prison were shaken; and immediately all the doors were opened and everyone's chains were unfastened.
When the jailer woke up and saw the prison doors wide open, he drew his sword and was about to kill himself, thinking that the prisoners had escaped.
But Paul called out with a loud voice, 'Do not harm yourself, for we are all here!'
He called for lights, rushed in, and trembling with fear, he fell down before Paul and Silas.
He brought them outside and asked, 'Sirs, what must I do to be saved?'
They replied, 'Believe in the Lord Jesus Christ, and you will be saved—you and your household.'
And they spoke to him the message of the Lord, along with all those in his household.
And taking them at that very hour of the night, he washed their wounds, and he and all his household were baptized without delay.
Then he brought them into his house and set a table before them, and he rejoiced greatly with his entire household, having believed in God.
But when day had come, the magistrates sent the officers, saying, Release those men.
The jailer reported these words to Paul, saying, 'The magistrates have sent to let you go. Now therefore, you may go out and depart in peace.'
But Paul said to them, 'They have beaten us publicly, uncondemned men who are Roman citizens, and they have thrown us into prison; and now they secretly want to release us? No, indeed! Let them come themselves and bring us out.'
So the jailers reported these words to the magistrates, and they were alarmed upon hearing that they were Roman citizens.
And they came and encouraged them, and after bringing them out, they asked them to leave the city.
After leaving the prison, they went to Lydia’s house; and when they saw the brothers, they encouraged them and then departed.
Now when they had traveled through Amphipolis and Apollonia, they came to Thessalonica, where there was a synagogue of the Jews.
As was his custom, Paul went in to them, and for three Sabbaths he reasoned with them from the Scriptures.
explaining and proving that it was necessary for the Christ to suffer and to rise from the dead, and saying, 'This Jesus whom I proclaim to you is the Christ.'
And some of them were persuaded and joined Paul and Silas, along with a great multitude of the devout Greeks, and not a few leading women.
But the unbelieving Jews took some wicked men from the marketplace, formed a mob, and stirred up the city, attacking the house of Jason; they sought to bring them out to the assembly.
But when they could not find them, they dragged Jason and some of the brothers before the city rulers, shouting, 'These men who have turned the world upside down have come here also.'
whom Jason has received; and these men are all acting contrary to the decrees of Caesar, saying there is another king, Jesus.
And they stirred up the crowd and the city officials who heard these things.
And when they had taken sufficient security from Jason and the others, they released them.
The brethren immediately sent Paul and Silas away by night to Berea; and when they arrived, they went into the Jewish synagogue.
These were more noble-minded than those in Thessalonica, for they received the word with all readiness of mind and searched the Scriptures daily to see whether these things were so.
Therefore, many of them believed, as did a number of prominent Greek women and men.
But when the Jews from Thessalonica learned that the word of God was proclaimed by Paul in Berea also, they came there too, agitating and disturbing the crowds.
Immediately then, the brothers sent Paul away to go as far as the sea; but Silas and Timothy remained there.
The men who accompanied Paul brought him to Athens; and having received a command for Silas and Timothy to join him as quickly as possible, they departed.
While Paul was waiting for them in Athens, his spirit was provoked within him as he observed the city full of idols.
So he reasoned in the synagogue with the Jews and those who worshipped God, and in the marketplace every day with those who happened to be there.
Some of the Epicurean and Stoic philosophers encountered him, and some said, 'What does this seed picker want to say?' Others said, 'He seems to be a proclaimer of foreign deities,' because he was preaching Jesus and the resurrection to them.
And taking hold of him, they brought him to the Areopagus, saying, 'May we know what this new teaching is that you are proclaiming?'
For you bring some strange things to our ears; therefore we wish to know what these things could mean.
Now all the Athenians and the foreigners residing there spent their time in nothing but telling or hearing something new.
Standing in the midst of the Areopagus, Paul said: "Men of Athens, I perceive that in every way you are very superstitious."
For as I walked around and examined your objects of worship, I even found an altar with this inscription: 'To an Unknown God.' Therefore, what you worship as unknown, this I proclaim to you.
The God who made the world and everything in it, being Lord of heaven and earth, does not dwell in temples made by human hands.
Nor is He served by human hands, as if He needed anything, since He Himself gives to all life and breath and everything else.
And He made from one blood every nation of men to dwell on all the face of the earth, having determined their appointed times and the boundaries of their dwelling places.
that they might seek God, if perhaps they might grope for Him and find Him, though He is not far from each one of us.
For in Him we live and move and have our being; as even some of your own poets have said, 'For we are also His offspring.'
Being therefore the offspring of God, we ought not to think that the divine nature is like gold or silver or stone, shaped by human art and imagination.
Therefore, having overlooked the times of ignorance, God now commands all people everywhere to repent.
For He has set a day on which He will judge the world in righteousness by the man whom He has appointed. He has given assurance to all by raising Him from the dead.
Now when they heard about the resurrection of the dead, some mocked, while others said, 'We want to hear you again on this matter.'
And so, Paul went out from their midst.
Yet some men joined him and believed, among whom were Dionysius the Areopagite, a woman named Damaris, and others with them.
After these events, Paul departed from Athens and came to Corinth.
And having found a certain Jew named Aquila, a native of Pontus, recently come from Italy with his wife Priscilla, because Claudius had commanded all the Jews to depart from Rome, he went to them.
And because they shared the same trade, he stayed with them and worked; for they were tentmakers by trade.
And he reasoned in the synagogue every Sabbath, and persuaded both Jews and Greeks.
But when Silas and Timothy came down from Macedonia, Paul was compelled by the Spirit and testified to the Jews that Jesus is the Christ.
But when they opposed and blasphemed him, he shook out his garments and said to them, "Your blood be upon your own heads; I am innocent. From now on I will go to the Gentiles."
And after leaving there, he came to the house of a certain man named Justus, a God-fearing man, whose house was next to the synagogue.
Crispus, the leader of the synagogue, believed in the Lord along with his whole household. Many of the Corinthians who heard Paul believed and were baptized.
But the Lord said to Paul in a vision at night, 'Do not be afraid, but speak and do not be silent.'
For I am with you, and no one will attack you to harm you, for I have many people in this city.
And he remained there for a year and six months, teaching the word of God among them.
But while Gallio was proconsul of Achaia, the Jews made a united attack against Paul and brought him before the judgment seat.
saying, "This man is persuading people to worship God contrary to the law."
But just as Paul was about to open his mouth, Gallio said to the Jews, 'If it were a matter of wrongdoing or a wicked crime, O Jews, I would have reason to listen to you.'
But if it is a matter concerning words, names, and your law, you yourselves shall judge; for I do not wish to be a judge of these matters.
And he drove them away from the judgment seat.
Then all the Greeks seized Sosthenes, the chief ruler of the synagogue, and beat him before the judgment seat; and Gallio took no notice of these things.
So Paul, having stayed many days longer, said farewell to the brothers and sailed away to Syria, and with him were Priscilla and Aquila, having shorn his head in Cenchreae; for he had taken a vow.
He arrived in Ephesus, and he left them there; but he himself entered the synagogue and engaged in discussion with the Jews.
When they asked him to stay longer with them, he did not consent.
But he took leave of them, saying, 'I must by all means celebrate the upcoming feast in Jerusalem; and I will return to you again if God wills.' And he set sail from Ephesus.
And when he had come down to Caesarea, he went up and greeted the church; then he went down to Antioch.
After spending some time there, he departed and went through the Galatian region and Phrygia, strengthening all the disciples.
Now a certain Jew named Apollos, born in Alexandria, an eloquent man, came to Ephesus; he was mighty in the Scriptures.
He was well-instructed in the way of the Lord, and being fervent in spirit, he spoke and taught accurately the things concerning the Lord, knowing only the baptism of John.
He began to speak boldly in the synagogue; but when Aquila and Priscilla heard him, they took him aside and explained to him the way of God more accurately.
And when he intended to go to Achaia, the brothers encouraged him and wrote to the disciples to welcome him; and upon his arrival, he greatly helped those who had believed through grace.
For he powerfully refuted the Jews in public debate, demonstrating through the Scriptures that Jesus was the Christ.
While Apollos was at Corinth, Paul passed through the upper regions and came to Ephesus. There he found some disciples.
He asked them, "Did you receive the Holy Spirit when you believed?" They replied, "No, we have not even heard that there is a Holy Spirit."
He asked them, "Into what then were you baptized?" And they said, "Into John’s baptism."
Then Paul said, "John indeed baptized with a baptism of repentance, telling the people to believe in the One who would come after him, that is, in Christ Jesus."
Upon hearing this, they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.
And when Paul had laid his hands upon them, the Holy Spirit came upon them, and they began to speak in tongues and prophesy.
There were about twelve men in all.
And he entered the synagogue and spoke boldly for three months, reasoning and persuading concerning the kingdom of God.
But when some became hardened and disobedient, speaking evil of the Way before the multitude, he departed from them and separated the disciples, reasoning daily in the school of Tyrannus.
This continued for two years, so that all who lived in Asia heard the word of the Lord Jesus, both Jews and Greeks.
And God was performing extraordinary miracles by the hands of Paul.
So that even handkerchiefs or aprons that had touched his skin were carried away to the sick, and diseases left them, and evil spirits came out of them.
But some of the itinerant Jewish exorcists undertook to invoke the name of the Lord Jesus over those who had evil spirits, saying, 'I adjure you by Jesus whom Paul proclaims.'
And there were seven sons of Sceva, a Jewish chief priest, who were doing this.
But the evil spirit answered and said, 'Jesus I know, and Paul I am acquainted with; but who are you?'
And the man in whom the evil spirit was came upon them, overpowered them, and prevailed against them, so that they fled out of that house naked and wounded.
This became known to all the Jews and Greeks living in Ephesus, and fear fell upon them all, and the name of the Lord Jesus was magnified.
Many of those who had believed came forward, confessing and declaring their deeds.
And many of those who practiced curious arts brought their books together and burned them in the sight of all; and they counted the prices of them and found it to be fifty thousand pieces of silver.
Thus, the word of the Lord grew mightily and prevailed.
After these events had taken place, Paul felt compelled in the Spirit to go through Macedonia and Achaia and then proceed to Jerusalem, declaring that after I have been there, it is necessary for me to see Rome as well.
He sent two of his companions, Timothy and Erastus, to Macedonia, while he himself remained for a time longer in Asia.
And at that time, there arose no small commotion concerning the way.
For a certain man named Demetrius, a silversmith, who made silver shrines of Artemis, brought no little gain to the craftsmen.
Gathering them together, he said, "Men, you know that our prosperity comes from this trade.
And you see and hear that not only in Ephesus, but almost throughout all of Asia, this Paul has persuaded and turned away a considerable number of people, saying that they are not gods which are made by hands.
Not only is there a risk that our business may fall into disrepute, but also that the temple of the great goddess Artemis will be regarded as nothing, and that she, whom all of Asia and the world worship, will be brought to nothing.
When they heard this and became filled with rage, they began shouting, "Great is Artemis of the Ephesians!"
And the whole city was filled with confusion; and they rushed together into the theater, dragging along Gaius and Aristarchus, Macedonians who were companions of Paul.
But when Paul wanted to enter the assembly, the disciples would not let him.
Yet some of the Asiarchs, who were his friends, sent to him and urged him not to venture into the theater.
So then, some were shouting one thing and others were shouting another, for the assembly was in confusion, and the majority did not know why they had come together.
From the crowd, they pushed forward Alexander, whom the Jews had put forward; and Alexander, waving his hand, wanted to make a defense to the people.
But when they recognized that he was a Jew, a single outcry arose from them all, as they shouted for about two hours, "Great is Artemis of the Ephesians!"
But when the town clerk had quieted the crowd, he said: 'Men of Ephesus, what person is there who does not know that the city of the Ephesians is the keeper of the temple of the great goddess Artemis and of the image that fell from Zeus?'
Therefore, since these things are indisputable, it is necessary for you to remain calm and not act hastily.
For you have brought these men here who are neither sacrilegious nor are they blaspheming your goddess.
So if Demetrius and the craftsmen who are with him have a complaint against anyone, the courts are open and there are proconsuls; let them bring charges against one another.
But if you seek anything further, it shall be resolved in the lawful assembly.
For we are in danger of being charged with a riot today, since there is no legitimate reason for this commotion we are unable to justify.
After the uproar had ceased, Paul called the disciples to himself and, after encouraging them, took his leave to go to Macedonia.
When he had gone through those regions and had given them much encouragement, he came to Greece.
After spending three months there, and facing a plot against him by the Jews as he was about to sail to Syria, he decided to return through Macedonia.
He was accompanied by Sopater, a Berean; Aristarchus and Secundus from Thessalonica; Gaius from Derbe; Timothy; and the Asians, Tychicus and Trophimus.
These men went on ahead and waited for us at Troas.
But we sailed away from Philippi after the days of Unleavened Bread, and came to them at Troas within five days, where we stayed for seven days.
On the first day of the week, when we gathered together to break bread, Paul spoke to them, intending to depart the next day, and he prolonged his message until midnight.
And there were many lamps in the upper room where we were gathered together.
And a certain young man named Eutychus, sitting in a window, fell into a deep sleep as Paul spoke on and on. Being overcome by sleep, he fell down from the third story and was picked up dead.
But Paul went down, fell upon him, and embracing him said, "Do not be troubled, for his life is still in him."
Then Paul went back upstairs, broke bread, and shared a meal with them. He spoke with them for a considerable time, until daylight, and then departed.
They brought the boy alive, and they were greatly comforted.
We, however, went ahead to the ship and set sail for Assos, intending to take Paul on board there; for so he had arranged, since he was going there on foot.
When he joined us at Assos, we took him on board and sailed on to Mytilene.
From there, we set sail, and the following day we arrived opposite Chios; we then sailed past Chios and landed at Samos, and after staying at Trogyllium, we came to Miletus.
For Paul had decided to sail past Ephesus, so that he would not spend time in Asia; for he was hurrying to be in Jerusalem, if possible, by the day of Pentecost.
From Miletus, he sent to Ephesus and called for the elders of the church.
And when they came to him, he said to them, 'You yourselves know how from the very first day I set foot in Asia, I was with you at all times.'
Serving the Lord with complete humility and with tears, and enduring trials that came upon me from the plots of the Jews.
How I did not hold back from proclaiming to you anything that was beneficial, nor did I cease to teach you publicly and from house to house.
Testifying both to Jews and to Greeks of repentance toward God and of faith in our Lord Jesus Christ.
And now, behold, I am compelled by the Spirit to go to Jerusalem, not knowing what will happen to me there.
However, I know that the Holy Spirit testifies to me in every city that chains and tribulations await me.
But I do not consider my life worth anything to me; my only aim is to finish the race and complete the ministry I received from the Lord Jesus, the task of testifying to the gospel of God’s grace.
And now, behold, I know that you will no longer see my face, all of you among whom I have gone about proclaiming the kingdom of God.
Therefore, I testify to you today that I am innocent of the blood of all men.
For I did not shrink from declaring to you the entire will of God.
Take heed to yourselves and to all the flock, in which the Holy Spirit has made you overseers, to shepherd the church of the Lord and God, which He purchased with His own blood.
For I know this: that after my departure, fierce wolves will come in among you, not sparing the flock.
And from among your own selves will arise men speaking twisted things, to draw away the disciples after them.
Therefore, be on guard, remembering that for three years I did not cease, night and day, to admonish each one of you with tears.
And now I commend you, brothers, to God and to the word of His grace, which is able to build you up and to give you an inheritance among all those who are sanctified.
I have not coveted anyone's silver or gold or clothing.
You yourselves know that these hands have provided for my own needs and for those who were with me.
In everything I showed you that by working hard we must help the weak and remember the words of the Lord Jesus, for he himself said, 'It is more blessed to give than to receive.'
And when he had said these things, he knelt down with all of them and prayed.
And there was a great outpouring of tears from all, and they fell upon Paul’s neck and kissed him.
They were especially grieved by the word he had spoken, that they would see his face no more. And they accompanied him to the ship.
And when we had parted from them and set sail, we came straight to the island of Cos, and the next day to Rhodes, and from there to Patara.
And finding a ship sailing to Phoenicia, we went aboard and set sail.
After we had seen Cyprus and left it on our left, we sailed on to Syria, and landed at Tyre; for there the ship was unloading its cargo.
Finding the disciples there, we stayed with them for seven days. They urged Paul through the Spirit not to go up to Jerusalem.
But when our days there were ended, we departed, with all of them—including their wives and children—accompanying us until we were outside the city. After kneeling down on the shore, we prayed.
And after greeting one another, we boarded the ship, while they returned to their own homes.
But we had completed our voyage from Tyre and arrived at Ptolemais; and after greeting the brethren, we stayed with them for one day.
The next day, we departed and came to Caesarea, and entering the house of Philip the evangelist, who was one of the seven, we remained with him.
And he had four unmarried daughters who prophesied.
While we were staying there for several days, a prophet named Agabus came down from Judea.
And when he had come to us, he took Paul’s belt and bound his own feet and hands, saying, ‘Thus says the Holy Spirit: So shall the Jews at Jerusalem bind the man whose belt this is and deliver him into the hands of the Gentiles.’
When we heard this, both we and the local disciples urged him not to go up to Jerusalem.
Then Paul answered, "What are you doing, weeping and breaking my heart? For I am ready not only to be bound, but also to die in Jerusalem for the name of the Lord Jesus."
And since he would not be persuaded, we ceased our urging, saying, 'Let the will of the Lord be done.'
And after these days, we made preparations and ascended to Jerusalem.
And some of the disciples from Caesarea also came with us, bringing us to a man named Mnason, a Cypriot of ancient standing, one of the early disciples.
And when we arrived in Jerusalem, the brethren received us gladly.
The following day, Paul went in with us to see James, and all the elders were present.
And after greeting them, he reported in detail everything that God had done among the Gentiles through his ministry.
And when they heard it, they glorified the Lord. And they said to him, "You see, brother, how many thousands there are among the Jews of those who have believed. They are all zealous for the Law."
They have been informed about you, that you teach all the Jews among the Gentiles to abandon Moses, telling them not to circumcise their children or to walk according to the customs.
What then must be done? A multitude must certainly come together, for they will hear that you have arrived.
Therefore, do this that we tell you: We have four men here who have taken a vow upon themselves.
Take these men, purify yourself along with them, and bear the cost for them to have their heads shaved, so that all may know that there is nothing in what they have been told about you, but that you yourself also live in observance of the Law.
As for the believers from the Gentiles, we have sent them our decision that they should abstain from the pollutions of idols, from blood, from anything that has been strangled, and from sexual immorality.
Then Paul took the men, and the next day, having purified himself along with them, he entered the temple, giving notice of the completion of the days of purification, until the offering was made for each one of them.
But as the seven days were about to come to an end, the Jews from Asia, having seen him in the temple, stirred up the entire crowd and laid hands on him.
Crying out, "Men of Israel, help! This is the man who is teaching everyone everywhere against the people, the Law, and this place. Moreover, he has brought Greeks into the temple and has defiled this holy place."
For they had seen Trophimus the Ephesian in the city with him, whom they supposed that Paul had brought into the temple.
And the whole city was stirred up, and a gathering of the people ensued; they seized Paul and dragged him out of the temple, and immediately the doors were closed.
As they were seeking to kill him, news reached the commander of the regiment that all Jerusalem was in an uproar.
He immediately took soldiers and centurions, and ran down to them. When they saw the commander and the soldiers, they stopped beating Paul.
Then the commander approached, seized him, and ordered him to be bound with two chains. He began to inquire who he was and what he had done.
But others were shouting different things in the crowd. And since he could not ascertain the truth because of the uproar, he commanded that he be taken into the barracks.
And as they were about to take him up the steps, it happened that he was carried by the soldiers due to the violence of the crowd.
For the crowd followed, crying out, "Remove him!"
As Paul was about to be brought into the barracks, he said to the commander, "May I say something to you?" The commander replied, "Can you speak Greek?"
Then the commander said, 'Aren’t you the Egyptian who stirred up trouble some time ago and led four thousand assassins out into the wilderness?'
But Paul said, 'I am a man, a Jew from Tarsus in Cilicia, a city of no insignificant reputation; I implore you, allow me to speak to the people.'
When he had given him permission, Paul, standing on the steps, motioned with his hand to the people. And when there was a great silence, he spoke to them in the Hebrew language, saying,
Brothers and fathers, hear my defense before you now.
And when they heard that he spoke to them in the Hebrew language, they became even more silent.
I am indeed a Jew, born in Tarsus of Cilicia, but brought up in this city at the feet of Gamaliel, instructed according to the exactness of our ancestral law, being zealous for God, just as all of you are today.
I persecuted this way to the death, binding and delivering both men and women into prisons.
as the high priest and all the council of elders can bear witness. From them, I received letters to the brothers in Damascus, and I was on my way to bring those who were there bound to Jerusalem to be punished.
And as I was traveling and drawing near to Damascus, about noon, suddenly a great light shone around me from heaven.
I fell to the ground and heard a voice saying to me, ‘Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting me?’
And I answered, ‘Who are you, Lord?’ And he said to me, ‘I am Jesus of Nazareth, whom you are persecuting.'
Those who were with me saw the light and were filled with fear, but they did not hear the voice of the one who spoke to me.
I said, 'What shall I do, Lord?' And the Lord said to me, 'Rise and go to Damascus, and there it will be told you all that is appointed for you to do.'
But since I could not see because of the glory of that light, I was led by the hand by those who were with me and came into Damascus.
And there was a certain man named Ananias, a devout man according to the law, well-regarded by all the Jews living in Damascus.
He came to me, and standing beside me, he said, 'Saul, my brother, receive your sight.' At that very moment, I regained my sight and looked up at him.
And he said, 'The God of our fathers has appointed you to know His will and to see the Righteous One, and to hear a voice from His mouth,'.
For you will be a witness for Him to all men of what you have seen and heard.
And now, what are you waiting for? Rise up, be baptized, and wash away your sins, calling on the name of the Lord.
When I returned to Jerusalem and was praying in the temple, I fell into a trance and saw Him saying to me,
Make haste and quickly leave Jerusalem, because they will not accept your testimony concerning Me.
And I said, 'Lord, they know that I was imprisoning and beating those who believed in You in the synagogues.'
And when the blood of Your witness Stephen was shed, I stood by and approved of his execution, guarding the garments of those who killed him.
And He said to me, ‘Go, for I will send you far away to the Gentiles.’
And they listened to him until he said this word; then they lifted up their voices and shouted, 'Away with such a fellow from the earth! For he is not fit to live.'
As they shouted and tossed aside their garments, throwing dust into the air,
The commander ordered him to be taken into the barracks, instructing that he should be examined by scourging, to determine the reason for the outcry against him.
But when they stretched him out with the thongs, Paul said to the centurion standing by, "Is it lawful for you to scourge a man who is a Roman citizen and uncondemned?"
When the centurion heard this, he went and reported to the commander, saying, "Take care what you are about to do, for this man is a Roman citizen."
The commander approached Paul and asked, "Tell me, are you a Roman citizen?" And he said, "Yes."
The commander replied, "I acquired this citizenship with a great sum of money." But Paul said, "I was born a citizen."
Immediately those who were about to examine him withdrew from him, and the commander was afraid when he realized that Paul was a Roman citizen, and that he had bound him.
But on the next day, wanting to know the certainty of the charges being brought against him by the Jews, he unbound him and commanded the chief priests and all their council to come together; and he brought Paul down and set him before them.
Looking intently at the council, Paul said, 'Men, brothers, I have lived my life before God in all good conscience up to this day.'
But the high priest Ananias commanded those standing by him to strike him on the mouth.
Then Paul said to him, "God will strike you, you whitewashed wall! Are you sitting to judge me according to the Law, and yet contrary to the Law you order me to be struck?"
And those who stood by said, "Do you revile the high priest of God?"
Paul said, "I did not know, brothers, that he is the high priest; for it is written, ‘You shall not speak evil of a ruler of your people.’"
But when Paul perceived that one part of them were Sadducees and the other part were Pharisees, he cried out in the council, 'Men, brothers, I am a Pharisee, a son of Pharisees. I am being judged for the hope and resurrection of the dead.'
As he said this, a division arose between the Pharisees and the Sadducees, and the assembly was divided.
For the Sadducees say that there is no resurrection, nor angel, nor spirit; but the Pharisees acknowledge both resurrection and angels.
And a great uproar arose, and the scribes of the Pharisees' party stood up and argued, saying, 'We find no evil in this man; but if a spirit has spoken to him or an angel, let us not fight against God.'
And when there arose a great dissension, fearing that Paul would be torn to pieces by them, the commander ordered the troops to go down and take him by force from their midst and bring him into the barracks.
But on the following night, the Lord stood near him and said, 'Take courage, Paul; for as you have testified about Me in Jerusalem, so you must also testify in Rome.'
When morning came, some of the Jews formed a conspiracy and bound themselves under an oath, saying that they would neither eat nor drink until they had killed Paul.
More than forty men were involved in this conspiracy.
These men approached the chief priests and the elders and said, 'We have solemnly bound ourselves by a curse to taste nothing until we have killed Paul.'
Now therefore, you and the council make known to the tribune that he should bring him down to you tomorrow, as though you were going to examine more closely the matters concerning him. And we are ready to kill him before he comes near.
But when Paul's sister's son heard of their ambush, he went and entered the barracks and told Paul.
Then Paul called one of the centurions and said, 'Take this young man to the commander, for he has something to report to him.'
So the soldier, taking him, led him to the commander, and said, 'The prisoner Paul called for me and asked me to bring this young man to you, for he has something to say to you.'
The commander, taking hold of his hand, withdrew privately and asked him, 'What is it that you have to tell me?'
He said that the Jews had agreed to ask you to bring Paul down to the council tomorrow, as they were planning to inquire about him more thoroughly.
But do not be persuaded by them; for more than forty men are lying in wait for him, who have bound themselves by an oath neither to eat nor drink until they have killed him. And now they are ready, waiting for your promise.
So the commander let the young man go, instructing him not to tell anyone what he had disclosed to him.
And having summoned two of the centurions, he said to them, 'Prepare two hundred soldiers to go to Caesarea, along with seventy horsemen and two hundred spearmen, to depart at the third hour of the night.'
And provide mounts for him, that he may be safely brought to Felix the governor.
He composed a letter that contained the following message:
Claudius Lysias sends greetings to the most excellent Governor Felix.
This man was seized by the Jews and was about to be killed by them, but when I came with the soldiers and rescued him, I found out that he was a Roman citizen.
Desiring to understand the cause for which they accused him, I brought him down to their council.
I found him being accused concerning their law; but he had committed nothing worthy of death or imprisonment.
But when I learned of a conspiracy against the man, intending to kill him by the Jews, I immediately sent him to you, and instructed his accusers to speak the charges against him before you. Farewell.
So the soldiers, taking charge as they had been commanded, brought Paul safely through the night to Antipatris.
But the next day, after allowing the horsemen to proceed with him, they returned to the barracks.
When they arrived at Caesarea and delivered the letter to the governor, they also presented Paul to him.
When the governor read it and asked what province Paul was from, and learning that he was from Cilicia,
He said, 'I will give you a hearing when your accusers arrive.' And he commanded that he be kept under guard in Herod's palace.
Now after five days, the high priest Ananias came down with some of the elders and a certain orator named Tertullus. They presented their case against Paul before the governor.
When he was called, Tertullus began to accuse him, saying:
In every way and everywhere, we acknowledge this, most excellent Felix, with all gratitude, for the great peace we enjoy through you and for the successes that have come to this nation by your providential care.
But in order not to hinder you any further, I beg you to listen to us briefly with your characteristic kindness.
For we have found this man to be a plague and a stirrer of dissension among all the Jews throughout the world, and he is the ringleader of the sect of the Nazarenes.
He even attempted to profane the temple, and we seized him, intending to judge him according to our law.
But Lysias the commander came and took him from us with great violence.
Commanding his accusers to come before you, and by examining him yourself, you will be able to learn about all these things of which we accuse him.
The Jews also joined in the accusation, affirming that these things were so.
Then Paul, after the governor had signaled for him to speak, answered: "Since you have been a judge over this nation for many years, I cheerfully make my defense regarding these accusations against me.
You can verify for yourself that I have been in Jerusalem for no more than twelve days since I went there to worship.
And neither did they find me in the temple disputing with anyone, nor stirring up a crowd in the synagogues or throughout the city.
Nor can they prove the things of which they now accuse me.
But I confess to you this: according to the way which they call a sect, I worship the God of my fathers, believing everything laid down in the Law and written in the Prophets.
Having hope in God, which these men themselves also accept, that there will be a resurrection of both the just and the unjust.
So I strive always to keep my conscience clear before God and man.
Now after several years, I came to bring charitable gifts and offerings to my nation.
In which they found me purified in the temple, not with a crowd nor in confusion, but rather certain Jews from Asia.
Those who should have been here to stand against you and accuse me, if they had anything against me.
Or let these men themselves declare what wrongdoing they found in me while I stood before the council.
except for this one statement, which I cried out while standing among them, that I am judged today for the hope of the resurrection of the dead.
But when Felix heard these things, he postponed their hearing, being more informed about the way, saying, 'When Lysias the tribune comes down, I will make a decision concerning your case.'
Then he ordered the centurion to let Paul have some liberty, and he commanded that no one should prevent his friends from attending to his needs.
After some days, Felix came with his wife Drusilla, who was Jewish. He sent for Paul and listened to him speak about faith in Christ.
As Paul spoke about righteousness, self-control, and the coming judgment, Felix became afraid and replied, "Go away for now; when I find it convenient, I will summon you."
At the same time, he hoped that money would be given to him by Paul, so he frequently sent for him and talked with him.
But when two years had passed, Felix was succeeded by Porcius Festus. Wanting to do the Jews a favor, Felix left Paul in prison.
Therefore, when Festus had arrived in the province after three days, he went up to Jerusalem from Caesarea.
Then the high priest and the prominent leaders of the Jews brought their accusations against Paul before Festus, earnestly requesting him.
They were asking him for a favor concerning Paul, to have him transferred to Jerusalem, while they were planning an ambush to kill him along the way.
But Festus answered that Paul was to be kept in custody at Caesarea, and that he himself was about to go there shortly.
Therefore, let those who are influential among you, he said, go down with me, and if there is anything wrong with this man, let them bring their charges against him.
After spending more than ten days among them, he went down to Caesarea; and the next day, sitting on the judgment seat, he commanded that Paul be brought before him.
When he arrived, the Jews who had come down from Jerusalem stood around him, bringing many and serious charges against Paul, which they could not prove.
While he made his defense, he declared, 'I have committed no offense against the law of the Jews, nor against the temple, nor against Caesar.'
But Festus, wishing to grant the Jews a favor, replied to Paul, 'Are you willing to go up to Jerusalem and be tried there before me concerning these matters?'
But Paul said, 'I stand at Caesar's judgment seat, where I ought to be tried. I have done no wrong to the Jews, as you very well know.'
For if I have committed any wrong, or have done anything deserving of death, I do not refuse to die. But if there is nothing to the charges these men bring against me, no one can hand me over to them. I appeal to Caesar!
Then Festus, having conferred with the council, answered, 'To Caesar you have appealed; to Caesar you shall go.'
Now after some days had passed, King Agrippa and Bernice arrived in Caesarea to pay their respects to Festus.
As they spent more days there, Festus laid before the king the matters concerning Paul, saying, "A man is being held in custody by Felix."
When I arrived in Jerusalem, the chief priests and the elders of the Jews presented their case against him, asking for a verdict.
To them I replied that it is not the custom of Romans to hand over any man for destruction before the accused has the opportunity to face his accusers and make a defense concerning the charges.
So when they had come together here, I made no delay, but sitting on the judgment seat, I ordered the man to be brought before me.
When the accusers stood up, they did not bring any charge of the evil that I had expected.
But they had certain disputes with him about their own superstitions and about a Jesus who had died, whom Paul asserted to be alive.
But I, being perplexed about this inquiry, asked whether he would be willing to go to Jerusalem and there be tried concerning these matters.
But when Paul appealed to be kept for the examination of the Emperor, I commanded him to be guarded until I could send him to Caesar.
Then Agrippa said to Festus, 'I would also like to hear this man myself.' Festus replied, 'Tomorrow you shall hear him.'
So on the next day, when Agrippa and Bernice had come with great pomp and had entered the auditorium with the commanders and the prominent men of the city, Festus commanded that Paul be brought in.
And Festus said, "King Agrippa, and all you gentlemen present with us, you see this man about whom the whole Jewish multitude has petitioned me, both in Jerusalem and here, shouting that he ought not to live any longer."
But I, having found nothing deserving of death in him, and when he himself had appealed to Augustus, I decided to send him.
I have nothing concrete to write to my lord regarding him; therefore, I have brought him before you, especially before you, King Agrippa, so that after this examination has taken place, I may have something to write.
For it seems unreasonable to me to send a prisoner without specifying the charges against him.
Then Agrippa said to Paul, "You are permitted to speak for yourself." At that moment, Paul stretched out his hand and began his defense.
I consider myself fortunate, King Agrippa, that I am about to make my defense today against all the accusations brought against me by the Jews.
especially since you are well acquainted with all the customs and controversies of the Jews; therefore, I ask you to listen patiently to my defense.
So then, all the Jews are aware of my manner of life from my youth, which was spent from the very beginning among my own people in Jerusalem.
They have known me for a long time, if they are willing to testify, that according to the most precise sect of our religion, I lived as a Pharisee.
And now I stand here on trial because of the hope of the promise made by God to our ancestors.
To this hope, our twelve tribes earnestly serve God day and night, and it is for this hope that I am being accused by the Jews, O King Agrippa.
Why is it considered incredible by any of you that God raises the dead?
I myself had once thought it necessary to act in many ways against the name of Jesus of Nazareth.
This is what I did in Jerusalem; I not only locked many of the saints in prison with the authority I received from the chief priests, but when they were put to death, I cast my vote against them.
And in every synagogue, I punished them often, forcing them to blaspheme; and in my rage against them, I relentlessly pursued them even to foreign cities.
In this connection, while traveling to Damascus with authority and commission from the chief priests,
At midday, O King, along the road, I saw a light from heaven, brighter than the brightness of the sun, shining around me and those who journeyed with me.
And when we all had fallen to the ground, I heard a voice speaking to me and saying in the Hebrew language, 'Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting me? It is hard for you to resist what is right and true.'
Then I asked, 'Who are you, Lord?' And the Lord replied, 'I am Jesus, whom you are persecuting.'
But rise up and stand on your feet; for I have appeared to you for this purpose, to appoint you as a servant and a witness of both the things you have seen and the things I will show you.
Delivering you from your own people and from the nations, to whom I am sending you.
To open their eyes, so that they may turn from darkness to light and from the power of Satan to God, that they may receive forgiveness of sins and a share among those who are sanctified by faith in me.
Therefore, King Agrippa, I was not disobedient to the heavenly vision.
but to those in Damascus first, and in Jerusalem, and throughout all the region of Judea, and to the Gentiles, I declared that they should repent and turn to God, performing deeds in keeping with repentance.
For this reason, the Jews seized me in the temple and attempted to kill me.
Therefore, having obtained help from God, I stand here to this day witnessing to both small and great, saying nothing other than what the prophets and Moses have said would happen.
That the Christ would suffer, and being the first to rise from the dead, He would proclaim light to the people and to the Gentiles.
As he thus made his defense, Festus said with a loud voice, "Paul, you are beside yourself; much learning is driving you mad!"
But he said, "I am not mad, most noble Festus, but I speak words of truth and soundness of mind."
For the king knows about these things, to whom I speak freely; for I am convinced that nothing of these matters escapes his notice, for this has not been done in a corner.
Do you believe, King Agrippa, in the prophets? I know that you believe.
Agrippa replied to Paul, 'In such a short time, are you trying to persuade me to become a Christian?'
Paul replied, "I wish before God that whether in a short time or a long time, not only you but all who hear me today might become such as I am, except for these chains."
And when he had said these things, the king rose, and the governor, and Bernice, and those who were sitting with them.
And after they had departed, they spoke to one another, saying, "This man has done nothing deserving of death or imprisonment."
Agrippa said to Festus, 'This man could have been set free if he had not appealed to Caesar.'
When it was decided that we would sail to Italy, they delivered Paul and some other prisoners to a centurion named Julius, of the Augustan cohort.
Boarding a ship from Adramyttium that was set to sail to the regions along Asia, we put out to sea, accompanied by Aristarchus, a Macedonian from Thessalonica.
The next day we arrived at Sidon; and Julius, treating Paul kindly, allowed him to go to his friends to receive care.
From there we set sail, and we passed by Cyprus because the winds were against us.
And when we had sailed across the sea off Cilicia and Pamphylia, we came down to Myra of Lycia.
And there the centurion found an Alexandrian ship sailing to Italy, and he put us on board.
And after several days of slow sailing, we finally came to Cnidus, with the wind not permitting us to proceed; so we passed along the southern side of Crete, near Salmone.
With great difficulty we arrived at a place called Beautiful Harbors, near the city of Lasea.
When considerable time had passed and the voyage was already dangerous because the Fast had already gone by, Paul advised them.
Saying to them, 'Men, I perceive that the voyage will be with great hardship and much loss, not only of the cargo and the ship, but also of our lives.'
But the centurion was more persuaded by the pilot and the ship's owner than by what Paul said.
But since the harbor was unsuitable for wintering, most advised to set sail from there, hoping to reach Phoenix, a harbor of Crete facing southwest and northwest, where they could spend the winter.
When the south wind blew softly, supposing they had obtained their purpose, they weighed anchor and sailed close to Crete.
But shortly thereafter, a tempestuous wind, called Euroclydon, struck down upon them.
When the ship was caught and could not withstand the wind, we let her be driven.
As we ran under the shelter of a small island called Clauda, we scarcely were able to secure the lifeboat.
After hoisting it up, they used supports to secure the ship, fearing they might run aground on the shallows of Syrtis; so they lowered the gear and thus were driven along.
And as we were violently tossed about by the storm, the next day they began to jettison cargo.
On the third day, we threw the ship's tackle overboard with our own hands.
For many days neither sun nor stars appeared, and the storm continued raging. We finally gave up all hope of being saved.
After they had gone a long time without food, Paul stood up among them and said: "Men, you should have taken my advice not to sail from Crete; then you would have spared yourselves this damage and loss."
And now I urge you to take heart; for there will be no loss of life among you, but only of the ship.
For this night, an angel of God stood beside me, the God to whom I belong and serve.
saying, 'Do not be afraid, Paul; you must stand trial before Caesar. And behold, God has graciously given you the lives of all who sail with you.'
Therefore, take heart, men; for I believe God that it will be just as it was told to me.
But we must run aground on some island.
But when the fourteenth night had come, as we were being driven across the Adriatic Sea, about midnight the sailors began to suspect that they were nearing some land.
And taking soundings, they found twenty fathoms; and when they had gone a little further, they sounded again and found fifteen fathoms.
Fearing that we might run aground on rocky shores, they cast four anchors from the stern and prayed for day to come.
As the sailors were trying to escape from the ship, they lowered the lifeboat into the sea, pretending that they were about to drop anchors from the bow.
Paul said to the centurion and the soldiers, "Unless these men stay aboard the ship, you cannot be saved."
Then the soldiers cut the ropes of the lifeboat and let it fall away.
Just before dawn, Paul urged everyone to take some food, saying, "This is the fourteenth day that you have been in suspense and without food; you must eat something to sustain yourselves. You cannot go on like this."
Therefore, I urge you to partake of some food; this is essential for your survival, for not a hair on the head of any of you will perish.
After saying this, he took bread, gave thanks to God in front of everyone, and broke it, beginning to eat.
So they all were encouraged and took food themselves.
And there were in the ship a total of two hundred seventy-six souls.
When they had eaten enough, they lightened the ship by throwing the wheat into the sea.
When day came, they did not recognize the land; but they observed a bay with a sandy beach, into which they planned, if possible, to run the ship aground.
So they cut the anchors loose and left them in the sea, while at the same time they untied the ropes of the rudders; then, hoisting the sail to the wind, they made for the shore.
But when they fell into a place where two seas meet, they ran the ship aground; the bow remained immovable, but the stern was being broken up by the force of the waves.
But the soldiers’ plan was to kill the prisoners, lest any of them should swim away and escape.
But the centurion, wishing to save Paul, kept them from carrying out their plan. He ordered those who could swim to jump overboard first and make for the land.
And the rest, some on boards and some on pieces of the ship. And so it came to pass that all were brought safely to land.
And after we were safely brought through, we recognized that the island was called Melita.
The islanders showed us extraordinary kindness; they built a fire and welcomed us all because it was raining and cold.
But when Paul had gathered a bundle of sticks and laid them on the fire, a viper came out because of the heat and fastened on his hand.
When the natives saw the creature hanging from his hand, they said to one another, 'Surely this man is a murderer! Though he escaped the sea, Justice has not allowed him to live.'
But he shook off the creature into the fire and suffered no harm.
But they were waiting for him to swell up or suddenly fall dead; but after they had waited a long time and saw no harm come to him, they changed their minds and said that he was a god.
In the region surrounding that place, there was an estate belonging to Publius, the chief official of the island. He welcomed us and entertained us hospitably for three days.
And it happened that the father of Publius lay sick with fever and dysentery. Paul went in to him and prayed, and he laid his hands on him and healed him.
So when this had happened, the rest of those on the island who had diseases came to him and were healed.
They also honored us with many honors; and when we departed, they loaded us with supplies for our needs.
After three months, we set sail on an Alexandrian ship that had wintered at the island, adorned with the figurehead of the Dioscuri.
And after landing at Syracuse, we stayed there for three days.
From there we sailed around and arrived at Rhegium. After one day, a gentle south wind began to blow, and the next day we reached Puteoli.
There we found brothers, and they invited us to stay with them for seven days. And so we came to Rome.
And from there, the brothers, having heard about us, came out to meet us as far as the Forum of Appius and the Three Taverns. When Paul saw them, he gave thanks to God and took courage.
When we arrived in Rome, the centurion delivered the prisoners to the commander of the guard; but Paul was allowed to remain by himself, with the soldier who guarded him.
After three days, Paul called together the prominent Jews in Rome. When they had gathered, he said to them, "Brothers, although I have done nothing against our people or the customs of our ancestors, I was delivered as a prisoner from Jerusalem into the hands of the Romans."
When they had examined me, they wanted to release me, because they found no reason for any death penalty against me.
But when the Jews opposed me, I was compelled to appeal to Caesar, not because I had any accusation against my nation.
It is for this reason that I have requested to see you and to speak with you; for it is because of the hope of Israel that I am bound with this chain.
But they said to him, 'We have received no letters concerning you from Judea, nor has any of the brethren come here to report or to speak anything evil about you.'
But we desire to hear from you what your views are; for concerning this sect, we know that everywhere it is spoken against.
And when they had appointed a day for him, many came to him at his lodging; he was explaining to them, testifying about the kingdom of God, and trying to persuade them concerning Jesus from both the Law of Moses and the Prophets, from morning until evening.
And some were convinced by what he said, while others refused to believe.
But as they disagreed with one another, they began to depart after Paul had spoken this one word: 'The Holy Spirit rightly spoke through the prophet Isaiah to your fathers, saying...'
Go to this people and say: 'You will hear but not understand, and you will see but not perceive.'
For the heart of this people has become dull, and with their ears they scarcely hear, and they have closed their eyes; otherwise they might see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their heart, and turn, and I would heal them.
Therefore, be it known to you that this salvation of God has been sent to the Gentiles; they will indeed listen.
And when he had said these things, the Jews departed, having a great dispute among themselves.
And Paul stayed two whole years in his own rented house, and welcomed all who came to him.
Proclaiming the kingdom of God and teaching the things concerning the Lord Jesus Christ with all boldness, unhindered.
Paul, a servant of Jesus Christ, called to be an apostle, set apart for the Gospel of God.
Which He promised beforehand through His prophets in the holy Scriptures.
concerning His Son, who was born of the seed of David according to the flesh,
who was appointed the Son of God with power according to the Spirit of holiness by the resurrection from the dead, Jesus Christ our Lord.
Through whom we have received grace and apostleship for the obedience of faith among all nations for the sake of His name.
Among whom you also are the called of Jesus Christ.
To all those in Rome who are loved by God and called to be saints: Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
First, I thank my God through Jesus Christ for all of you, because your faith is being proclaimed throughout the whole world.
For God is my witness, whom I serve in my spirit in preaching the gospel of His Son, that without ceasing I make mention of you in my prayers.
Always in my prayers, I am pleading that somehow by God's will, I may now at last succeed in coming to you.
For I long to see you, so that I may impart to you some spiritual gift to strengthen you.
that is, that we may be mutually encouraged by each other’s faith, both yours and mine.
Now, I do not want you to be unaware, brothers, that I have often intended to come to you, but have been hindered until now, in order that I might reap some fruit among you, just as I have among the other nations.
I am under obligation both to Greeks and to non-Greeks, both to the wise and to the foolish.
So I am eager to preach the gospel to you also who are in Rome.
For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ, for it is the power of God for salvation to everyone who believes, to the Jew first and also to the Greek.
For in it the righteousness of God is revealed from faith to faith; as it is written, "The just shall live by faith."
For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men who suppress the truth in unrighteousness.
For what can be known about God is plain to them, because God has shown it to them.
For since the creation of the world, God’s invisible qualities—his eternal power and divine nature—have been clearly seen, being understood from what has been made, so that people are without excuse.
For although they knew God, they did not glorify Him as God, nor did they give thanks; instead, their thoughts became futile, and their foolish hearts were darkened.
Claiming to be wise, they became fools.
And they exchanged the glory of the incorruptible God for images resembling corruptible man and birds and animals and creeping things.
Therefore God gave them up to the lusts of their hearts, to impurity, so that their bodies would be dishonored among themselves.
They exchanged the truth of God for falsehood and worshipped and served created things instead of the Creator, who is blessed forever. Amen.
For this reason, God gave them up to dishonorable passions. For their women exchanged the natural function for that which is contrary to nature.
And likewise, the men, having abandoned the natural use of women, burned with desire for one another, men committing shameless acts with men and receiving in themselves the due penalty for their error.
And since they did not consider it worthwhile to hold onto the knowledge of God, God gave them over to a mind that is unapproved, to carry out those things that are not proper.
They were filled with all manner of unrighteousness, sexual immorality, wickedness, greed, and malice; they were full of envy, murder, strife, deceit, and maliciousness.
They are whisperers, slanderers, haters of God, insolent, haughty, boastful, inventors of evil, disobedient to parents.
They are senseless, faithless, heartless, merciless.
Though they know the righteous decree of God, that those who practice such things deserve death, they not only continue to do these very things but also approve of those who practice them.
Therefore, you are without excuse, O man, everyone who judges; for in judging another, you condemn yourself, since you practice the very same things.
But we know that the judgment of God is according to truth against those who practice such things.
And do you think, O man, that you will escape the judgment of God when you judge those who commit such acts and yet do the same things yourself?
Or do you show contempt for the riches of His kindness, forbearance, and patience, not realizing that God’s kindness is intended to lead you to repentance?
But because of your stubbornness and unrepentant heart, you are storing up wrath for yourself on the day of wrath when God’s righteous judgment will be revealed.
He will repay each person according to their deeds.
To those who by perseverance in doing good seek glory, honor, and immortality, He will give eternal life.
But for those who are self-seeking and do not obey the truth but obey unrighteousness, there will be wrath and indignation.
There will be tribulation and distress for every human soul that does evil, for the Jew first and also for the Greek.
but glory and honor and peace to everyone who does good, to the Jew first and also to the Greek.
For there is no favoritism with God.
For all who have sinned without the Law will perish without the Law; and all who have sinned under the Law will be judged by the Law.
For it is not the hearers of the Law who are justified before God, but the doers of the Law will be justified.
For when Gentiles, who do not have the Law, by nature do what the Law requires, they are a law to themselves, even though they do not have the Law.
They demonstrate that the work of the law is written on their hearts, their conscience bearing witness to this, and their thoughts either accusing or defending them.
on the day when God judges the secrets of men by my gospel through Jesus Christ.
Indeed, you bear the name of Jew, and rely on the Law, and boast in your relationship with God.
and you know His will, and approve the things that are excellent, being instructed out of the Law,
You are confident that you can guide the blind, a light for those who are in darkness.
an instructor of the foolish, a teacher of children, having in the Law the embodiment of knowledge and truth.
You, therefore, who teach others, do you not teach yourself? You who preach against stealing, do you steal?
You who say, ‘Do not commit adultery,’ do you commit adultery? You who detest idols, do you rob temples?
You who boast in the Law, do you dishonor God by breaking the Law?
For the name of God is blasphemed among the nations because of you, as it is written.
For circumcision indeed has value if you practice the law; but if you are a transgressor of the law, your circumcision has become as if it were uncircumcision.
Therefore, if an uncircumcised man keeps the righteous requirements of the law, will not his uncircumcision be counted as circumcision?
And the one who is physically uncircumcised but fulfills the law will judge you, who possess the law written and the sign of circumcision, yet still violate the law.
For he is not a Jew who is merely one outwardly, nor is circumcision something external and physical.
But he is a Jew who is one inwardly, and circumcision is a matter of the heart, by the Spirit, not by the letter. His praise is not from man but from God.
What then is the advantage of the Jew, or what is the benefit of circumcision?
Much in every way. To begin with, they were entrusted with the very words of God.
What then, if some did not believe? Will their lack of faith nullify the faithfulness of God?
Far from it! Let God be true, and every person a liar, as it is written: "So that you may be justified in your words and prevail when you are judged."
But if our unrighteousness serves to highlight God's righteousness, what shall we say? Is God unjust to bring wrath upon us? (I speak in human terms.)
Absolutely not! For how could God judge the world if that were the case?
For if the truth of God shines more brightly through my falsehood, resulting in His glory, why then am I still judged as a sinner?
And why should we be slandered as saying, 'Let us do evil so that good may come'? Their condemnation is just.
What then? Are we better than they? Not at all; for we have already charged that both Jews and Greeks are all under sin.
As it is written: "There is no one righteous, not even one."
There is no one who understands; there is no one who seeks God.
All have turned away; they have become worthless together; there is no one who does good, not even one.
Their throat is an open grave; they deceive with their tongues; the venom of serpents is under their lips.
Their mouths are filled with curses and bitterness.
Their feet are swift to spill innocent blood.
Destruction and turmoil are in their paths.
And they have not known the way of peace.
There is no fear of God before their eyes.
Now we know that whatever the law says, it speaks to those who are under the law, so that every mouth may be silenced and the whole world may be accountable to God.
For by works of the law no flesh will be justified in His sight, for through the law comes the knowledge of sin.
But now, apart from the law, the righteousness of God has been made known, being witnessed by the Law and the Prophets.
The righteousness of God through faith in Jesus Christ is available to all and upon all who believe, for there is no distinction.
For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God.
being justified freely by His grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus.
Whom God set forth as an atoning sacrifice through faith in His blood, to demonstrate His righteousness, because of the forbearance shown toward the sins previously committed.
in the forbearance of God, to demonstrate His righteousness at the present time, so that He might be just and the justifier of the one who has faith in Jesus.
Where then is boasting? It has been excluded. By what kind of law? Not the law of works, but the law of faith.
Therefore, we conclude that a person is justified by faith apart from the works of the law.
Is God the God of Jews only? Is he not the God of Gentiles too? Yes, of Gentiles as well.
Since there is only one God, who will justify both the circumcised by faith and the uncircumcised through faith.
Do we then nullify the law through faith? Certainly not! On the contrary, we uphold the law.
What then shall we say about Abraham, our forefather according to the flesh?
For if Abraham was justified by works, he has something to boast about, but not before God.
For what does the Scripture say? "Abraham believed God, and it was credited to him as righteousness."
Now to the one who works, his wages are not counted as a gift, but as something owed.
But to the one who does not work but believes in Him who justifies the ungodly, his faith is counted as righteousness.
Just as David also speaks of the blessing of the one to whom God counts righteousness apart from works:
Blessed are those whose lawless deeds are forgiven, and whose sins are covered.
Blessed is the man whom the Lord will not reckon as guilty of sin.
Is this blessing then only for the circumcised, or also for the uncircumcised? For we say that faith was credited to Abraham as righteousness.
How then was it credited? Was it before or after he had been circumcised? It was not after, but before he was circumcised.
And he received a sign of circumcision, a seal of the righteousness of the faith which he had while uncircumcised, so that he might be the father of all who believe, though they are uncircumcised, so that righteousness might be credited to them as well.
and he is also the father of the circumcised who are not only circumcised but also walk in the footsteps of the faith that our father Abraham had while he was still uncircumcised.
For the promise to Abraham or to his offspring that he would be the heir of the world did not come through the law, but through the righteousness of faith.
For if those who are of the law are heirs, then faith is made void, and the promise is rendered powerless.
For the law brings about wrath; but where there is no law, there is no transgression.
Therefore, it is from faith, so that it may be by grace, in order that the promise may rest on sure ground for all of Abraham's descendants, not only for those who are of the law but also for those who share the faith of Abraham, who is the father of us all.
As it is written: "I have made you the father of many nations," in the presence of the God in whom he believed, who gives life to the dead and calls into existence the things that do not exist.
In hope against hope, he believed, so that he would become the father of many nations, as it had been said to him: ‘So shall your offspring be.’
And without being weak in faith, he did not consider his own body, already dead, since he was about a hundred years old, nor the deadness of Sarah's womb.
He did not waver in unbelief regarding the promise of God, but was strengthened in his faith, giving glory to God.
and being fully convinced that God was able to do what He had promised.
Therefore, his faith was credited to him as righteousness.
Now it was not written for his sake alone that it was credited to him,
but also for us, to whom God will credit righteousness—for us who believe in Him who raised Jesus our Lord from the dead.
He was delivered over because of our transgressions, and He was raised for our justification.
Therefore, having been justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ.
Through whom we have also obtained access by faith into this grace in which we stand, and we rejoice in the hope of the glory of God.
And not only that, but we also rejoice in our sufferings, knowing that suffering produces endurance,
and endurance produces tested character, and tested character produces hope.
And hope does not put us to shame, because God’s love has been poured into our hearts through the Holy Spirit who has been given to us.
For while we were still weak, at the appointed time Christ died for the ungodly.
For scarcely will someone die for a righteous person; though perhaps for a good person someone would dare even to die.
But God demonstrates His own love toward us, in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us.
Much more then, having now been justified by His blood, we shall be saved from wrath through Him.
For if while we were enemies, we were reconciled to God through the death of His Son, much more, having been reconciled, we shall be saved by His life.
And not only this, but we also exult in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we have now received reconciliation.
Therefore, just as sin entered the world through one man, and death through sin, so death spread to all people because all sinned.
For until the law, sin was in the world; but sin is not charged against anyone when there is no law.
Yet death reigned from Adam until Moses, even over those who had not sinned in the same way as Adam, who is a type of the One to come.
But the gift is not like the trespass. For if the many died by the trespass of one man, how much more did God’s grace and the gift that came by the grace of the one man, Jesus Christ, overflow to the many!
And the gift is not like the result of the one who sinned; for judgment arose from one sin, leading to condemnation, but the gift arose from many offenses, bringing justification.
For if, by the transgression of one, death reigned through that one man, how much more will those who receive the abundance of grace and the gift of righteousness reign in life through the one man, Jesus Christ!
Therefore, just as one transgression led to condemnation for all people, so one act of righteousness leads to justification and life for all people.
For just as through the disobedience of one man many were made sinners, so through the obedience of one man many will be made righteous.
Now, the law came in alongside to magnify the trespass. But where sin abounded, grace overflowed even more.
so that, just as sin reigned in death, grace might also reign through righteousness leading to eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.
What shall we say then? Shall we continue in sin so that grace may abound?
Absolutely not! How can we who have died to sin still live in it?
Or do you not know that as many of us as were baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into His death?
Therefore, we were buried with Him through baptism into death, so that, just as Christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the Father, we too might walk in newness of life.
For if we have been united with Him in the likeness of His death, we will certainly also be united with Him in the likeness of His resurrection.
Knowing this, that our old self was crucified with Him, in order that the body of sin might be made powerless, so that we would no longer be enslaved to sin.
For the one who has died has been justified from sin.
Now if we have died with Christ, we believe that we will also live with Him.
Knowing that Christ, having been raised from the dead, dies no more; death no longer has dominion over Him.
For in that He died, He died once for sin; but in that He lives, He lives to God.
Likewise, you also consider yourselves to be dead indeed to sin, but alive to God through Jesus Christ our Lord.
Therefore, do not let sin reign in your mortal body, that you should obey its desires.
And do not present your members as instruments of unrighteousness to sin, but present yourselves to God as those alive from the dead, and your members as instruments of righteousness to God.
For sin will not have dominion over you, for you are not under the law but under grace.
What then? Shall we sin because we are not under the law but under grace? May it never be!
Do you not know that to whom you present yourselves as obedient servants, you are slaves? Whether to sin, which leads to death, or to obedience, which leads to righteousness, you are slaves to whichever you obey.
But thanks be to God that though you were slaves to sin, you have wholeheartedly obeyed the form of teaching to which you were entrusted.
And having been set free from sin, you became servants of righteousness.
I speak in human terms because of your natural weakness. Just as you once presented your members as slaves to impurity and to lawlessness, leading to more lawlessness, so now present your members as slaves to righteousness, resulting in sanctification.
For when you were slaves to sin, you were free in regard to righteousness.
So what fruit did you have then in those things of which you are now ashamed? For the end of those things is death.
But now, having been set free from sin and having become servants of God, you have your fruit leading to holiness, and the outcome is eternal life.
For the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.
Or do you not know, brothers? For I am speaking to those who understand the law, that the law has authority over a person only as long as he is alive.
For the married woman is bound by the law to her living husband; but if her husband dies, she is released from the law concerning her husband.
So then, while her husband is alive, she shall be called an adulteress if she becomes united to another man; but if her husband dies, she is free from that law, so that she is not an adulteress if she marries another man.
So, my brothers, you also have died to the law through the body of Christ, so that you may belong to another, to Him who was raised from the dead, in order that we may bear fruit for God.
For when we were in the flesh, the passions of sins worked through the law in our members to bring forth fruit for death.
But now we have been released from the law, having died to that which held us captive, so that we serve in the newness of the Spirit and not in the oldness of the letter.
What then shall we say? Is the law sin? Certainly not! Yet, I would not have known sin except through the law; for I would not have known what it is to covet if the law had not said, 'You shall not covet.'
But sin, taking opportunity through the commandment, produced in me all manner of evil desire. For apart from the law, sin is dead.
I was once alive without the law; but when the commandment came, sin sprang to life.
And I died, and the commandment that was meant for life was found to lead to death for me.
For sin, taking opportunity through the commandment, deceived me and through it killed me.
So then, the law is indeed holy, and the commandment is holy, just, and good.
Did that which is good then become death to me? Certainly not! But it was sin, so that it might be shown to be sin, by bringing about my death through what is good, in order that sin might be exceedingly sinful through the commandment.
For we know that the Law is spiritual; but I am carnal, sold under sin.
For what I am doing, I do not understand; for I do not do what I want, but I do the very thing I hate.
But if I do what I do not want, I agree with the law that it is good.
So now, it is no longer I who am doing it, but the sin that dwells in me.
For I know that nothing good dwells in me, that is, in my flesh. For I have the desire to do what is good, but I cannot carry it out.
For I do not do the good I want, but the evil I do not want is what I keep doing.
Now if I do what I do not want, it is no longer I who do it, but sin dwelling in me.
So, I find this principle at work: when I want to do good, evil lies close at hand.
For I delight in the law of God in my inner being.
But I see another law at work in my members, waging war against the law of my mind and taking me captive to the law of sin that dwells in my members.
What a wretched man I am! Who will rescue me from this body that is subject to death?
Thanks be to God through Jesus Christ our Lord! So then, I myself in my mind am a servant of God’s law, but in my flesh a servant of the law of sin.
Therefore, there is now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus, who do not walk according to the flesh, but according to the Spirit.
For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has set me free from the law of sin and death.
For what the Law could not accomplish, being weak through the flesh, God sent His own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh and for sin, He condemned sin in the flesh.
So that the righteous requirement of the Law might be fulfilled in us, who do not walk according to the flesh but according to the Spirit.
For those who are according to the flesh set their minds on the things of the flesh, but those who are according to the Spirit set their minds on the things of the Spirit.
For to set the mind on the flesh is death, but to set the mind on the Spirit is life and peace; for the mind set on the flesh is hostile toward God.
For the mindset governed by the flesh is in rebellion against God; it does not submit to the law of God, nor can it do so.
So those who are in the flesh cannot please God.
But you are not in the flesh; you are in the Spirit, if indeed the Spirit of God dwells in you. If anyone does not have the Spirit of Christ, he does not belong to Him.
But if Christ is in you, although the body is dead because of sin, the Spirit is life because of righteousness.
And if the Spirit of Him who raised Jesus from the dead dwells in you, then He who raised Christ from the dead will also give life to your mortal bodies through His Spirit that dwells in you.
Therefore, brothers, we are debtors—not to the flesh, to live according to the flesh.
For if you live according to the flesh, you are destined to die; but if by the Spirit you put to death the deeds of the body, you will live.
For those who are led by the Spirit of God are the sons of God.
For you did not receive a spirit of slavery that leads back into fear, but you received the Spirit of adoption, by whom we cry out, 'Abba, Father.'
The Spirit Himself bears witness with our spirit that we are children of God.
And if we are children, then we are heirs—heirs of God and fellow heirs with Christ, provided we suffer with him in order that we may also be glorified with him.
For I consider that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory that is to be revealed to us.
For the earnest expectation of creation eagerly waits for the revealing of the sons of God.
For the creation was subjected to futility, not willingly, but because of Him who subjected it, in hope.
that the creation itself will be set free from its bondage to decay and obtain the glorious freedom of the children of God.
For we know that the whole creation has been groaning together in the pains of childbirth until now.
And not only the creation, but we ourselves, who have the firstfruits of the Spirit, also groan inwardly as we eagerly await our adoption as sons, the redemption of our bodies.
For in hope we were saved; but hope that is seen is not hope at all. For who hopes for what they already see?
But if we hope for what we do not see, we eagerly wait for it with perseverance.
In the same way, the Spirit helps us in our weaknesses; for we do not know what we ought to pray for, but the Spirit Himself intercedes for us with groanings too deep for words.
And He who searches the hearts knows what is the mind of the Spirit, because the Spirit intercedes for the saints according to God.
And we know that in all things God works together for the good of those who love Him, who have been called according to His purpose.
For those whom He foreknew, He also predestined to be conformed to the image of His Son, that He might be the firstborn among many brothers.
And those whom He predestined, He also called; and those whom He called, He also justified; and those whom He justified, He also glorified.
What then shall we say to these things? If God is for us, who can be against us?
He who did not spare His own Son, but gave Him up for us all, how will He not also with Him graciously give us all things?
Who can bring a charge against God's chosen ones? It is God who justifies.
Who is the one that condemns? It is Christ who died, and more than that, who was raised to life, who is at the right hand of God and who intercedes for us.
Who will separate us from the love of Christ? Will trouble, distress, persecution, famine, nakedness, danger, or sword?
As it is written, "For Your sake we are being killed all day long; We are regarded as sheep destined for slaughter."
Yet, in all these things, we overwhelmingly conquer through Him who loved us.
For I am convinced that neither death nor life, neither angels nor rulers, neither present things nor future things, will be able to separate us from the love of God that is in Christ Jesus our Lord.
nor height nor depth, nor any other created thing, will be able to separate us from the love of God that is in Christ Jesus our Lord.
I speak the truth in Christ—I do not lie—my conscience bears witness with me in the Holy Spirit.
I have great sorrow and unceasing anguish in my heart.
For I could wish that I myself were accursed and cut off from Christ for the sake of my brothers, my kinsmen according to the flesh.
They are Israelites; to them belong the adoption as sons, the glory, the covenants, the giving of the Law, the worship, and the promises.
Theirs are the patriarchs, and from them, according to the flesh, comes the Christ, who is over all, God blessed forever. Amen.
But it is not as though the word of God has failed. For not all who are descended from Israel belong to Israel.
Neither is it that they are all children because they are Abraham's descendants, but through Isaac shall your offspring be called.
This means that it is not the children of the flesh who are the children of God, but the children of the promise are counted as offspring.
For this is the word of promise: "At this time I will come, and Sarah shall have a son."
And not only that, but Rebekah also conceived by one man, our father Isaac.
for the children had not yet been born and had done nothing good or bad, in order that God’s purpose of election might continue, not because of works, but because of him who calls.
It was said to her, 'The elder will serve the younger.'
As it is written, 'I have loved Jacob, but I have hated Esau.'
What then shall we say? Is there injustice on God’s part? By no means!
For He says to Moses, "I will have mercy on whom I choose to have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I choose to have compassion."
Therefore, it is not by the one who wills, nor by the one who runs, but by God who shows mercy.
For the Scripture says to Pharaoh, 'I have raised you up for this very purpose, that I might display My power in you, and that My name might be proclaimed throughout all the earth.'
Therefore, He has mercy on whom He chooses to have mercy, and whom He chooses, He hardens.
You will then say to me, 'Why does He still hold us accountable? Who can oppose His will?'
But indeed, O man, who are you to reply against God? Will the thing formed say to the One who formed it, 'Why did you make me like this?'
Does not the potter have authority over the clay, to make from the same lump one vessel for honor and another for dishonor?
What if God, wanting to demonstrate His wrath and to make known His power, endured with great patience the vessels of wrath prepared for destruction?
And that He might make known the riches of His glory upon vessels of mercy, which He had prepared beforehand for glory.
whom He has called, not only from the Jews, but also from among the Gentiles.
As He says also in Hosea, 'I will call those who were not My people, 'My people,' and her who was not beloved, 'Beloved.'
And it will be in the place where it was said to them, 'You are not My people,' there they will be called 'Sons of the living God.'
Isaiah cries out concerning Israel: 'Though the number of the children of Israel be as the sand of the sea, only a remnant will be saved.'
For He will carry out His word on the earth, thoroughly and swiftly, as the Lord has decreed.
And just as Isaiah predicted, unless the Lord of Hosts had left us a seed, we would have become like Sodom, and we would have been made like Gomorrah.
What shall we say then? That the Gentiles, who were not pursuing righteousness, have obtained righteousness, even the righteousness that comes through faith.
But Israel, pursuing the law of righteousness, has not attained to the law of righteousness.
Why? Because they sought it not by faith, but as it were by the works of the law. They stumbled at that stumbling stone.
As it is written: 'Behold, I lay in Zion a stone of stumbling and a rock of offense, and whoever believes in Him will not be put to shame.'
Brothers, my heart's desire and prayer to God for the Israelites is that they may be saved.
For I bear them witness that they have a zeal for God, but not according to knowledge.
For being ignorant of the righteousness of God and seeking to establish their own, they did not submit to the righteousness of God.
For Christ is the fulfillment of the Law for righteousness to everyone who believes.
For Moses writes about the righteousness that comes from the Law, saying, 'The person who does these things will live by them.'
But the righteousness that is based on faith says this: 'Do not say in your heart, “Who will ascend into heaven?”'—that is, to bring Christ down.
Or who will descend into the abyss? That is, to bring Christ up from the dead.
But what does it say? The word is very near you, in your mouth and in your heart; that is, the message of faith which we proclaim.
That if you declare with your mouth, 'Jesus is Lord,' and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved.
For with the heart one believes, resulting in righteousness, and with the mouth confession is made, leading to salvation.
For the Scripture says, 'Everyone who puts their trust in Him will never be put to shame.'
For there is no distinction between Jew and Gentile; for the same Lord is Lord of all and richly blesses all who call on Him.
For everyone who calls upon the name of the Lord will be saved.
But how will they call on Him in whom they have not believed? And how will they believe in Him of whom they have never heard? And how will they hear without someone preaching?
And how will they preach unless they are sent? As it is written: "How beautiful are the feet of those who bring good news of peace, who proclaim good things!"
But not all have heeded the good news; for Isaiah says, 'Lord, who has believed our message?'
So faith comes from hearing, and hearing through the word of God.
But I ask, did they not hear? Indeed, their voice has gone out to all the earth, and their words to the ends of the world.
But I say, did Israel not understand? First, Moses says: 'I will make you envious by what is not a nation; by a foolish nation I will anger you.'
And Isaiah boldly declares, 'I was found by those who did not seek me; I became manifest to those who did not ask for me.'
But regarding Israel, He says: 'All day long I have stretched out My hands to a disobedient and contrary people.'
I ask then, has God rejected His people? Certainly not! For I myself am an Israelite, a descendant of Abraham, from the tribe of Benjamin.
God has not rejected His people whom He foreknew. Or do you not know what the Scripture says of Elijah, how he pleads with God against Israel?
Lord, they have killed Your prophets and torn down Your altars, and I alone am left, and they seek my life.
But what does God say to him? "I have reserved for Myself seven thousand men who have not bowed the knee to Baal."
So too, at the present time there is a remnant chosen by grace.
But if it is by grace, then it is no longer based on works; otherwise grace would no longer be grace. And if it is based on works, it is no longer grace; otherwise the work is no longer a work.
What then? Israel failed to obtain what it was seeking, but the elect obtained it, and the rest were hardened.
As it is written: 'God has given them a spirit of stupor, eyes that do not see and ears that do not hear, to this very day.'
And David says, 'Let their table become a snare, and a trap, and a stumbling block, and a recompense to them.'
Let their eyes be darkened so that they cannot see, and bend their backs continually.
I say then, have they stumbled that they should fall? Certainly not! But through their fall, salvation has come to the Gentiles, to provoke them to jealousy.
If their transgression has brought riches to the world and their failure has enriched the Gentiles, how much more will their full restoration mean?
But I am speaking to you, Gentiles. Inasmuch as I am an apostle to the Gentiles, I glorify my ministry.
If somehow I could provoke my own people to jealousy and save some of them.
For if their rejection meant the reconciliation of the world, what will their acceptance mean but life from the dead?
If the firstfruits are holy, so is the whole batch; and if the root is holy, so are the branches.
But if some of the branches were broken off, and you, being a wild olive tree, were grafted in among them and became a partaker of the root and richness of the olive tree,
Do not boast against the branches. But if you do boast, remember that you do not support the root, but the root supports you.
You will say then, 'Branches were broken off so that I might be grafted in.'
Quite right; they were broken off because of their unbelief, but you stand firm through faith. Do not be arrogant, but fear.
For if God did not spare the natural branches, He will not spare you either.
Behold therefore the kindness and severity of God: on those who fell, severity; but toward you, kindness, if you continue in His kindness; otherwise you also will be cut off.
And they also, if they do not continue in their unbelief, will be grafted in; for God is able to graft them in again.
For if you were cut out of the wild olive tree, which is by nature and were grafted contrary to nature into a cultivated olive tree, how much more shall these, who are the natural branches, be grafted into their own olive tree?
For I do not want you, brethren, to be uninformed of this mystery, so that you will not be wise in your own estimation, that a partial hardening has come upon Israel until the full number of the Gentiles comes in.
And in this way, all Israel will be saved, as it is written: "The Deliverer will come from Zion; He will turn away ungodliness from Jacob."
And this will be My covenant with them when I take away their sins.
As far as the gospel is concerned, they are enemies for your sake; but as far as election is concerned, they are beloved because of the patriarchs.
For the gifts and the calling of God are irrevocable.
For just as you once disobeyed God, now you have received mercy because of their disobedience.
So they too have now disobeyed, in order that, by your mercy, they may also receive mercy.
For God has consigned all to disobedience, that He may have mercy on all.
Oh, the depth of the riches and wisdom and knowledge of God! How unsearchable are His judgments and how inscrutable His ways!
For who has known the mind of the Lord? Or who has been His counselor?
Or who has given to God, that God should repay him?
For from Him and through Him and to Him are all things. To Him be the glory forever. Amen.
I urge you, therefore, brothers, by the mercies of God, to present your bodies as a living sacrifice, holy and pleasing to God, which is your reasonable service.
And do not conform to this world, but be transformed by the renewal of your mind, so that you may discern what is the good, acceptable, and perfect will of God.
For by the grace given to me, I say to every one of you: Do not think of yourself more highly than you ought, but rather think of yourself with sober judgment, in accordance with the measure of faith God has given you.
For just as we have many parts in one body, each of the parts does not have the same function.
So we, who are many, are one body in Christ, and individually we are members one of another.
Having gifts that differ according to the grace given to us, let us use them: if prophecy, in proportion to our faith.
If your gift is serving, then serve; if it is teaching, then teach.
If your gift is to encourage others, then encourage; if it is to give, do so with simplicity; if it is to lead, do it diligently; if it is to show mercy, do so cheerfully.
Let love be genuine. Abhor what is evil; cling to what is good.
Be devoted to one another in brotherly love; outdo one another in showing honor.
Do not be lazy in zeal, but be fervent in spirit, serving the Lord.
Rejoicing in hope, steadfast in tribulation, devoted to prayer.
Contribute to the needs of the saints and seek to show hospitality.
Bless those who persecute you; bless and do not curse.
Rejoice with those who rejoice, and weep with those who weep.
Be of the same mind toward one another. Do not set your mind on high things, but associate with the humble. Do not be wise in your own opinion.
Repay no one evil for evil, but take thought for what is noble in the sight of all.
If it is possible, so far as it depends on you, live peaceably with all.
Beloved, do not seek revenge for yourselves, but give room for the wrath of God; for it is written, 'Vengeance is Mine, I will repay,' says the Lord.
Therefore, if your enemy is hungry, feed him; if he is thirsty, give him a drink; for by doing so, you will bring burning coals upon his head.
Do not let evil conquer you, but conquer evil by doing good.
Let every person be subject to the governing authorities. For there is no authority except from God, and those that exist have been instituted by God.
Therefore, whoever resists the authority has opposed the ordinance of God, and those who have opposed will receive judgment upon themselves.
For rulers are not a terror to good conduct, but to evil. Do you wish to be unafraid of authority? Then do what is good, and you will receive praise from it.
For he is God's servant to you for good. But if you do evil, be afraid; for he does not bear the sword in vain. He is God's servant, an avenger to bring wrath on the one who practices evil.
Therefore, it is necessary to be in submission, not only because of wrath but also for the sake of conscience.
For because of this you also pay taxes, for the authorities are ministers of God, attending to this very thing.
Render therefore to all what is owed to them: taxes to whom taxes are due, customs to whom customs, fear to whom fear, honor to whom honor.
Owe no one anything, except to love one another. For he who loves another has fulfilled the law.
For the commandments, "You shall not commit adultery," "You shall not murder," "You shall not steal," and "You shall not covet," and any other commandment, are summed up in this saying: "You shall love your neighbor as yourself."
Love does no harm to a neighbor. Therefore, love is the fulfillment of the law.
And this, knowing the time, that it is already high time for us to awaken from sleep; for now our salvation is nearer than when we first believed.
The night is nearly over; the day is at hand. Therefore, let us cast off the deeds of darkness and put on the armor of light.
Let us walk honorably, as in the day, not in carousing and drunkenness, not in sexual immorality and debauchery, not in strife and envy.
But put on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make no provision for the flesh to fulfill its lusts.
Welcome the one who is weak in faith, but not to argue over differing opinions.
One person believes they can eat anything, while the one who is weak only eats vegetables.
Let not the one who eats regard with contempt the one who does not eat, and let not the one who does not eat judge the one who eats; for God has welcomed him.
Who are you to judge another’s servant? To his own master he stands or falls. And he will stand, for the Lord is able to make him stand.
One person considers one day more sacred than another; another considers every day alike. Each should be fully convinced in their own mind.
The one who observes the day, observes it in honor of the Lord; and the one who eats, eats in honor of the Lord, for they give thanks to God; while the one who abstains, abstains in honor of the Lord and gives thanks to God.
For none of us lives for ourselves, and none of us dies for ourselves.
For if we live, we live for the Lord; and if we die, we die for the Lord. Therefore, whether we live or die, we are the Lord's.
For this purpose, Christ died and rose again, and lived, so that He might be Lord of both the dead and the living.
But why do you judge your brother? Or why do you despise your brother? For we will all stand before the judgment seat of Christ.
For it is written: 'As surely as I live,' says the Lord, 'every knee will bow to me, and every tongue will confess to God.'
So then, each of us will give an account of ourselves to God.
Therefore, let us no longer judge one another, but instead make this judgment: to not place a stumbling block or obstacle in the way of a brother.
I know and am convinced in the Lord Jesus that nothing is unclean in itself; but it is unclean for anyone who thinks it unclean.
But if your brother is distressed by what you eat, you are no longer walking in love. Do not let what you eat destroy the one for whom Christ died.
Therefore, do not let your good be spoken of as evil.
For the kingdom of God is not about eating and drinking, but about righteousness, peace, and joy in the Holy Spirit.
For whoever serves Christ in these matters is pleasing to God and approved by people.
So then, let us pursue what promotes peace and builds up one another.
Do not destroy the work of God for the sake of food. Everything is indeed clean, but it is wrong for anyone to make another stumble by what he eats.
It is better not to eat meat or drink wine, or to do anything that would cause your brother to stumble, be offended, or be made weak.
Do you have faith? Keep it to yourself before God. Blessed is the one who does not condemn himself in what he approves.
But whoever has doubts is condemned if they eat, because their eating is not from faith; and whatever does not proceed from faith is sin.
We who are strong ought to bear with the failings of the weak, and not just please ourselves.
Let each of us please his neighbor for his good, to build him up.
For even Christ did not please Himself, but as it is written, "The reproaches of those who reproached You fell on Me."
For whatever was written in former times was written for our instruction, that through perseverance and the encouragement of the Scriptures, we might have hope.
May the God of patience and encouragement grant you to think the same way with one another, according to Christ Jesus.
that you may with one voice glorify the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.
Therefore, welcome one another, just as Christ welcomed you, for the glory of God.
For I tell you that Christ has become a servant to the circumcision on behalf of God’s truth, to confirm the promises made to the fathers.
And for the nations to glorify God for His mercy, as it is written: 'Therefore I will confess You among the nations, Lord, and I will sing praises to Your name.'
And again it says, 'Rejoice, O nations, with His people.'
And again, 'Praise the Lord, all you nations; let all the peoples extol Him!'
And again, Isaiah says: 'There shall be a root of Jesse, and He who arises to rule over the nations; in Him shall the nations hope.'
May the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing, so that by the power of the Holy Spirit you may abound in hope.
I am convinced, my brothers and sisters, that you yourselves are full of goodness, filled with all knowledge, and able to instruct one another.
Yet I have written to you more boldly, brothers, in part, to remind you of these things, because of the grace given to me by God.
to be a minister of Christ Jesus to the Gentiles, serving as a priest in the proclamation of the gospel of God, so that the offering of the Gentiles may be acceptable, sanctified by the Holy Spirit.
Therefore, I have reason to boast in Christ Jesus regarding my service to God.
For I will not venture to speak of anything except what Christ has accomplished through me to bring about the obedience of the Gentiles, by word and deed.
in the power of signs and wonders, in the power of the Spirit of God, so that from Jerusalem and all around as far as Illyricum, I have fully proclaimed the gospel of Christ.
Thus, I have made it my ambition to preach the gospel, not where Christ has already been named, so that I would not build on someone else’s foundation.
But as it is written: ‘Those who were not told about Him will see, and those who have not heard will understand.’
Therefore, I have often been prevented from coming to you.
But now, since I have no more opportunity in these regions, and having a strong desire to come to you for many years,
Whenever I travel to Spain, I hope to see you while passing through, and to be helped on my journey there by you, if first I may enjoy your company for a while.
But now I am going to Jerusalem, serving the saints.
For Macedonia and Achaia were pleased to make some contribution for the poor among the saints in Jerusalem.
For they were pleased to do so, and indeed they owe it to them. For if the Gentiles have shared in their spiritual blessings, they are obligated to minister to them in material things.
Therefore, when I have completed this and delivered this contribution to them, I will set out for Spain, passing through you.
But I know that when I come to you, I will come in the fullness of the blessing of Christ's Gospel.
Now I urge you, brothers, by our Lord Jesus Christ and by the love of the Spirit, to strive together with me in your prayers to God on my behalf.
that I may be delivered from those who oppose me in Judea, and that my service for Jerusalem may be acceptable to the saints.
so that I may come to you in joy by the will of God and be refreshed together with you.
And may the God of peace be with all of you. Amen.
I commend to you our sister Phoebe, a servant of the church in Cenchreae.
that you may welcome her in the Lord in a manner worthy of the saints, and help her in whatever she may need from you, for she has been a patron of many and of myself as well.
Greet Prisca and Aquila, my fellow workers in Christ Jesus,
who risked their own necks for my life. To whom not only I give thanks, but also all the churches of the Gentiles. And their church that meets in their home.
Greet my beloved Epaenetus, who is the firstfruits of Achaia to Christ.
Greet Mary, who has worked hard for us.
Greet Andronicus and Junia, my relatives and fellow prisoners, who are outstanding among the apostles, and they were in Christ before me.
Greet Ampliatus, my beloved in the Lord.
Greet Urbanus, our fellow worker in Christ, and Stachys, my beloved.
Greet Apelles, who is approved in Christ. Greet those who belong to the household of Aristobulus.
Greet Herodian, my relative. Greet those belonging to the household of Narcissus, who are in the Lord.
Greet Trophaina and Tryphosa, those who have labored hard in the Lord. Greet Persis, the beloved, who has worked very hard in the Lord.
Greet Rufus, chosen in the Lord, and his mother, who has been a mother to me as well.
Greet Asyncritus, Phlegon, Hermas, Patrobas, Hermes, and all the brothers with them.
Greet Philologus and Julia, Nereus and his sister, and Olympas, and all the saints who are with them.
Greet one another with a holy kiss. The churches of Christ greet you.
Now I urge you, brothers, to watch out for those who create divisions and cause obstacles contrary to the teaching that you have learned; avoid them.
For such people do not serve our Lord Jesus Christ, but their own appetites; and by their smooth talk and flattery, they deceive the hearts of the naive.
For your obedience has become known to all. Therefore, I rejoice over you; but I want you to be wise in what is good, and innocent in what is evil.
And the God of peace will soon crush Satan under your feet. The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you.
Timothy, my fellow worker, greets you, and so do Lucius, Jason, and Sosipater, my kinsmen.
I, Tertius, who wrote this letter, greet you in the Lord.
Gaius, my host and host of the whole church, sends you greetings. Erastus, the city treasurer, and Quartus, my brother, send their greetings to you.
The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen.



Paul, called as an apostle of Jesus Christ through the will of God, and Sosthenes our brother,
To the church of God which is in Corinth, to those who are sanctified in Christ Jesus, called to be saints, together with all who in every place call upon the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, both theirs and ours:
Grace and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
I always give thanks to my God for you, because of the grace of God that was given to you in Christ Jesus.
that you have been enriched in Him in every way, in all speech and in all knowledge.
just as the testimony about Christ was confirmed among you,
so that you do not lack any spiritual gift as you eagerly await the revelation of our Lord Jesus Christ.
He will also confirm you until the end, so that you will be blameless on the day of our Lord Jesus Christ.
God is faithful, by whom you were called into the fellowship of His Son, Jesus Christ our Lord.
Now I urge you, brothers, by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that you all speak the same thing and that there be no divisions among you, but that you be united in the same mind and in the same judgment.
For it has been reported to me concerning you, my brothers, by those of Chloe's household, that there are quarrels among you.
Now I say this, that each of you says, 'I am of Paul,' 'I am of Apollos,' 'I am of Cephas,' or 'I am of Christ.'
Is Christ divided? Was Paul crucified for you? Or were you baptized in the name of Paul?
I give thanks to God that I baptized none of you except Crispus and Gaius.
so that no one may say that they were baptized in my name.
I also baptized the household of Stephanas; beyond that, I do not recall if I baptized anyone else.
For Christ did not send me to baptize, but to proclaim the gospel, not with eloquent wisdom, so that the cross of Christ would not be emptied of its power.
For the message of the cross is foolishness to those who are perishing, but to us who are being saved, it is the power of God.
For it is written: 'I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, and the discernment of the discerning I will thwart.'
Where is the wise one? Where is the scribe? Where is the debater of this age? Has not God made foolish the wisdom of this world?
For since, in the wisdom of God, the world did not know God through its own wisdom, it pleased God to save those who believe through the foolishness of preaching.
For indeed, the Jews ask for signs, and the Greeks seek wisdom.
But we preach Christ crucified, a stumbling block to the Jews and foolishness to the Gentiles.
But to those who are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ is the power of God and the wisdom of God.
For the foolishness of God is wiser than men, and the weakness of God is stronger than men.
Consider your calling, brothers and sisters, that not many of you were wise according to worldly standards, not many were powerful, not many were of noble birth.
But God chose what is foolish in the world to shame the wise, and God chose what is weak in the world to shame the strong.
And God chose the lowly things of the world, and the despised, and the things that are not, to bring to nothing the things that are.
so that no one may boast in His presence.
But it is from Him that you are in Christ Jesus, who has become for us wisdom from God, and righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption.
So that, as it is written, 'Let the one who boasts, boast in the Lord.'
And I, when I came to you, brothers, did not come with superiority of speech or wisdom, proclaiming to you the testimony of God.
For I determined not to know anything among you except Jesus Christ, and Him crucified.
And I came to you in weakness and in fear and with much trembling.
And my message and my preaching were not in persuasive words of human wisdom, but in the demonstration of the Spirit and of power.
so that your faith would not rest on the wisdom of men, but on the power of God.
Yet, we speak wisdom among those who are mature; a wisdom not of this age nor of the rulers of this age, who are passing away.
But we speak of God’s wisdom in a hidden mystery, the wisdom that was concealed, which God predetermined before the ages for our glory.
None of the rulers of this age understood this; for if they had known, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory.
But as it is written: 'What no eye has seen, nor ear heard, nor the heart of man conceived, these are the things that God has prepared for those who love Him.'
But God has revealed them to us through His Spirit; for the Spirit searches all things, even the deep things of God.
For who among men knows the things of a man except the spirit of the man which is in him? Likewise, no one knows the things of God except the Spirit of God.
Now we have received, not the spirit of the world, but the Spirit which is from God, that we might know the things freely given to us by God.
These things we also speak, not in words taught by human wisdom, but in those taught by the Spirit, comparing spiritual things with spiritual.
But the natural person does not accept the things of the Spirit of God, for they are foolishness to him; and he is not able to understand them, because they are spiritually discerned.
But the spiritual person examines all things, yet he himself is not subject to anyone’s scrutiny.
For who has known the mind of the Lord that he may instruct Him? But we have the mind of Christ.
And I, brethren, could not speak to you as to spiritual people, but as to carnal, as to babes in Christ.
I fed you with milk and not solid food, for you were not yet able to receive it. And even now, you are still not able, for you are still worldly.
For you are still worldly, since there is jealousy and strife among you. Are you not worldly? Are you not acting like mere humans?
For when one says, ‘I belong to Paul,’ and another says, ‘I belong to Apollos,’ are you not acting like mere humans?
What then is Paul? And what is Apollos? They are simply servants through whom you came to believe, each according to the role the Lord has assigned.
I planted the seed, Apollos watered it, but God is the one who caused it to grow.
So neither the one who plants nor the one who waters is anything, but only God, who causes the growth.
Now he who plants and he who waters are one; but each will receive his own reward according to his own labor.
For we are co-workers in God’s service; you are God’s field, God’s building.
According to the grace of God given to me, as a wise master builder, I have laid a foundation, and another builds upon it. Let each one take heed how he builds on it.
For no one can lay a foundation other than that which is laid, which is Jesus Christ.
Now if anyone builds upon this foundation with gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, or straw,
The quality of each person's work will become evident, for the day will reveal it; it will be tested by fire, and the fire will demonstrate what kind of work it is.
If anyone's work remains that he has built upon the foundation, he will receive a reward.
If anyone's work is burned up, he will suffer loss, but he himself will be saved, yet so as through fire.
Do you not realize that you are a temple of God and that the Spirit of God dwells in you?
If anyone destroys the temple of God, God will destroy that person; for the temple of God is holy, and you are that temple.
Let no one deceive himself. If anyone among you thinks he is wise in this age, let him become a fool, that he may become wise.
For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God. For it is written: 'He catches the wise in their own craftiness.'
And again, the Lord knows the thoughts of the wise, that they are futile.
So let no one boast in men, for all things are yours.
whether Paul or Apollos or Cephas or the world or life or death or present things or future things, all are yours.
But you belong to Christ, and Christ belongs to God.
Let a person regard us in this way: as servants of Christ and stewards of the mysteries of God.
Moreover, it is required of stewards that one be found faithful.
As for me, it matters very little that I am judged by you or by any human court; indeed, I do not even judge myself.
For I am not aware of anything against myself; yet I am not thereby acquitted. It is the Lord who examines me.
Therefore do not judge anything before the appointed time, until the Lord comes, who will bring to light the hidden things of darkness and disclose the motives of the hearts. Then each will receive praise from God.
Now, brothers, I have applied these things to myself and Apollos for your benefit, so that in us you may learn not to go beyond what is written, and that none of you may be puffed up in favor of one against another.
For who regards you as superior? And what do you have that you did not receive? If you did indeed receive it, why do you boast as though you had not received it?
Already you are filled! Already you have become rich! You have begun to reign without us—indeed, I wish you did reign, so that we might share in that reign with you!
For I think that God has displayed us, the apostles, last of all, like those sentenced to death; for we have become a spectacle to the world, both to angels and to men.
We are regarded as fools for Christ's sake, but you are considered wise in Christ; we are weak, but you are strong; you are esteemed, but we are dishonored.
To this very hour we hunger and thirst; we are poorly clothed, beaten, and homeless.
And we labor, working with our own hands. When we are insulted, we bless; when we are persecuted, we endure.
When we are slandered, we plead for understanding; we have become like the scum of the earth, the refuse of all things, even until now.
I do not write these things to shame you, but as my beloved children, I admonish you.
For though you may have countless teachers in Christ, you do not have many fathers; for in Christ Jesus, through the gospel, I became your father.
Therefore, I urge you, be imitators of me.
For this reason, I have sent you Timothy, who is my beloved and faithful child in the Lord. He will remind you of my ways in Christ, just as I teach everywhere in every church.
Now some of you have become arrogant as though I were not coming to you.
But I will come to you quickly, if the Lord wills, and I will know not the words of the arrogant, but the power behind them.
For the kingdom of God does not consist in words, but in power.
What do you prefer? Shall I come to you with a rod, or in love and with a spirit of gentleness?
It is widely reported among you that there is immorality, and such immorality as is not even named among the Gentiles, that a man has his father's wife.
And you are arrogant! Should you not rather have mourned, so that the one who has committed this deed might be removed from among you?
For I, although absent in body but present in spirit, have already judged the one who has done this thing as though I were present.
In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, when you are gathered together with my spirit, along with the power of our Lord Jesus Christ,
Hand this man over to Satan for the destruction of the flesh, so that his spirit may be saved on the day of the Lord Jesus.
Your boasting is not good. Do you not know that a little leaven leavens the whole lump?
Clean out the old leaven, that you may be a new batch, just as you are unleavened. For Christ, our Passover, has been sacrificed for us.
Therefore, let us celebrate the feast, not with the old leaven, the leaven of malice and wickedness, but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth.
I have written to you in my letter not to associate with those who engage in sexual immorality.
But I did not mean that you should completely avoid contact with those who engage in sexual immorality, or with greedy persons, or with swindlers, or with idolaters; otherwise, you would have to leave this world.
But now I have written to you not to associate with anyone who claims to be a brother, yet engages in sexual immorality, greed, idolatry, slander, drunkenness, or swindling. With such a person, do not even eat.
For what have I to do with judging those outside the church? Is it not those inside the church whom you are to judge?
But God will judge those outside. Remove the wicked person from among yourselves.
Does any of you, when he has a matter against another, dare to go to law before the unjust instead of before the saints?
Do you not know that the saints will judge the world? And if the world is judged by you, are you unworthy to judge the smallest matters?
Do you not know that we will judge angels? How much more, then, matters of this life?
If you have judgments concerning matters of this life, why do you appoint those who are regarded as of no account in the church to decide?
I say this to your shame. Is there not a wise person among you, not even one who is able to mediate between his brothers?
But instead, brother goes to law against brother, and that before unbelievers.
Indeed, it is already a defeat for you that you have lawsuits against one another. Why not rather suffer wrong? Why not rather be defrauded?
But you wrong one another and defraud, even your own brothers?
Or do you not know that the unrighteous will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived: neither the sexually immoral, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor men who practice homosexuality,
nor greedy, nor thieves, nor drunkards, nor slanderers, nor swindlers will inherit the kingdom of God.
And such were some of you. But you were washed, you were sanctified, you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and by the Spirit of our God.
"All things are lawful for me," but not everything is beneficial; "all things are lawful for me," but I will not be dominated by anything.
Food is meant for the stomach, and the stomach for food; but God will bring both to an end. The body is not meant for sexual immorality, but for the Lord, and the Lord for the body.
And God raised the Lord, and He will also raise us up by His power.
Do you not know that your bodies are members of Christ? Shall I then take the members of Christ and make them members of a prostitute? Certainly not!
Or do you not know that he who is joined to a prostitute becomes one body with her? For it is said, 'The two shall become one flesh.'
But he who is joined to the Lord is one spirit with Him.
Flee from sexual immorality. Every other sin a person commits is outside the body, but the one who engages in sexual immorality sins against his own body.
Or do you not realize that your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit within you, whom you have from God? You are not your own.
For you were bought with a price. Therefore, glorify God in your body and in your spirit, which are God's.
Now concerning the matters you wrote about, it is good for a man not to engage intimately with a woman.
But because of sexual immorality, each man should have his own wife, and each woman her own husband.
The husband should fulfill his marital duty to his wife, and likewise the wife to her husband.
The wife does not have authority over her own body, but the husband does; and likewise, the husband does not have authority over his own body, but the wife does.
Do not deprive one another, except with consent for a limited time, so that you may devote yourselves to prayer; and come together again, so that Satan does not tempt you because of your lack of self-control.
But I say this as a concession, not as a command.
For I wish that all people were as I am; but each has his own gift from God, one in this way and another in that.
To the unmarried and the widows, I say: it is good for them to remain as I am.
But if they cannot exercise self-control, let them marry; for it is better to marry than to be consumed with passion.
To the married, I command—yet not I, but the Lord—that a wife should not separate from her husband.
But if she does separate, let her remain unmarried, or be reconciled to her husband; and let not a husband divorce his wife.
To the rest I say, not the Lord: If any brother has an unbelieving wife and she is willing to live with him, he should not divorce her.
And if a woman has a husband who is an unbeliever, and he is willing to live with her, she should not divorce him.
For the unbelieving husband is made holy through his wife, and the unbelieving wife is made holy through her husband. Otherwise, your children would be unclean, but now they are holy.
But if the unbeliever departs, let them depart. A brother or a sister is not bound in such cases. For God has called us to peace.
For how do you know, O wife, whether you will save your husband? Or how do you know, O husband, whether you will save your wife?
Nevertheless, let each one walk according to the gift God has given him, and as the Lord has called him. Thus I instruct in all the churches.
Was anyone called while circumcised? Let him not become uncircumcised. Was anyone called while uncircumcised? Let him not be circumcised.
For circumcision is nothing, and uncircumcision is nothing, but keeping the commandments of God is what matters.
Let each person remain in the state in which he was called.
Were you called while a slave? Do not let that trouble you; but if you can become free, take the opportunity.
For the one who was called in the Lord while a slave is the Lord's freedman; likewise, he who was called while free is Christ's slave.
You were bought with a price; do not become servants of men.
So, brothers and sisters, let each one remain with God in the condition in which he was called.
Now concerning the unmarried women, I have no command from the Lord, but I give my opinion as one who has been shown mercy by the Lord to be faithful.
Therefore, I consider it best for a person to remain as they are because of the present distress, as it is good for a person to be in such a condition.
Are you bound to a wife? Do not seek to be free. Are you free from a wife? Do not seek a wife.
But if you do marry, you have not sinned; and if a virgin marries, she has not sinned. However, those who marry will face challenges in this life, and I want to spare you that.
This is what I mean, brothers: the time is limited. So, from now on, those who have wives should live as if they do not.
And those who weep, as though they were not weeping, and those who rejoice, as though they were not rejoicing, and those who buy, as though they possessed nothing.
And those who are engaged with the affairs of this world should act as though they were not engaged, for the form of this world is passing away.
But I want you to be free from anxiety. The unmarried man cares for the things of the Lord, how he may please the Lord.
But he who is married is anxious about the things of the world, how he may please his wife.
There is a distinction between a woman and a virgin. The unmarried woman cares about the things of the Lord, that she may be holy in both body and spirit; but she who is married cares about the things of the world, how she may please her husband.
And I say this for your own benefit, not to put a restraint upon you, but for the sake of promoting good order and securing undistracted devotion to the Lord.
But if anyone thinks he is behaving improperly toward his virgin, if she is past the prime of life, and if it must be so, let him do what he wishes. He does not sin; let them marry.
But if someone stands firm in their heart, having no necessity but has control over their own will, and has decided this in their heart to keep his own virgin, he does well.
So then, he who marries does well, but he who does not marry does even better.
A wife is bound by law as long as her husband lives; but if her husband dies, she is free to marry whom she wishes, only in the Lord.
But she will be happier if she remains as she is, in my opinion; and I think that I also have the Spirit of God.
Now concerning food offered to idols, we know that we all possess knowledge. However, knowledge puffs up, but love builds up.
If anyone thinks he knows something, he has not yet come to know as he ought to know.
But if anyone loves God, he is known by Him.
Therefore, concerning the eating of food offered to idols, we know that an idol is nothing in the world, and that there is no other God but one.
For even if there are so-called gods, whether in heaven or on earth—as indeed there are many so-called gods and many lords,
Yet for us there is one God, the Father, from whom are all things and for whom we exist, and one Lord, Jesus Christ, through whom are all things and through whom we exist.
However, not everyone possesses this knowledge. Some, through their conscience being weak, still eat food offered to idols as if it were something sacrificial, and their conscience is defiled.
But food does not commend us to God. We are no better if we eat, and no worse if we do not eat.
But beware that this liberty of yours does not become a stumbling block to those who are weak.
For if someone sees you, who have knowledge, reclining at a table in an idol’s temple, will not his conscience, being weak, be emboldened to eat the things offered to idols?
And so, by your knowledge, the brother who is weak perishes, for whom Christ died.
Thus, by sinning against the brothers and wounding their weak conscience, you are sinning against Christ.
Therefore, if food causes my brother to stumble, I will never eat meat again, so that I may not cause my brother to stumble.
Am I not an apostle? Am I not free? Have I not seen Jesus Christ our Lord? Are not you my work in the Lord?
If I am not an apostle to others, surely I am to you; for you are the seal of my apostleship in the Lord.
This is my defense to those who examine me.
Do we not have the right to eat and drink?
Do we not have the right to lead about a believing wife, as do the other apostles and the brothers of the Lord and Cephas?
Or do only I and Barnabas not have the right to refrain from working?
Who serves as a soldier at his own expense? Who plants a vineyard and does not eat of its fruit? Or who shepherds a flock and does not drink from the milk of the flock?
Am I speaking these things merely from a human perspective? Or does not the Law also say the same?
For it is written in the law of Moses: 'You shall not muzzle an ox while it is treading out the grain.' Is God concerned only for oxen?
Or does he speak entirely for our sake? It was for our sake that this was written, that he who plows should plow in hope, and he who threshes in hope should be partaker of that hope.
If we have sown spiritual things among you, is it too much if we reap material things from you?
If others share in this right of ours, should we not have even more? Yet we have not made use of this right. Instead, we endure all things so that we may not hinder the gospel of Christ.
Do you not know that those who serve in the temple eat the food from the temple, and those who attend to the altar share in the offerings of the altar?
In the same way, the Lord has commanded that those who proclaim the gospel should earn their living by the gospel.
But I have not used any of these rights. And I am not writing this to secure any such provision; for I would rather die than have anyone deprive me of my reason to boast.
For if I preach the gospel, I have no reason to boast; for necessity is laid upon me. Woe to me if I do not preach the gospel!
For if I do this willingly, I have a reward; but if against my will, I am entrusted with a stewardship.
What then is my reward? That when I preach the gospel, I may present it without charge, so as not to misuse my authority in the gospel of Christ.
For though I am free from all men, I have made myself a servant to all, that I might win more of them.
And to the Jews I became as a Jew, so that I might win the Jews; to those under the Law, I became as one under the Law, so that I might win those under the Law.
To those outside the law, I became as one outside the law—though I am not without the law of God, but under the law of Christ—so that I might win those outside the law.
To the weak, I became weak, that I might win the weak; I have become all things to all people, so that by all means I might save some.
I do all this for the sake of the gospel, that I may become a partaker of it with others.
Do you not know that those who run in a race all run, but one receives the prize? Run in such a way that you may obtain it.
Every athlete exercises self-control in all things. They do it to receive a perishable crown, but we an imperishable one.
Therefore, I run in such a way as not without a goal; I box in such a manner as not beating the air.
But I discipline my body and bring it into subjection, lest after preaching to others, I myself should become disqualified.
For I do not want you to be unaware, brothers, that our forefathers were all under the cloud, and all passed through the sea.
and all were baptized into Moses in the cloud and in the sea.
And all ate the same spiritual food.
And all drank the same spiritual drink, for they drank from the spiritual rock that followed them, and that rock was Christ.
Yet God was not pleased with most of them; their bodies were scattered in the wilderness.
Now these things took place as examples for us, so that we might not desire evil as they did.
Do not become idolaters, as some of them were; as it is written, 'The people sat down to eat and drink, and rose up to revel.'
Let us not engage in sexual immorality, as some of them did, and twenty-three thousand fell in a single day.
Nor should we test Christ, as some of them did and were destroyed by serpents.
Nor should you complain, as some of them did and were destroyed by the destroyer.
These things happened to them as examples, and were written down as warnings for us, upon whom the end of the ages has come.
Therefore, let anyone who thinks he stands take heed lest he fall.
No temptation has overtaken you that is not common to man. God is faithful, and he will not let you be tempted beyond your ability, but with the temptation he will also provide the way of escape, that you may be able to endure it.
Therefore, my beloved, flee from idolatry.
I speak to you as wise people; judge for yourselves what I say.
Is not the cup of blessing that we bless a participation in the blood of Christ? Is not the bread that we break a participation in the body of Christ?
Because there is one bread, we who are many are one body, for we all partake of the one bread.
Consider Israel according to the flesh: Are not those who eat the sacrifices partakers of the altar?
What am I saying then? That an idol is anything? Or that what is offered to idols is anything?
Rather, what I am saying is that the sacrifices of the nations are offered to demons and not to God; and I do not want you to become participants with demons.
You cannot drink the cup of the Lord and the cup of demons; you cannot partake of the table of the Lord and the table of demons.
Or do we provoke the Lord to jealousy? Are we stronger than He?
"All things are permissible for me, but not all things are beneficial; all things are permissible for me, but not all things edify."
Let no one seek his own good, but the good of his neighbor.
Eat whatever is sold in the meat market, without raising any question on the ground of conscience.
For the earth is the Lord's, and everything in it.
If an unbeliever invites you to a meal and you choose to go, eat whatever is set before you, asking no questions for the sake of conscience.
But if someone tells you, ‘This has been offered in sacrifice to an idol,’ do not eat it, for the sake of the one who informed you, and for the sake of conscience. For the earth is the Lord's, and everything in it.
I mean not your own conscience, but the conscience of the other. For why should my freedom be judged by someone else's conscience?
If I partake with gratitude, why am I slandered for that for which I give thanks?
So, whether you eat or drink, or whatever you do, do all to the glory of God.
Be sensitive to all—both Jews and Greeks, and to the Church of God.
Just as I try to please everyone in all things, not seeking my own advantage, but that of many, so that they may be saved.
Be imitators of me, as I am of Christ.
I commend you, brothers, that you remember me in everything and maintain the teachings just as I delivered them to you.
But I want you to understand that the head of every man is Christ, the head of the woman is her husband, and the head of Christ is God.
Every man who prays or prophesies with his head covered brings shame upon his head.
But every woman who prays or prophesies with her head uncovered dishonors her head; for it is one and the same as if her head were shaved.
For if a woman does not cover her head, let her also be shorn; but if it is shameful for a woman to be shorn or shaved, let her cover her head.
For a man ought not to cover his head, being the image and glory of God; but woman is the glory of man.
For man does not come from woman, but woman comes from man.
And indeed, man was not created for the sake of the woman, but woman for the sake of man.
For this reason, a woman should have a symbol of authority on her head because of the angels.
However, in the Lord, neither is man independent of woman, nor woman independent of man.
For just as woman came from man, so also man is born through woman; but all things come from God.
Judge for yourselves: is it proper for a woman to pray to God with her head uncovered?
Does not nature itself teach you that if a man has long hair, it is a disgrace to him?
But if a woman has long hair, it is her glory? For her hair is given to her as a covering.
But if anyone is inclined to be contentious, we have no such custom, nor do the churches of God.
Now in giving this instruction, I do not praise you, since your gatherings are not resulting in a better condition, but in a worse one.
For first of all, when you come together as a church, I hear that there are divisions among you, and I partly believe it.
For there must be factions among you, so that those who are genuine may be recognized among you.
When you come together, it is not possible to eat the Lord's Supper.
For in eating, each one goes ahead with his own meal, and one goes hungry while another gets drunk.
What? Do you not have houses to eat and drink in? Or do you despise the church of God and shame those who have nothing? What shall I say to you? Shall I commend you in this? I do not commend you!
For I received from the Lord what I also delivered to you, that the Lord Jesus, on the night he was betrayed, took bread; and when he had given thanks, he broke it and said,
"Take, eat; this is my body, which is broken for you. Do this in remembrance of me."
In the same manner, He took the cup after supper, saying, 'This cup is the new covenant in My blood; do this as often as you drink it, in remembrance of Me.'
For as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup, you proclaim the Lord's death until He comes.
Therefore, whoever eats this bread or drinks this cup of the Lord in an unworthy manner will be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord.
But let a person examine himself, and so let him eat of the bread and drink of the cup.
For anyone who eats and drinks without recognizing the body of the Lord eats and drinks judgment upon themselves.
That is why many among you are weak and ill, and some have fallen asleep.
For if we were to properly judge ourselves, we would not be judged.
But when we are judged by the Lord, we are being disciplined so that we may not be condemned along with the world.
Therefore, my brothers, when you come together to eat, wait for one another.
But if anyone is hungry, let him eat at home, so that when you come together, it will not be for judgment. As for the other matters, I will set them in order when I come.
Now concerning spiritual gifts, brothers, I do not want you to be uninformed.
You know that when you were Gentiles, you were carried away to mute idols, however you were led.
Therefore, I want you to understand that no one speaking by the Spirit of God says, 'Jesus be cursed,' and no one can say, 'Jesus is Lord,' except by the Holy Spirit.
Now there are varieties of gifts, but the same Spirit.
And there are varieties of services, but it is the same Lord who is served.
And there are different workings, but it is the same God who is at work in all things.
To each one is given the manifestation of the Spirit for the benefit of all.
For to one is given through the Spirit the word of wisdom, and to another the word of knowledge according to the same Spirit.
To another, faith by the same Spirit; to another, gifts of healing by the one Spirit.
to another, workings of miracles; to another, prophecy; to another, discerning of spirits; to another, various kinds of tongues; to another, the interpretation of tongues.
But all these things are empowered by one and the same Spirit, who distributes to each one individually as He wills.
For just as the body is one and has many members, and all the members of that one body, being many, are one body, so also is Christ.
For by one Spirit we were all baptized into one body, whether Jews or Greeks, whether slaves or free, and we were all made to drink of one Spirit.
For the body is not one member, but many.
If the foot should say, 'Because I am not a hand, I am not a part of the body,' would it therefore cease to be part of the body?
And if the ear says, 'Because I am not an eye, I am not part of the body,' is it therefore not part of the body?
If the whole body were an eye, where would the hearing be? If the whole were hearing, where would the sense of smell be?
But now God has arranged each one of the members in the body just as He desired.
But if all were one member, where would the body be?
But now, there are many members, yet one body.
The eye cannot say to the hand, ‘I have no need of you’; nor again the head to the feet, ‘I have no need of you.’
But much more, those members of the body that seem to be weaker are indispensable.
And those parts of the body that we consider less honorable, we bestow greater honor upon; and our unpresentable parts are treated with even greater modesty.
But our more presentable parts have no need for special treatment. Yet God has composed the body, giving greater honor to the parts that lacked it.
so that there may be no division in the body, but that its members may have the same care for one another.
And if one member suffers, all the members suffer together; if one member is honored, all the members rejoice together.
Now you are the body of Christ, and each one of you is a part of it.
And God has appointed in the church first apostles, second prophets, third teachers, then miracles, followed by gifts of healing, assistance, leadership, and various kinds of tongues.
Are all apostles? Are all prophets? Are all teachers? Do all work miracles?
Do all have gifts of healing? Do all speak in tongues? Do all interpret?
But earnestly desire the greater gifts. And yet, I will show you a way that surpasses all.
If I speak in the tongues of men and of angels, but do not have love, I am nothing more than a resounding gong or a clanging cymbal.
And if I possess the gift of prophecy and understand all mysteries and all knowledge; and if I have all faith so as to remove mountains, but do not have love, I am nothing.
And if I were to give away all my possessions, and if I were to surrender my body to be burned, but do not have love, I gain nothing.
Love is patient; love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud.
It does not behave inappropriately, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily provoked, it does not take account of wrongs.
It does not rejoice in unrighteousness, but rejoices with the truth.
Love always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres.
Love never fails. But where there are prophecies, they will cease; where there are tongues, they will be stilled; where there is knowledge, it will pass away.
For we know in part and we prophesy in part;
But when the perfect comes, that which is partial will be done away with.
When I was a child, I spoke like a child, I thought like a child, I reasoned like a child; but when I became a man, I put away childish things.
For now we see in a mirror dimly, but then we shall see face to face. Now I know in part, but then I shall know fully, even as I have been fully known.
And now these three remain: faith, hope, and love. But the greatest of these is love.
Pursue love earnestly, and strive for spiritual gifts, especially that you may prophesy.
For he who speaks in a tongue does not speak to men, but to God; indeed, no one understands him; he utters mysteries in the Spirit.
But the one who prophesies speaks to men for their edification, encouragement, and consolation.
The one who speaks in a tongue edifies himself, but the one who prophesies builds up the church.
I desire that all of you would speak in tongues, but even more, that you would prophesy; for the one who prophesies is greater than the one who speaks in tongues, unless he interprets, so that the church may receive edification.
Now, brothers, if I come to you speaking in tongues, how will I benefit you unless I speak to you either by revelation, knowledge, prophecy, or teaching?
Yet even lifeless instruments, whether flute or harp, if they do not produce distinct notes, how will anyone recognize what is played?
And if the trumpet produces an unclear sound, who will prepare for battle?
So likewise you, unless you speak with a clear and meaningful word, how will what is spoken be recognized? For you will be speaking into the air.
There are, undoubtedly, many different languages in the world, and none of them is without meaning.
Therefore, if I do not grasp the meaning of the voice, I will be a foreigner to the one speaking, and the one speaking will be a foreigner to me.
So it is with you; since you are zealous for spiritual gifts, seek to excel in building up the church.
Therefore, let the one who speaks in a tongue pray that he may interpret.
For if I pray in a tongue, my spirit prays, but my mind is unfruitful.
What is the conclusion then? I will pray with my spirit, but I will also pray with my understanding; I will sing with my spirit, but I will also sing with my understanding.
For if you bless with the spirit, how will he who occupies the place of the uninformed say 'Amen' at your giving of thanks, since he does not understand what you say?
For you are giving thanks well enough, but the other person is not being built up.
I thank my God that I speak in tongues more than all of you.
But in the church, I would rather speak five intelligible words to instruct others than ten thousand words in a tongue.
Brothers, do not be children in your thinking; rather, in malice be infants, but in your thinking be mature.
In the Law it is written: 'With other tongues and through the lips of strangers I will speak to this people, and even then they will not listen to me,' says the Lord.
So tongues are a sign not for believers but for unbelievers; while prophecy is not for unbelievers, but for believers.
If therefore the whole church assembles together and all speak in tongues, and uninformed people or unbelievers come in, will they not say that you are out of your minds?
But if all prophesy, and an unbeliever or an uninformed person enters, he is convicted by all, he is called to account by all.
And thus, the hidden secrets of his heart are made manifest; and so falling down on his face, he will worship God, declaring that God is truly among you.
What then shall we say, brothers? Whenever you come together, each of you has a psalm, a teaching, a tongue, a revelation, or an interpretation. Let all things be done for the edification.
If anyone speaks in a tongue, let there be two or at most three, each in turn, and let someone interpret.
But if there is no interpreter, let him keep silent in the church and speak to himself and to God.
Let two or three prophets speak, and let the others discern.
But if something is revealed to another who is sitting down, let the first keep silent.
For you can all prophesy one by one, so that all may learn and all may be encouraged.
And the spirits of the prophets are subject to the prophets.
For God is not a God of confusion, but of peace.
As in all the churches of the saints, let your women keep silent in the churches; for it is not permitted for them to speak, but they are to be in submission, as also the law says.
And if they wish to learn anything, let them ask their own husbands at home; for it is shameful for women to speak in the church.
Or did the word of God originate with you? Or are you the only ones it has reached?
If anyone thinks he is a prophet or spiritual, let him acknowledge that the things I write to you are the commandments of the Lord.
But if anyone chooses to be ignorant, let him remain in ignorance.
Therefore, brothers, earnestly desire to prophesy, and do not forbid speaking in tongues.
Let all things be done in a fitting manner and in order.
Now, brothers, I remind you of the gospel that I preached to you, which you also received and in which you stand.
By this gospel you are saved, if you hold firmly to the word I preached to you; otherwise, you have believed in vain.
For I delivered to you, first of all, that which I also received: that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures.
and that He was buried, and that He rose again the third day according to the Scriptures,
and that He was seen by Cephas, then by the twelve.
After that, He appeared to more than five hundred of the brothers at once, most of whom are still alive, though some have fallen asleep.
Then He was seen by James, and later by all the apostles.
And last of all, as if I were born out of due time, He appeared to me.
For I am the least of the apostles, unworthy to be called an apostle, because I persecuted the church of God.
But by the grace of God, I am what I am; and His grace toward me was not in vain. On the contrary, I worked harder than any of them, yet not I, but the grace of God that was with me.
Whether then it is I or they, so we preach, and so you believed.
Now, if Christ is proclaimed as raised from the dead, how can some of you say that there is no resurrection of the dead?
But if there is no resurrection of the dead, then Christ has not been raised.
And if Christ has not been raised, then our preaching is empty, and your faith is also empty.
We are even found to be false witnesses of God, because we testified about God that He raised Christ, whom He did not raise if the dead are not raised.
For if the dead do not rise, then Christ has not been raised.
And if Christ has not been raised, your faith is futile; you are still in your sins.
Then those who have fallen asleep in Christ have perished.
If in this life only we have hoped in Christ, we are of all people most miserable.
But now Christ has been raised from the dead, the firstfruits of those who have died.
For since death came through a man, the resurrection of the dead also comes through a man.
For as in Adam all die, so also in Christ shall all be made alive.
But each in his own order: Christ the firstfruits, and afterward, those who belong to Christ at His coming.
Then comes the end, when He delivers the kingdom to God the Father, after He has abolished all rule and all authority and power.
For He must reign until He has put all His enemies under His feet.
The last enemy to be abolished is death.
For He has put everything in subjection under His feet. But when it says that everything has been subjected, it is clear that this does not include the One who subjected everything to Him.
And when all things are subjected to Him, then the Son Himself will also be subjected to the One who put all things in subjection under Him, so that God may be all in all.
Otherwise, what will those do who are baptized for the dead? If the dead do not rise at all, why then are they baptized for the dead?
What are we doing, facing danger at every hour?
I face death every day, and I do so by the boast I have in you, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.
If I fought wild beasts in Ephesus merely from a human perspective, what did I gain? If the dead are not raised, "Let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we die."
Do not be deceived; bad company corrupts good character.
Awaken to righteousness and do not sin; for some have no knowledge of God. I speak this to your shame.
But someone will ask, 'How are the dead raised? With what kind of body do they come?'
You fool! What you sow does not come to life unless it dies.
And what you sow is not the body that is to be, but a bare seed, perhaps of wheat or of some other grain.
But God gives it a body as He has chosen, and to each seed its own body.
Not all flesh is the same; there is one kind for humans, another kind for animals, another for fish, and another for birds.
And there are celestial bodies, and there are terrestrial bodies; but the glory of the celestial is one kind, and the glory of the terrestrial is another.
There is one kind of glory of the sun, and another kind of glory of the moon, and another kind of glory of the stars; for star differs from star in glory.
So it is with the resurrection of the dead. It is sown in corruption, it is raised in incorruption;
It is sown in dishonor; it is raised in glory. It is sown in weakness; it is raised in power.
It is sown a natural body; it is raised a spiritual body. There is a natural body, and there is a spiritual body.
Thus it is written, 'The first man Adam became a living being'; the last Adam became a life-giving spirit.
But it is not the spiritual that comes first, but the natural; and afterward the spiritual.
The first man was made from the dust of the earth; the second man is the Lord from heaven.
As was the earthly man, so are those who are of the earth; and as is the heavenly man, so also are those who are of heaven.
And just as we have borne the likeness of the earthly man, so shall we bear the likeness of the heavenly man.
I declare to you, brothers and sisters, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God, nor does the perishable inherit the imperishable.
Behold, I tell you a mystery: We will not all sleep, but we will all be changed.
In an instant, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trumpet; for the trumpet will sound, and the dead will be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed.
For this perishable body must be clothed with imperishability, and this mortal body must be clothed with immortality.
But when this perishable body is clothed with imperishability, and this mortal body is clothed with immortality, then the saying that is written will come to pass: 'Death has been swallowed up in victory.'
Where, O death, is your sting? Where, O Hades, is your victory?
The sting of death is sin, and the power of sin is the Law.
But thanks be to God, who gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.
Therefore, my beloved brothers, be steadfast, immovable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, knowing that your labor is not in vain in the Lord.
Now concerning the collection for the saints, as I directed the churches of Galatia, so you also are to do.
On the first day of every week, each of you should set aside a sum of money in keeping with your income, so that when I come no collections will have to be made.
When I arrive, I will send those whom you approve with letters to carry your gift to Jerusalem.
But if it is worthy for me to go as well, they will journey with me.
But I will come to you after I have passed through Macedonia, for I am passing through Macedonia.
But perhaps I will stay with you, or even spend the winter, so that you may help me on my journey, wherever I go.
For I do not wish to see you now just in passing, but I hope to spend some time with you, if the Lord permits.
But I will remain in Ephesus until Pentecost.
For a wide door for effective work has opened to me, and there are many adversaries.
But if Timothy comes, see that he is with you without fear, for he is doing the work of the Lord, just as I am. Therefore, let no one despise him.
Therefore, send him on his way in peace, so that he may come to me; for I expect him to arrive with the brothers.
Now concerning our brother Apollos, I greatly encouraged him to visit you with the brothers; however, it was not at all his desire to come now, but he will come when he has the opportunity.
Be watchful, stand firm in the faith, be courageous, be strong.
Let all that you do be done in love.
Now, brothers and sisters, I urge you to pay attention to the household of Stephanas, for they were the first converts in Achaia and have devoted themselves to the service of the saints.
so that you may also submit to such people and to everyone who works hard and labors among you.
I rejoice in the presence of Stephanas, Fortunatus, and Achaicus, because they have supplied what was lacking from you.
For they have refreshed my spirit and yours. Therefore, recognize such people.
The churches of Asia send their greetings to you. Aquila and Priscilla, along with the church that meets in their home, send their heartfelt greetings in the Lord.
All the brothers send you greetings. Greet one another with a holy kiss.
This greeting is written with my own hand, Paul.
If anyone does not love the Lord Jesus Christ, let him be accursed. Come, O Lord!
The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with you.
My love be with all of you in Christ Jesus. Amen.
Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God, and Timothy our brother, to the church of God that is at Corinth, with all the saints who are in the whole region of Achaia.
Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of mercies and the God of all comfort.
who comforts us in all our affliction, so that we may be able to comfort those who are in any affliction, with the comfort with which we ourselves are comforted by God.
For as the sufferings of Christ abound in us, so also our comfort abounds through Christ.
But whether we are afflicted, it is for your encouragement and salvation, which is accomplished through the endurance of the same sufferings that we also endure; and our hope for you is steadfast, knowing that as you share in our sufferings, so you will also share in our comfort.
Our hope for you is unshakeable, for we know that just as you share in our sufferings, so also you share in our comfort.
For we do not want you to be uninformed, brothers, about the affliction we experienced in Asia, for we were so utterly burdened beyond our ability to endure, that we despaired of life itself.
But we had the sentence of death within ourselves, so that we would not trust in ourselves but in God who raises the dead.
He who delivered us from such a deadly peril will continue to deliver us; in him we have set our hope that he will again rescue us.
You also must join in helping us by your prayers, so that many will give thanks on our behalf for the gracious gift granted to us through the prayers of many.
For our boast is this, the testimony of our conscience, that we conducted ourselves in the world with simplicity and godly sincerity, not by earthly wisdom but by the grace of God, and especially toward you.
For we are not writing to you anything other than what you are reading and acknowledging; and I hope that you will fully understand it until the end.
just as you have partially known us, that we are your boast, just as you also are ours, in the day of our Lord Jesus.
And with this confidence, I intended to visit you first, so that you might experience a second blessing.
and to pass through Macedonia on your behalf, and then to return to you from Macedonia and be sent on my way to Judea by you.
So, when I planned this, did I make my plans lightly? Or the things I purpose, do I purpose according to the flesh, so that there may be 'Yes, yes' and 'No, no' in my statements?
But as surely as God is faithful, our word to you has not been 'Yes' and 'No.'
For the Son of God, Jesus Christ, who was proclaimed among you through us, by me and Silas and Timothy, did not become 'Yes' and 'No,' but in Him it has always been 'Yes.'
For all the promises of God find their fulfillment in Him; therefore, through Him we say 'Yes' to the glory of God.
Now it is God who establishes us along with you in Christ and has anointed us.
who also sealed us and gave us the Spirit as a pledge in our hearts.
But I call God as my witness, upon my soul, that out of consideration for you, I did not come again to Corinth.
Not that we lord it over your faith, but we are workers alongside you for your joy; for it is by your faith that you stand firm.
So I decided within myself that I would not come to you again in sorrow.
For if I cause you sorrow, who then can bring me joy, except the one whom I have made sorrowful?
And I wrote to you this very thing, so that when I came I would not be saddened by those who ought to make me rejoice, for I am confident that my joy is the joy of all of you.
For out of much affliction and distress of heart I wrote to you with many tears, not to grieve you, but so that you might know the abundant love I have for you.
But if anyone has caused grief, he has not so much grieved me as he has grieved all of you, to some extent, in order not to overstate the burden.
This punishment by the majority is sufficient for such a person.
so you should rather forgive and comfort him, so that he may not be overwhelmed by excessive sorrow.
Therefore, I urge you to reaffirm your love for him.
For this reason, I also wrote to you, to see if you would prove your obedience in all things.
And if you forgive anyone, I also forgive. For what I have forgiven, if I have forgiven anything, it is for your sake in the presence of Christ.
so that we would not be outwitted by Satan; for we are not unaware of his designs.
Now when I came to Troas to preach the gospel of Christ, and a door was opened for me in the Lord,
I had no rest for my spirit, because I did not find my brother Titus there. So I took my leave of them and went on to Macedonia.
But thanks be to God, who always leads us in triumphal procession in Christ and manifests through us the sweet aroma of the knowledge of Him in every place.
For we are the aroma of Christ to God among those who are being saved and among those who are perishing.
To some, we are the fragrance of death leading to death; to others, the fragrance of life leading to life. And who is adequate for such a task?
For we are not like many who peddle the word of God; rather, we speak with sincerity, as from God, and in the presence of God, we speak in Christ.
Are we beginning to commend ourselves again? Or do we need, like some, letters of recommendation to you or from you?
You yourselves are our letter, inscribed in our hearts, known and read by all people.
You show that you are a letter from Christ, delivered by us, inscribed not with ink, but with the Spirit of the living God; not on tablets of stone, but on tablets of human hearts.
Such confidence we have through Christ toward God.
Not that we are sufficient in ourselves to claim anything as coming from us, but our sufficiency is from God.
He has made us sufficient as ministers of a new covenant, not of the letter, but of the Spirit; for the letter kills, but the Spirit gives life.
But if the ministry that brought death, engraved in letters on stones, came with such glory that the children of Israel could not gaze steadily at the face of Moses because of the glory that was fading away,
How much more glorious will the ministry of the Spirit be?
For if the ministry that brought condemnation was glorious, how much more glorious is the ministry that brings righteousness!
Indeed, the glory that was once splendid is no longer regarded as such because of the surpassing glory that has come.
For if what was being brought to an end came with glory, much more will what is permanent be filled with glory.
Having such a hope, we use great boldness in our speech.
And we are not like Moses, who put a veil over his face so that the children of Israel would not gaze at the end of what was passing away.
But their minds were hardened; for to this day the same veil remains unlifted when they read the old covenant, because it is only in Christ that it is taken away.
But to this day, whenever Moses is read, a veil lies over their hearts.
But whenever one turns to the Lord, the veil is taken away.
Now, the Lord is the Spirit, and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom.
But we all, with unveiled faces, reflecting the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image from glory to glory, just as by the Spirit of the Lord.
Therefore, having this ministry as we have received mercy, we do not lose heart.
But we have renounced the hidden things of shame, not walking in craftiness nor handling the word of God deceitfully, but by the manifestation of the truth, we commend ourselves to every man's conscience in the sight of God.
But if our gospel is veiled, it is veiled to those who are perishing.
In them, the god of this age has blinded the minds of the unbelievers so that they cannot see the light of the gospel of the glory of Christ, who is the image of God.
For we do not proclaim ourselves, but Jesus Christ as Lord; and ourselves as your servants for Jesus’ sake.
For God, who said, 'Let light shine out of darkness,' has shone in our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ.
But we have this treasure in clay jars, so that the surpassing power belongs to God and not to us.
We are afflicted in every way, but not crushed; perplexed, but not driven to despair.
Persecuted, but not forsaken; struck down, but not destroyed.
Always carrying in our bodies the death of the Lord Jesus, so that the life of Jesus may also be revealed in our bodies.
For we who live are always being given over to death for Jesus' sake, so that the life of Jesus may be made manifest in our mortal bodies.
So death is at work in us, but life is at work in you.
And since we have the same spirit of faith as described in Scripture, 'I believed, therefore I spoke,' we also believe, and therefore we speak.
Knowing that He who raised the Lord Jesus will also raise us with Jesus and present us with you.
For all things are for your sake, so that as grace extends to more and more people, it may increase thanksgiving to the glory of God.
Therefore, we do not lose heart. Though our outer self is wasting away, our inner self is being renewed day by day.
For this light and momentary affliction is preparing for us an eternal weight of glory beyond all comparison.
So we do not fix our gaze on the things that are seen, but on the things that are unseen; for the things that are seen are temporary, but the things that are unseen are eternal.
For we know that if our earthly house, this tent, is destroyed, we have a building from God, a house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens.
For in this earthly existence, we long to be clothed with our heavenly dwelling,
If indeed we are found not naked when we have been clothed.
For indeed, while we are in this earthly tent, we groan, longing to be clothed with our heavenly dwelling, not wanting to be stripped away, but rather to be fully covered, so that mortality may be swallowed up by life.
Now the One who has prepared us for this very purpose is God, who has given us the Spirit as a deposit guaranteeing what is to come.
Therefore, we are always confident, knowing that while we are at home in the body, we are away from the Lord.
For we walk by faith, not by sight.
We are confident, yes, well pleased rather to be absent from the body and to be present with the Lord.
Therefore, we make it our aim, whether at home or away, to be well-pleasing to Him.
For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ, so that each one may receive what is due for the things done while in the body, whether good or bad.
Knowing therefore the fear of the Lord, we persuade men; but we are made manifest to God, and I hope that we are also made manifest in your consciences.
For we are not again commending ourselves to you, but are giving you an occasion to boast about us, so that you may have an answer for those who boast in outward appearance and not in heart.
For if we are beside ourselves, it is for God; if we are in our right mind, it is for you.
For the love of Christ compels us, because we have concluded this: that one has died for all, therefore all have died.
And he died for all, that those who live might no longer live for themselves, but for him who for their sake died and was raised.
So from now on, we regard no one according to the flesh. Even though we once regarded Christ in this way, we no longer do so.
Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation; the old has passed away; behold, the new has come!
But all things are from God, who reconciled us to Himself through Jesus Christ and gave us the ministry of reconciliation.
that is, God was in Christ reconciling the world to Himself, not counting their trespasses against them, and He has entrusted to us the message of reconciliation.
Therefore, we are ambassadors for Christ, as though God were making His appeal through us. We implore you on behalf of Christ, be reconciled to God.
For He made the One who knew no sin to be sin for us, that we might become the righteousness of God in Him.
As fellow workers with Him, we urge you not to receive the grace of God in vain.
For He says, 'In a time of favor, I listened to you, and in a day of salvation, I helped you.' Behold, now is the accepted time; behold, now is the day of salvation.
We put no obstacle in anyone’s way, so that no fault may be found with our ministry.
But in every way, we commend ourselves as servants of God; through great endurance, in afflictions, in hardships, and in calamities.
in beatings, in imprisonments, in tumultuous situations, in labors, in sleepless nights, in fasts;
in purity, in knowledge, in patience, in kindness, in the Holy Spirit, in sincere love,
in the word of truth, in the power of God, through the weapons of righteousness in the right hand and in the left.
through glory and dishonor, through slander and praise; we are regarded as impostors, and yet are true.
as unknown, yet well-known; as dying, and behold, we live; as punished, yet not killed.
as sorrowful, yet always rejoicing; as poor, yet enriching many; as having nothing, yet possessing all things.
Our mouth is open wide to you, O Corinthians; our heart is filled with affection for you.
You are not restricted by us, but you are restricted by your own affections.
In return, I speak as to children: open wide your hearts also.
Do not be unequally yoked with unbelievers; for what partnership has righteousness with lawlessness? Or what fellowship has light with darkness?
And what accord has Christ with Belial? Or what portion does a believer share with an unbeliever?
And what agreement has the temple of God with idols? For we are the temple of the living God; as God said, 'I will make my dwelling among them and walk among them, and I will be their God, and they shall be my people.'
Therefore, come out from among them and be separate, says the Lord. Touch no unclean thing, and I will receive you.
And I will be a Father to you, and you shall be My sons and daughters, says the Lord Almighty.
Therefore, beloved, since we have these promises, let us cleanse ourselves from every defilement of body and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God.
Make room for us in your hearts; we have wronged no one, we have corrupted no one, we have exploited no one.
I do not say this to condemn you; for I have said before that you are in our hearts, to die together and to live together.
I have great confidence in you; I have much to boast about regarding you. I am filled with comfort, and my joy overflows in all our afflictions.
For indeed, when we came to Macedonia, we had no rest for our bodies, but were afflicted in every way; outside were conflicts, inside were fears.
But God, who comforts the humble, encouraged us by the coming of Titus.
Not only by his coming, but also by the comfort with which he was comforted in you, as he told us of your longing, your sorrow, and your zeal for me, so that I rejoiced even more.
For even if I made you sorrowful by my letter, I do not regret it, though I did regret it at first; for I see that the letter has caused you grief, though only for a while.
Now I rejoice, not because you were made sorrowful, but because your sorrow led to repentance. For you were grieved in a way that was pleasing to God, so that you suffered no loss from us.
For godly grief produces a repentance that leads to salvation without regret, while worldly grief produces death.
See how this godly sorrow has produced in you earnestness, an eagerness to clear yourselves, indignation, fear, longing, zeal, and vengeance! In every way you have demonstrated yourselves to be innocent in this matter.
So even if I wrote to you, it was not because of the one who did wrong, nor because of the one who was wronged, but to make evident your earnestness for us before God.
Therefore we were comforted. And in addition to our comfort, we rejoiced even more at the joy of Titus, because his spirit has been refreshed by all of you.
For if I have boasted to him about you in any way, I was not put to shame; but just as everything we said to you was true, so also our boasting before Titus has proven to be true.
And his affections for you are even greater, as he remembers the obedience of you all, how you received him with fear and trembling.
I rejoice because I have complete confidence in you.
Now, brothers, we want you to know about the grace of God that has been bestowed upon the churches of Macedonia.
In the midst of a great trial of affliction, their abundance of joy and their deep poverty have overflowed into a wealth of generosity.
For I testify that according to their ability, and even beyond their ability, they gave of their own accord.
They urgently pleaded with us for the privilege of sharing in this service to the saints.
And they did not do as we had hoped, but they gave themselves first to the Lord and then to us, in accordance with God’s will.
So we urged Titus that, just as he had started before, he should also complete this act of grace among you.
But just as you excel in everything—in faith, in speech, in knowledge, in all diligence, and in your love for us—see that you also excel in this act of grace.
I am not commanding you, but I am testing the sincerity of your love by the eagerness of others.
For you know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that though He was rich, yet for your sakes He became poor, so that you through His poverty might become rich.
And in this matter, I give my opinion: it is to your advantage, since you not only began to act on this a year ago but also to desire it.
But now finish the task you began, so that just as you were eager to desire it, you may also be eager to bring it to completion from what you have.
For if there is a willing mind, it is accepted according to what one has, not according to what he does not have.
For it is not that others should be eased and you burdened, but that there may be equality; your surplus at the present time should supply their need, so that their abundance may supply your need, that there may be equality.
so that their surplus may meet your lack, that there may be fairness,
As it is written, 'The one who gathered much did not have too much, and the one who gathered little did not have too little.'
But thanks be to God, who has put into the heart of Titus the same earnest care for you.
For he accepted our appeal, and being very eager, he went forth on his own accord to visit you.
And we have sent along with him the brother whose praise is in the Gospel throughout all the churches.
Not only that, but he was also appointed by the churches as our fellow traveler, along with this grace that is being ministered by us, for the glory of the Lord and our eagerness.
We are making this arrangement to ensure that no one will blame us for the generosity that is being administered by us.
For we aim to do what is honorable not only in the Lord’s sight but also in the sight of men.
And we have sent with him our brother, whom we have tested many times and found to be diligent, and now much more diligent because of his great confidence in you.
As for Titus, he is my partner and fellow worker among you; as for our brothers, they are representatives of the churches, bringing glory to Christ.
So show them the proof of your love and of our boasting about you before the churches.
Now, concerning the service to the saints, it is unnecessary for me to write to you.
For I know your readiness, of which I boast about you to the Macedonians, that Achaia has been prepared since last year; and your zeal has stirred up the majority.
But I have sent the brothers, so that our boasting about you may not be in vain in this matter, but that you may be prepared, just as I said you would be.
Otherwise, if the Macedonians come with me and find you unprepared, we—not to mention you—would be humiliated in this undertaking, as we had previously boasted about you.
Therefore, I thought it necessary to urge the brothers to go to you in advance and prepare your promised gift, so that it may be ready as a blessing, not as something obtained by greed.
But this I say: He who sows sparingly will also reap sparingly, and he who sows generously will also reap generously.
Each one must give as he has decided in his heart, not reluctantly or under compulsion, for God loves a cheerful giver.
And God is able to make all grace abound toward you, so that in all things, at all times, having all that you need, you may overflow in every good work.
As it is written: ‘He has scattered abroad; he has given to the poor; his righteousness endures forever.’
Now He who supplies seed to the sower and bread for food will supply and multiply your seed for sowing and increase the harvest of your righteousness.
You will be enriched in every way for all generosity, which produces thanksgiving to God through us.
For the ministry of this service is not only supplying the needs of the saints, but is also overflowing in many thanksgivings to God.
Through the proof of this ministry, they will glorify God for your obedience to the confession of the gospel of Christ and for your generous sharing with them and with all.
And their hearts will long for you, as they pray for you, because of the surpassing grace of God that has been bestowed upon you.
Thanks be to God for His indescribable gift!
Now I, Paul, appeal to you by the gentleness and humility of Christ, who is meek in presence among you, but bold toward you when absent.
But I ask that when I am present, I may not have to be bold with that confidence by which I intend to challenge some who think of us as if we walked according to the flesh.
For though we walk in the flesh, we do not wage war according to the flesh.
For the weapons of our warfare are not of the flesh, but are mighty through God for the pulling down of strongholds.
We destroy arguments and every lofty opinion raised against the knowledge of God, and take every thought captive to obey Christ.
And we are ready to punish every act of disobedience, once your obedience is complete.
You are looking at outward appearances! If anyone is confident that he belongs to Christ, let him consider again that just as he is Christ's, so too are we.
For even if I boast somewhat abundantly about our authority, which the Lord gave us for building you up and not for tearing you down, I will not be ashamed.
I do not want it to seem as though I am trying to frighten you through my letters.
For it is said, 'His letters are weighty and powerful, but his physical presence is weak, and his speech is of no account.'
Let such a one consider this: that just as we are in word through letters when absent, so also we will be in action when present.
For we do not dare to classify or compare ourselves with some who commend themselves; but when they measure themselves by themselves and compare themselves with themselves, they do not understand.
But we will not boast beyond our proper limit, but will keep our boast within the sphere of influence that God has assigned to us, a sphere that includes you.
For we are not overreaching in our boasting, as though we were not reaching you; for we were the first to come all the way to you with the gospel of Christ.
We do not boast beyond measure in the labors of others, but we have hope that as your faith grows, we will be greatly honored among you, according to our measure, in abundance.
to proclaim the gospel in regions beyond you, not to boast in another's sphere of achievement.
But let the one who boasts boast in the Lord.
For it is not the one who commends himself who is approved, but the one whom the Lord commends.
Oh, that you would bear with me in a little foolishness! Indeed, you are bearing with me!
For I am jealous for you with a godly jealousy; for I have betrothed you to one husband, to present you as a pure virgin to Christ.
But I fear that, just as the serpent deceived Eve by his cunning, your minds may be led astray from the simplicity and purity that is in Christ.
For if someone comes and preaches another Jesus whom we have not preached, or if you receive a different spirit which you have not received, or a different gospel which you have not accepted, you bear with it well.
For I consider that I am not in the least inferior to those super-apostles.
But even if I am unskilled in speaking, I am not in knowledge; rather, we have been made evident in every way to you in all things.
Or did I commit a sin by humbling myself so that you might be exalted, because I preached the Gospel of God to you without charge?
I robbed other churches by receiving support for my ministry while serving you, and when I was with you and needed, I did not burden anyone.
And when the brothers from Macedonia arrived, they fully supplied my needs; and in every way, I kept myself from being a burden to you, and I will continue to do so.
As surely as the truth of Christ is in me, this boast of mine will not be silenced in the regions of Achaia.
Why? Because I do not love you? God knows!
But what I am doing, I will continue to do, in order to cut off the opportunity from those who desire an opportunity, so that in the matter for which they boast, they may be found just as we are.
For such men are false apostles, deceitful workers, disguising themselves as apostles of Christ.
And no wonder, for Satan himself masquerades as an angel of light.
Therefore, it is no great surprise if his servants also transform themselves into servants of righteousness. Their end will correspond to their deeds.
Again, I say, let no one think me foolish; but if you do, receive me as a fool, so that I may boast a little.
What I say, I do not speak as if from the Lord, but as in foolishness, in this confidence of boasting.
Since many boast according to the flesh, I too will boast.
For you gladly tolerate fools, being wise yourselves.
For you bear with it if someone enslaves you, if someone devours you, if someone takes advantage of you, if someone is arrogant toward you, if someone strikes you in the face.
To my shame, I speak as though we were weak. But in whatever anyone dares to boast, I also dare to speak, though it is with foolishness.
Are they Hebrews? So am I. Are they Israelites? So am I. Are they descendants of Abraham? So am I.
Are they servants of Christ? I am speaking as a madman—I am a better one; with far more labors, far more imprisonments, countless beatings, and often near death.
Five times I received from the Jews the forty lashes minus one.
Three times I was beaten with rods, once I was stoned, three times I suffered shipwreck; a night and a day I spent adrift at sea.
I have been in journeys often, in dangers from rivers, in dangers from robbers, in dangers from my own countrymen, in dangers from the Gentiles, in dangers in the city, in dangers in the wilderness, in dangers at sea, and in dangers among false brethren.
In toil and hardship, in sleeplessness often, in hunger and thirst, in fasting often, in cold and nakedness;.
Besides the external trials, my daily burden is the care I feel for all the churches.
Who is weak, and I am not weak? Who is made to stumble, and I do not burn with indignation?
If I must boast, I will boast of the things that show my weakness.
The God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who is blessed forever, knows that I am not lying.
In Damascus, the governor Aretas, appointed by the king, was guarding the city of the Damascenes, wanting to seize me.
And I was let down through a window in a basket, slipping through the wall, thus I escaped his hands.
It is necessary for me to go on boasting, although it is not profitable for me; I will move on to visions and revelations from the Lord.
I know a man in Christ who fourteen years ago was caught up to the third heaven; whether in the body or out of the body, I do not know; God knows.
And I know such a man; whether in the body or out of the body, I cannot tell; God knows.
that he was caught up into paradise and heard inexpressible words, which it is not lawful for a man to speak.
On behalf of such a one I will boast, but on my own account I will not boast, except of my weaknesses.
For if I wished to boast, I would not be foolish; for I would speak the truth. But I refrain, so that no one may regard me beyond what they see in me or hear from me.
And because of the abundance of the revelations, to keep me from becoming proud, there was given to me a thorn in the flesh, a messenger of Satan to buffet me, lest I be exalted above measure.
Concerning this, I pleaded with the Lord three times to take it away from me.
But He said to me, "My grace is sufficient for you, for My power is made perfect in weakness." Therefore, I will boast all the more gladly of my weaknesses, so that the power of Christ may rest upon me.
Therefore, I take pleasure in my weaknesses, in insults, in hardships, in persecutions, and in distresses for Christ's sake; for when I am weak, then I am strong.
I have become a fool in boasting; you have compelled me. For I ought to have been commended by you, since I am not in the least inferior to the most eminent apostles, even though I am nothing.
The signs of a true apostle were performed among you with utmost patience, with signs and wonders and mighty deeds.
For what is it that you were less favored than the rest of the churches, except that I myself did not burden you? Forgive me this wrong.
Look, I am ready to visit you for the third time, and I will not be a burden to you; for what I desire is not your possessions, but you. After all, children should not have to save up for their parents, but parents for their children.
And I will gladly spend and be utterly spent for your souls; even if I love you more abundantly, I am loved less.
But let it be known that I did not burden you, yet being crafty, I took you in by deceit.
Did I take advantage of you through any of those I sent to you?
I urged Titus to go, and I sent our brother with him. Did Titus take advantage of you? Did we not walk in the same spirit? Did we not walk in the same footsteps?
Have you been thinking that we are defending ourselves to you? We speak before God in Christ; and all things, beloved, are for your edification.
For I fear that when I come, I may not find you as I wish, and that you may not find me as you wish; I fear there may be strife, jealousy, anger, rivalry, slander, gossip, arrogance, and disorder among you.
I am afraid that when I come again, my God may humble me before you, and I may mourn over many of those who have sinned previously and have not repented of the impurity, sexual immorality, and sensuality they have practiced.
This is the third time I am coming to you. Every charge must be established by the testimony of two or three witnesses.
I have previously stated and now repeat, as I was present the second time, and now write to those who have sinned previously and to all the rest, that if I come again, I will not spare anyone.
Since you seek a demonstration of Christ speaking in me, He who is not weak toward you, but powerful among you.
For though He was crucified in weakness, yet He lives by the power of God; for we also are weak in Him, but we will live with Him by the power of God toward you.
Examine yourselves to see whether you are in the faith; test yourselves. Do you not realize that Jesus Christ is in you? Unless, indeed, you fail the test.
But I hope you will recognize that we are not disqualified.
Now I pray to God that you do no wrong, not so that we may appear approved, but that you may do what is good, even if we may be regarded as unapproved.
For we cannot do anything against the truth, but only for the truth.
For we rejoice when we are weak and you are strong; and this is what we pray for, your restoration.
Therefore, while I am absent, I write these things so that when I come, I may not have to be severe in my use of the authority that the Lord has given me for building up and not for tearing down.
Finally, brothers and sisters, rejoice! Aim for restoration, encourage one another, be of one mind, live in peace; and the God of love and peace will be with you.
Greet one another with a holy kiss. All the saints greet you.
The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all. Amen.
Paul, an apostle—not sent from men nor through a man, but through Jesus Christ and God the Father who raised Him from the dead.
and all the brothers who are with me, to the churches of Galatia:
Grace and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
who gave Himself for our sins, so that He might rescue us from this present evil age, according to the will of our God and Father.
to whom be glory forever and ever. Amen.
I am astonished that you are so quickly turning away from the one who called you in the grace of Christ to a different gospel.
which is not another; but there are some who trouble you and want to pervert the gospel of Christ.
But even if we or an angel from heaven should preach to you a gospel contrary to the one we preached to you, let him be accursed.
As we have said before, so now I say again: If anyone preaches to you a gospel different from the one you received, let him be under a curse.
Am I now trying to win the favor of men, or of God? Or am I striving to please men? If I were still trying to please men, I would not be a servant of Christ.
But I want you to know, brothers, that the gospel I preached is not of human origin; it is divine in nature.
For I did not receive it from any human source, nor was I taught it; rather, it came to me through a revelation of Jesus Christ.
For you have heard of my former conduct in Judaism, how intensely I persecuted the church of God and sought to destroy it.
And I advanced in Judaism beyond many of my contemporaries, being more exceedingly zealous for the traditions of my fathers.
But when God, who set me apart from my mother’s womb and called me by His grace, was pleased to reveal His Son in me,
to reveal His Son in me, so that I might preach Him among the Gentiles. Immediately I did not consult with flesh and blood.
nor did I go up to Jerusalem to those who were apostles before me, but I went away to Arabia, and then returned again to Damascus.
Then, after three years, I went up to Jerusalem to get acquainted with Peter, and I stayed with him for fifteen days.
But I saw no other apostle except James, the Lord’s brother.
Now, what I write to you, behold, before God I declare that I do not lie.
Then I went to the regions of Syria and Cilicia.
And I was still unknown in person to the churches of Judea that are in Christ.
They were only hearing that the one who once persecuted us is now preaching the faith that he once tried to destroy.
And they glorified God because of me.
Then, after a span of fourteen years, I went up again to Jerusalem with Barnabas, taking Titus along with me.
I went up in response to a revelation, and I presented to them the gospel that I preach among the Gentiles; but I did so privately to those who seemed to be influential, lest by any means I might be running or had run in vain.
But not even Titus, who was with me, being a Greek, was compelled to be circumcised.
Yet because of the false brothers secretly brought in, who slipped in to spy out our freedom that we have in Christ Jesus, in order to bring us into bondage; 
To them we did not yield in submission, even for a moment, so that the truth of the gospel might remain with you.
But from those who seemed to be something, whatever they were makes no difference to me; God shows no favoritism, for those who seemed influential added nothing to me.
On the contrary, when they saw that I had been entrusted with the gospel for the uncircumcised, just as Peter had been for the circumcised.
For the one who worked through Peter in his apostleship to the circumcised was also active in me for the Gentiles.
And when they recognized the grace that had been given to me, James, Cephas, and John, who were esteemed as pillars, gave to me and Barnabas the right hand of fellowship, that we should go to the Gentiles, and they to the circumcised.
Only they asked us to remember the poor, the very thing I was eager to do.
But when Peter came to Antioch, I opposed him to his face, because he stood condemned.
For before certain men came from James, he used to eat with the Gentiles; but when they arrived, he drew back and separated himself, fearing those who belonged to the circumcision.
And the rest of the Jews joined him in hypocrisy, so that even Barnabas was led astray by their pretense.
But when I saw that they were not walking in line with the truth of the gospel, I said to Peter in front of everyone, 'If you, though you are a Jew, live like a Gentile and not like a Jew, how is it then that you force Gentiles to follow Jewish customs?'
We are Jews by birth and not Gentile sinners.
Knowing that a person is not justified by the works of the law, but through faith in Jesus Christ, we also have believed in Christ Jesus, so that we might be justified by faith in Christ and not by the works of the law, because by works of the law no flesh will be justified.
But if, while seeking to be justified in Christ, we are found to be sinners, is Christ then a servant of sin? Absolutely not!
For if I rebuild what I have torn down, I prove myself to be a transgressor.
For I, through the law, have died to the law, that I might live to God.
I have been crucified with Christ; it is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me. And the life I now live in the flesh, I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave Himself for me.
I do not nullify the grace of God, for if righteousness could be gained through the law, then Christ died for nothing.
O foolish Galatians! Who has cast a spell on you, before whose eyes Jesus Christ was publicly portrayed as crucified?
This is the only thing I want to learn from you: Did you receive the Spirit by the works of the law, or by hearing with faith?
Are you so foolish? Having begun in the Spirit, are you now being made perfect by the flesh?
Did you suffer so many things in vain? If indeed it was in vain.
Therefore, the One who supplies you with the Spirit and performs miracles among you, does He do this by the works of the law or by the hearing of faith?
Just as Abraham believed God, and it was credited to him as righteousness.
Understand then that those who have faith are the true children of Abraham.
And the Scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the nations by faith, proclaimed the good news in advance to Abraham, saying, 'All nations will be blessed through you.'
So those who are of faith are blessed along with Abraham, the man of faith.
For all who rely on the works of the law are under a curse; for it is written, ‘Cursed is everyone who does not continue to do everything written in the Book of the Law.’
But it is evident that no one is justified before God by the law, for ‘the righteous will live by faith.’
But the law is not based on faith; rather, the one who does these things will live by them.
Christ has redeemed us from the curse of the Law by becoming a curse for us; for it is written, 'Cursed is everyone who is hung on a tree.'
so that the blessing of Abraham might come to the Gentiles through Christ Jesus, so that we might receive the promised Spirit through faith.
Brothers, I speak in human terms: even a man’s covenant, once confirmed, cannot be annulled or added to.
Now to Abraham were the promises spoken, and to his seed. It does not say, 'and to seeds,' as of many, but as of one, 'and to your seed,' who is Christ.
What I mean is this: the covenant previously ratified by God in Christ cannot be annulled by the Law that came 430 years later, so as to invalidate the promise.
For if the inheritance comes from the Law, it no longer comes from the promise; but God granted it to Abraham by a promise.
What then is the purpose of the Law? It was added for the sake of transgressions, until the promised Seed should come, being ordained through angels by the hand of a mediator.
Now a mediator does not mediate for one only, but God is one.
Is the law then against the promises of God? Absolutely not! For if a law had been given that could impart life, then righteousness would certainly have come by the law.
But the Scriptures have confined all things under sin, so that the promise might be given through faith in Jesus Christ to those who believe.
But before faith came, we were held in custody under the law, being confined until the faith that was to be revealed.
So the law became our tutor to lead us to Christ, that we might be justified by faith.
But now that faith has come, we are no longer under a guardian.
For you are all children of God through faith in Christ Jesus.
For as many of you as were baptized into Christ have clothed yourselves with Christ.
There is neither Jew nor Greek, slave nor free, male nor female; for you are all one in Christ Jesus.
And if you belong to Christ, then you are Abraham's seed, heirs according to the promise.
I mean that as long as the heir is a child, he is no different from a slave, though he is the owner of everything.
but is under guardians and stewards until the time set by the father.
So also we, when we were children, were held in bondage under the elemental principles of the world.
But when the fullness of time had come, God sent forth His Son, born of a woman, born under the law.
to redeem those who were under the law, that we might receive the adoption as sons.
And because you are sons, God has sent forth the Spirit of His Son into your hearts, crying out, 'Abba, Father!'
Therefore, you are no longer a slave, but a son; and if a son, then an heir of God through Christ.
But at that time, when you did not know God, you served those who by nature are not gods.
But now that you have come to know God, or rather are known by God, how can you turn back again to the weak and worthless elementary principles, to which you want to be enslaved all over again?
You observe days and months and seasons and years!
I am concerned for you, lest my labor among you should be in vain.
Become like me, for I became like you, brothers; I beg you. You have not wronged me at all.
You know that it was because of a physical infirmity that I preached the gospel to you at the first.
And you did not despise or reject my trial that was in my flesh; instead, you welcomed me as if I were an angel of God, as if I were Christ Jesus himself.
What then has become of your blessedness? For I testify that, if possible, you would have gouged out your eyes and given them to me.
So have I become your enemy by telling you the truth?
They are zealous for you, but not for good; they wish to shut you out, so that you may be zealous for them.
But it is good to be zealous for a good cause at all times, and not just when I am present with you.
My dear children, for whom I am again in the pains of childbirth until Christ is fully formed in you!
I wish I could be present with you now and change my tone, for I am perplexed about you.
Tell me, you who desire to be under the law, do you not listen to the law?
For it is written that Abraham had two sons, one by the bondwoman and the other by the freewoman.
But the one who was born of the bondwoman was born according to the flesh, and the one who was born of the freewoman was born through the promise.
These things are being interpreted allegorically. For these women are two covenants: one from Mount Sinai, which gives birth to slavery; this is Hagar.
For Hagar is Mount Sinai in Arabia; and she corresponds to the present Jerusalem, for she is in slavery with her children.
But the Jerusalem that is above is free, and she is our mother.
For it is written: "Rejoice, O barren one who does not bear; break forth and cry aloud, you who are not in labor! For the children of the desolate will be more than those of the one who has a husband."
Now you, brothers, like Isaac, are children of promise.
But just as at that time the one born according to the flesh persecuted the one born according to the Spirit, so it is now.
But what does the Scripture say? "Cast out the slave woman and her son; for the son of the slave woman shall not inherit with the son of the free woman."
Therefore, brothers, we are not children of the bondwoman, but of the free woman.
For freedom Christ has set us free; stand firm therefore, and do not submit again to a yoke of slavery.
Look, I, Paul, say to you that if you accept circumcision, Christ will be of no benefit to you.
And I testify again to every man who accepts circumcision, that he is obligated to keep the whole law.
You are severed from Christ, you who would be justified by the law; you have fallen away from grace.
For we, by the Spirit, await the hope of righteousness through faith.
For in Christ Jesus, neither circumcision nor uncircumcision counts for anything, but only faith working through love.
You were running well; who hindered you from obeying the truth?
This persuasion did not come from the one who calls you.
A little yeast leavens the entire batch of dough.
I am confident in you, in the Lord, that you will not think otherwise; but the one who is unsettling you will bear the judgment, whoever he may be.
But I, brothers, if I still preach circumcision, why am I still persecuted? In that case, the offense of the cross has been abolished.
I wish those who unsettle you would cut themselves off.
For you were called to freedom, brothers; only do not use your freedom as an opportunity for the flesh, but through love serve one another.
For the entire law is fulfilled in one word: ‘You shall love your neighbor as yourself.’
But if you bite and devour one another, watch out that you are not consumed by one another.
But I say, walk by the Spirit, and you will not fulfill the desires of the flesh.
For the flesh desires what is contrary to the Spirit, and the Spirit desires what is contrary to the flesh; these are in opposition to each other, so that you do not do what you would like to do.
But if you are guided by the Spirit, you are not under the law.
Now the deeds of the flesh are evident, which include adultery, fornication, uncleanness, and sensuality.
idolatry, sorcery, enmities, strife, jealousy, fits of anger, rivalries, dissensions, factions,
envy, murder, drunkenness, revelries, and other things like these, of which I forewarn you, as I also forewarned you before, that those who practice such things will not inherit the kingdom of God.
But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness.
gentleness, self-control; against such things there is no law.
And those who belong to Christ have crucified the flesh along with its passions and desires.
If we live by the Spirit, let us also walk in the Spirit.
Let us not become conceited, provoking one another, envying one another.
Brothers, if anyone is caught in any transgression, you who are spiritual should restore him in a spirit of gentleness. Keep watch on yourself, lest you too be tempted.
Bear one another’s burdens, and so fulfill the law of Christ.
For if anyone thinks he is something when he is nothing, he deceives himself.
But let each one examine his own work, and then he will have rejoicing in himself alone, and not in another.
For each one will bear his own load.
Let the one who is taught the word share all good things with the one who teaches.
Do not be deceived; God is not mocked, for whatever a person sows, that will he also reap.
For the one who sows to his own flesh will from the flesh reap corruption, but the one who sows to the Spirit will from the Spirit reap eternal life.
And let us not grow weary in doing good, for in due season we will reap if we do not lose heart.
So then, as we have the opportunity, let us do good to everyone, especially to those who are of the household of faith.
See with what large letters I have written to you with my own hand.
As many as desire to make a good showing in the flesh, they compel you to be circumcised, only that they may not suffer persecution for the cross of Christ.
For neither do those who are circumcised keep the law themselves, but they desire to have you circumcised, that they may boast in your flesh.
But far be it from me to boast except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom the world has been crucified to me, and I to the world.
For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision nor uncircumcision has any value, but only a new creation.
And as many as walk by this rule, peace and mercy be upon them, and upon the Israel of God.
From now on, let no one cause me trouble, for I bear the scars of the Lord Jesus on my body.
The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit, brothers; amen.
Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God, to the saints who are in Ephesus, and to the faithful in Christ Jesus.
Grace be unto you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly realms in Christ.
Just as He chose us in Him before the foundation of the world to be holy and blameless in His sight, in love.
He predestined us for adoption as His children through Jesus Christ, according to the purpose of His will.
to the praise of the glory of His grace, by which He has graced us in the Beloved.
In Him, we have the redemption through His blood, the forgiveness of our trespasses, according to the riches of His grace.
which He lavished upon us with all wisdom and insight.
He made known to us the mystery of His will, according to His good pleasure that He purposed in Christ.
to bring together in one all things in Christ, both things in heaven and things on earth, in Him.
In Him we were also chosen, having been predestined according to the plan of Him who works out everything in conformity with the purpose of His will.
so that we, who were the first to hope in Christ, might be for the praise of His glory.
In Him, you also, after hearing the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation, and having believed in Him, were sealed with the promised Holy Spirit.
who is the guarantee of our inheritance, until the redemption of the purchased possession, to the praise of His glory.
For this reason, I too, having heard of your faith in the Lord Jesus and your love for all the saints,
I do not cease giving thanks for you, making mention of you in my prayers.
that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may grant you a spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of Him.
Having the eyes of your heart enlightened, so that you may know what is the hope of His calling, and what are the riches of the glory of His inheritance in the saints.
and what is the surpassing greatness of His power toward us who believe, according to the working of the strength of His might,
which He worked in Christ when He raised Him from the dead and seated Him at His right hand in the heavenly places.
far above all rule and authority and power and dominion, and every name that is named, not only in this age but also in the one to come.
And He placed all things under His feet and gave Him as head over all things to the church.
which is His body, the fullness of Him who fills all in all.
And you were dead in your transgressions and sins,
in which you once walked, following the course of this world, following the prince of the power of the air, the spirit that is now at work in the sons of disobedience;
Among them, we all once lived in the passions of our flesh, fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind, and were by nature children of wrath, like the rest of mankind.
But God, being rich in mercy, because of the great love with which He loved us.
even when we were dead in our trespasses, He made us alive together with Christ; by grace you have been saved.
and He raised us up with Him and seated us with Him in the heavenly places in Christ Jesus,
so that in the coming ages He might show the immeasurable riches of His grace in kindness toward us in Christ Jesus.
For by grace you have been saved through faith; and this is not of yourselves; it is the gift of God.
not of works, so that no one may boast.
For we are His masterpiece, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared beforehand so that we may walk in them.
Therefore, remember that formerly you, who are Gentiles by birth and called 'uncircumcised' by those who call themselves 'the circumcised' (which is done in the flesh by human hands),
remember that at that time you were without Christ, excluded from the citizenship of Israel, and strangers to the covenants of promise, having no hope and without God in the world.
But now in Christ Jesus, you who once were far away have been brought near by the blood of Christ.
For He Himself is our peace, who has made both one and has broken down the middle wall of separation.
Abolishing in His flesh the hostility that is the law of commandments contained in ordinances, so that He might create in Himself one new man from the two, thus establishing peace.
and might reconcile both of them into one body to God through the cross, having slain the enmity in Himself.
And coming, He proclaimed peace to you who were far off and peace to those who were near.
For through Him, we both have access by one Spirit to the Father.
Consequently, you are no longer strangers and foreigners, but fellow citizens with the saints and members of God's household.
built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, with Christ Jesus himself being the cornerstone.
In whom the whole building, being fitted together, grows into a holy temple in the Lord.
In Him you are also being built together into a dwelling place for God by the Spirit.
For this reason, I, Paul, a prisoner of Christ Jesus on behalf of you Gentiles,
Surely you have heard of the stewardship of God’s grace that was given to me for you,
That by revelation, He made known to me the mystery, as I have briefly written to you before.
When you read this, you will be able to perceive my insight into the mystery of Christ.
This mystery was not made known to previous generations of mankind as it has now been revealed to His holy apostles and prophets through the Spirit.
This is that the Gentiles are to be fellow heirs, one body, and partakers of His promise in Christ through the gospel.
Of this gospel, I became a minister by the gift of God's grace, which was given to me according to the working of His power.
To me, the very least of all the saints, this grace was given, to preach to the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ.
and to enlighten everyone about the stewardship of the mystery that has been hidden from the ages in God, who created all things through Jesus Christ.
so that the manifold wisdom of God might now be made known to the rulers and authorities in the heavenly places through the church.
This was in accordance with the eternal purpose that He accomplished in Christ Jesus our Lord.
In Him, we have boldness and confident access through faith in Him.
Therefore, I ask you not to lose heart because of my sufferings on your behalf, which are your glory.
For this reason, I bow my knees before the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,
from whom every family in heaven and on earth derives its name,
that he may grant you, according to the riches of his glory, to be strengthened with might by his Spirit in the inner man,
so that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith; and that you, being rooted and grounded in love,
may be empowered to comprehend, along with all the saints, the vast dimensions of God's love—its width, length, depth, and height.
and to know the love of Christ that surpasses knowledge, that you may be filled with all the fullness of God.
Now to Him who is able to do far more abundantly than all that we ask or think, according to the power that is at work within us,
To Him be glory in the Church and in Christ Jesus throughout all generations, forever and ever. Amen.
I therefore urge you, I who am a prisoner in the Lord, to walk in a manner worthy of the calling to which you have been called.
With all humility and gentleness, with patience, bearing with one another in love,
Make every effort to maintain the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace.
There is one body and one Spirit, just as you were called to the one hope that belongs to your calling.
One Lord, one faith, one baptism.
One God and Father of all, who is above all, and through all, and in all of us.
But to each one of us, grace was given according to the measure of Christ’s gift.
Therefore, it says: ‘When he ascended on high, he led captive a host of captives and gave gifts to men.’
Now, what does ‘he ascended’ mean, except that he also descended first into the lower regions of the earth?
He who descended is the very one who ascended far above all the heavens, that he might fill all things.
And He Himself gave some to be apostles, some prophets, some evangelists, some shepherds, and some teachers.
for the equipping of the saints for the work of ministry, for the building up of the body of Christ,
until we all reach unity in the faith and in the knowledge of the Son of God, becoming a mature man, attaining to the whole measure of the fullness of Christ.
So that we may no longer be children, tossed to and fro by the waves, and carried about by every wind of doctrine, by human cunning, by craftiness in deceitful schemes.
But speaking the truth in love, let us grow up in every way into Him who is the head, Christ.
From whom the whole body, being joined and held together by every joint that aids in its growth, according to the working of each individual part, causes the body to grow and builds itself up in love.
Therefore, I say this and affirm together with you in the Lord, that you no longer walk as the Gentiles do, in the futility of their minds.
They are darkened in their understanding, alienated from the life of God because of the ignorance that is in them due to the hardness of their hearts.
They have become callous, giving themselves over to sensuality, to work all manner of impurity with a relentless desire for more.
But you did not learn Christ in this manner.
If indeed you have heard Him and have been taught in Him, as the truth is in Jesus.
You are to put off your old self, which belongs to your former manner of life and is corrupted through deceitful desires.
and be renewed in the spirit of your minds.
and to put on the new self, created to be like God in true righteousness and holiness.
Therefore, laying aside falsehood, let each one of you speak truth with his neighbor, for we are members one of another.
In your anger, do not sin; do not let the sun go down while you are still angry.
And do not give the devil a foothold.
Let the thief no longer steal, but rather let him labor, doing honest work with his own hands, so that he may have something to share with anyone in need.
Let no corrupting talk come out of your mouths, but only such as is good for building up, as fits the occasion, that it may give grace to those who hear.
And do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God, by whom you were sealed for the day of redemption.
Let all bitterness, rage, anger, clamor, and slander be removed from you, along with every form of malice.
Instead, be kind and compassionate to one another, forgiving each other, just as in Christ God forgave you.
Therefore, be imitators of God, as beloved children.
And live in love, just as Christ loved us and gave Himself up for us as an offering and a sacrifice to God, a fragrant aroma.
But sexual immorality and all impurity or greed must not even be named among you, as is proper among saints.
Let there be no obscenity, foolish talk, or crude joking, which are out of place, but instead let there be thanksgiving.
For this you can be sure of: that no sexually immoral person, nor impure person, nor greedy person, who is an idolater, has any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God.
Let no one deceive you with empty words, for because of such things the wrath of God comes upon the children of disobedience.
Therefore, do not become partakers with them.
For you were once darkness, but now you are light in the Lord; walk as children of light.
For the fruit of the Spirit consists in all goodness, righteousness, and truth.
Carefully discern what is pleasing to the Lord.
And do not share in the fruitless works of darkness, but rather expose them.
For it is shameful even to speak of the things that they do in secret.
But all things made evident by the light are disclosed; for anything that becomes visible is light.
Therefore it is said, 'Awake, you who sleep, and arise from the dead, and Christ will shine upon you.'
See then that you walk carefully, not as unwise, but as wise.
making the most of every opportunity, because the days are wicked.
Therefore, do not be foolish, but understand what the will of the Lord is.
And do not be drunk with wine, which leads to reckless living, but be filled with the Spirit.
Speaking to one another with psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and making melody in your heart to the Lord.
Giving thanks always for all things in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ to God, even the Father.
Submitting to one another out of reverence for Christ.
Wives, submit yourselves to your own husbands as you would to the Lord.
For the husband is the head of the wife, as Christ is the head of the church, and he is the Savior of the body.
But just as the church submits to Christ, so also let wives submit to their own husbands in everything.
Husbands, love your wives just as Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her.
to sanctify her, having cleansed her by the washing of water with the word,
so that He might present her to Himself as a glorious church, not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing, but that she should be holy and without blemish.
In this way, husbands ought to love their own wives as they love their own bodies. He who loves his wife loves himself.
For no one ever hated his own flesh, but nourishes and cherishes it, just as Christ does the church.
For we are members of His body, of His flesh and of His bones.
For this reason, a man shall leave his father and mother and shall be joined to his wife, and the two shall become one flesh.
This mystery is great; but I am speaking with reference to Christ and the church.
Nevertheless, each of you must love his own wife as himself, and let the wife see that she respects her husband.
Children, obey your parents in the Lord, for this is right.
Honor your father and your mother, which is the first commandment with a promise.
so that it may go well with you, and you may live long on the earth.
And fathers, do not provoke your children to anger, but bring them up in the instruction and discipline of the Lord.
Servants, obey your earthly masters with respect and fear, and with a sincere heart, just as you would obey Christ.
Not by way of eye-service, as people-pleasers, but as servants of Christ, doing the will of God from the heart.
Serve with goodwill, as to the Lord and not to men.
Knowing that whatever good anyone does, this he will receive back from the Lord, whether he is a bondservant or free.
And masters, treat your servants in the same way, refraining from threats, knowing that both they and you have a Master in heaven, and there is no favoritism with Him.
Finally, my brothers, be strengthened in the Lord and in the power of His might.
Put on the full armor of God, so that you may be able to stand against the schemes of the devil.
For we do not wrestle against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the authorities, against the cosmic powers of this present darkness, against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly places.
Therefore, take up the whole armor of God, so that you may be able to withstand in the evil day, and having done all, to stand firm.
Stand therefore, having girded your waist with truth, and having put on the breastplate of righteousness.
And having fitted your feet with the readiness that comes from the gospel of peace,
In addition to all this, take up the shield of faith, with which you will be able to extinguish all the fiery darts of the wicked one.
And take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the Spirit, which is the Word of God.
Praying at all times in the Spirit, with all prayer and supplication. To that end, keep alert with all perseverance, making supplication for all the saints.
And pray for me, that whenever I open my mouth, words may be given to me so that I will fearlessly make known the mystery of the gospel.
for which I am an ambassador in chains, so that in it I may declare it boldly, as I ought to speak.
But so that you may also know about my circumstances and what I am doing, Tychicus, the beloved brother and faithful minister in the Lord, will make everything known to you.
I have sent him to you for this very purpose, so that you may know about our circumstances and that he may encourage your hearts.
Peace be with the brothers, and love with faith from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
Grace be with all who love our Lord Jesus Christ with an imperishable love. Amen.
Paul and Timothy, servants of Christ Jesus, to all the saints in Christ Jesus who are at Philippi, with the overseers and deacons.
Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
I thank my God for every remembrance of you.
In every prayer of mine, for all of you, I always pray with joy.
because of your partnership in the Gospel from the very first day until now.
I am confident of this very thing, that He who began a good work in you will carry it on to completion until the day of Jesus Christ.
It is right for me to think this way about all of you, because I have you in my heart; for whether I am in chains or defending and confirming the gospel, you all share in God’s grace with me.
For God is my witness, how I long for all of you with the tender affection of Christ Jesus.
And this is my prayer: that your love may abound more and more in knowledge and all discernment.
so that you may be able to discern what is best, and may be pure and blameless for the day of Christ.
filled with the fruits of righteousness that come through Jesus Christ, to the glory and praise of God.
I want you to know, brothers, that what has happened to me has really served to advance the gospel.
So that my chains have become known throughout the entire imperial guard and to all the others in Christ.
And most of the brothers, having confidence in the Lord because of my chains, are now more boldly proclaiming the word without fear.
Some indeed preach Christ out of envy and rivalry, but others out of goodwill.
The former preach Christ out of selfish ambition, not sincerely, thinking to afflict me in my imprisonment.
But the latter preach Christ out of love, knowing that I am put here for the defense of the gospel.
What then? Only that in every way, whether in pretense or in truth, Christ is proclaimed; and in this I rejoice, yes, and I will rejoice.
For I know that this will turn out for my deliverance through your prayers and the support of the Spirit of Jesus Christ.
According to my eager expectation and hope, I will not be ashamed in anything, but with all boldness, as always, Christ will be magnified in my body, whether by life or by death.
For to me, to live is Christ, and to die is gain.
But if living in the flesh means fruitful labor for me, then I do not know which I would choose.
But I am torn between the two; I long to depart and be with Christ, which is far better.
But to remain in the flesh is more necessary for your sake.
And being confident of this, I know that I will remain and continue with all of you for your progress and joy in the faith,
so that your boast may abound in Christ Jesus through my coming to you again.
Only let your lives be worthy of the gospel of Christ, so that whether I come and see you or am absent, I may hear of your affairs, that you stand firm in one spirit, striving together with one mind for the faith of the gospel.
And not being frightened in any way by those who oppose you; this is a clear sign to them of their destruction, but of your salvation, and that from God.
For to you it has been granted on behalf of Christ, not only to believe in Him but also to suffer for His sake.
Engaging in the same struggle, as you saw in me and now hear about in me.
Therefore, if there is any encouragement in Christ, any comfort from love, any participation in the Spirit, any affection and sympathy,
Complete my joy by being of the same mind, having the same love, being in full accord and of one mind.
Do nothing from selfish ambition or conceit, but in humility count others more significant than yourselves.
Let each of you not only look to your own interests, but also to the interests of others.
Let this mindset be in you which was also in Christ Jesus.
Who, existing in the very nature of God, did not consider equality with God something to be used for His own advantage.
but emptied Himself, taking on the form of a servant, being made in the likeness of men.
And being found in appearance as a man, he humbled himself by becoming obedient to the point of death, even death on a cross.
Therefore, God also exalted Him to the highest place and granted Him the name that is above every name.
That at the name of Jesus, every knee should bow, in heaven and on earth and under the earth.
And every tongue will confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.
Therefore, my beloved, as you have always obeyed, not only in my presence but now much more in my absence, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling.
For it is God who is at work within you, enabling both your desire and your ability to fulfill His good purpose.
Do everything without complaining or arguing.
so that you may become blameless and pure, children of God without fault in a crooked and depraved generation, in which you shine like stars in the universe.
Holding fast to the word of life, so that I may boast on the day of Christ that I did not run in vain or labor in vain.
But even if I am being poured out like a drink offering on the sacrifice and service of your faith, I rejoice and share my joy with all of you.
In the same way, you also should rejoice and celebrate with me.
But I hope in the Lord Jesus to send Timothy to you soon, so that I may also be cheered by news of you.
For I have no one else of equal soul who will genuinely care for your welfare.
For all seek their own interests, not those of Christ Jesus.
But you know his proven character, that as a son with a father, he has served with me in the work of the gospel.
Therefore, I hope to send him as soon as I see how things go with me.
And I have confidence in the Lord that I will come to you quickly.
But I thought it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus, my brother and fellow worker and companion in arms, and your messenger and minister to my needs.
For he has been longing for all of you and is distressed because he heard that you were sick.
Indeed, he was ill and close to death; but God had mercy on him, and not only on him, but also on me, to spare me sorrow upon sorrow.
Therefore, I am all the more eager to send him, so that when you see him again, you may rejoice, and I may be less anxious.
So receive him in the Lord with all joy, and honor such men.
For he came close to death for the work of Christ, risking his life to supply what was lacking in your service to me.
Finally, my brothers, rejoice in the Lord. To write the same things to you is no trouble to me, and it is a safeguard for you.
Beware of the dogs, beware of the evil workers, beware of the mutilation!
For we are the true circumcision, who worship God in the Spirit, rejoice in Christ Jesus, and place no confidence in the flesh.
Though I myself have reason for confidence in the flesh. If anyone thinks he has reason for confidence in the flesh, I have more:
Circumcised on the eighth day, of the nation of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, a Hebrew born of Hebrews; according to the law, a Pharisee.
As for zeal, I was a persecutor of the church; as for righteousness based on the law, I was faultless.
But whatever gains I had, these I now consider a loss because of Christ.
Indeed, I consider everything a loss because of the surpassing worth of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord. For his sake, I have suffered the loss of all things and count them as rubbish, that I may gain Christ.
and be found in Him, not having my own righteousness that comes from the law, but that which is through faith in Christ, the righteousness from God that depends on faith.
that I may know Him and the power of His resurrection, and may share in His sufferings, becoming like Him in His death,
if by any means I might attain to the resurrection of the dead.
Not that I have already obtained it, or have already reached perfection; but I press on to take hold of that for which Christ Jesus took hold of me.
Brothers, I do not consider myself to have fully grasped it yet; but one thing I do: forgetting what lies behind and straining forward to what lies ahead.
I press on toward the goal for the prize of the upward call of God in Christ Jesus, forgetting what lies behind and straining forward to what lies ahead.
Therefore, let those of us who are mature think this way; and if in anything you think otherwise, God will reveal that also to you.
Nevertheless, let us hold firm to the standard we have attained, and let us think with the same mind.
Brothers, be imitators of me, and observe those who walk according to the example you have in us.
For many walk, of whom I have often told you and now tell you even with tears, that they are enemies of the cross of Christ.
Their end is destruction; their god is their belly, and they glory in their shame, with minds set on earthly things.
For our citizenship is in heaven, from which we also eagerly await a Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ.
who will transform our humble body to be like His glorious body, by the power that enables Him even to subject all things to Himself.
Therefore, my beloved and longed-for brethren, my joy and crown, stand firm thus in the Lord, beloved.
I urge Euodia and I urge Syntyche to think the same way in the Lord.
Yes, I ask you also, true companion, help these women who have contended at my side in the cause of the gospel, along with Clement and the rest of my fellow workers, whose names are in the book of life.
Rejoice in the Lord always; again I will say, rejoice.
Let your gentle spirit be known to all men. The Lord is near.
Do not be anxious about anything, but in every situation, by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving, let your requests be made known to God.
And the peace of God, which surpasses all understanding, will guard your hearts and your thoughts in Christ Jesus.
Finally, brothers and sisters, whatever is true, whatever is noble, whatever is right, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is admirable—if anything is excellent or praiseworthy—think about such things.
Whatever you have learned and received and heard and seen in me—put these things into practice, and the God of peace will be with you.
I greatly rejoiced in the Lord that now at last you have revived your concern for me. Indeed, you were concerned, but you lacked the opportunity to show it.
Not that I speak out of need, for I have learned to be content in whatever situation I find myself.
I know how to be abased, and I know how to abound. In every circumstance, I have learned both to be full and to be hungry, to abound and to suffer need.
I am able to do all things through Christ who empowers me.
Nevertheless, you have done well to share in my affliction.
You also know, O Philippians, that in the very beginning of the gospel, when I left Macedonia, no church shared with me in the matter of giving and receiving except you alone.
For even in Thessalonica, you sent me help more than once for my needs.
Not that I seek the gift itself, but I seek the abundant fruit that increases to your account.
But I have received everything in full, and I abound. I am fully supplied, having received from Epaphroditus the gifts you sent, a fragrant aroma, an acceptable sacrifice, well-pleasing to God.
And my God will fully supply your every need according to His riches in glory in Christ Jesus.
To our God and Father be glory forever and ever. Amen.
Greet every saint in Christ Jesus. The brothers who are with me send their greetings to you.
All the saints send their greetings to you, especially those from the household of Caesar.
The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with all of you. Amen.
Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, and Timothy our brother,
To the saints and faithful brethren in Christ who are in Colossae: Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
We give thanks to God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, always praying for you.
Since we have heard of your faith in Christ Jesus and the love you have for all the saints,
because of the hope laid up for you in heaven, of which you have already heard in the word of truth, the gospel.
which has come to you, just as in all the world it is bearing fruit and growing, as it also does among you since the day you heard it and came to truly understand the grace of God.
just as you learned it from Epaphras, our beloved fellow servant, who is a faithful minister of Christ on your behalf,
who has also made clear to us your love in the Spirit.
For this reason, since the day we heard about you, we have not ceased to pray for you and to ask that you may be filled with the knowledge of His will in all spiritual wisdom and understanding.
so that you may walk in a manner worthy of the Lord, fully pleasing to Him, bearing fruit in every good work and increasing in the knowledge of God,
being strengthened with all power according to His glorious might, for all endurance and patience with joy.
Giving thanks to the Father who has made us adequate to share in the inheritance of the saints in light.
He has rescued us from the dominion of darkness and transferred us into the kingdom of the Son whom He loves.
In whom we possess redemption, the forgiveness of sins.
He is the exact representation of the invisible God, the preeminent one over all creation.
For by him all things were created, in the heavens and on the earth, visible and invisible, whether thrones, dominions, rulers, or authorities; all things were created through him and for him.
He is before all things, and in him all things hold together.
And He is the head of the body, the church; He is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead, so that in everything He might have the supremacy.
For it pleased the Father that all the fullness should dwell in Him.
and through Him to reconcile all things to Himself, having made peace through the blood of His cross; whether things on earth or things in heaven.
And you, who once were alienated and hostile in your minds because of your wicked deeds,
But now He has reconciled you by His physical body through death, to present you holy, blameless, and without fault before Him.
If indeed you continue in the faith, grounded and steadfast, and are not moved away from the hope of the gospel which you heard, which was proclaimed to every creature under heaven, of which I, Paul, became a minister.
Now I rejoice in my sufferings for your sake, and in my flesh I am completing what is lacking in Christ's afflictions for the sake of His body, which is the church.
Of this church, I became a servant according to the stewardship of God that was entrusted to me for you, to fulfill the word of God.
the mystery that has been hidden from ages and from generations, but now has been revealed to His saints.
To them God wished to make known what is the glorious wealth of this mystery among the Gentiles, which is Christ in you, the hope of glory.
Him we proclaim, warning every person and teaching every person with all wisdom, that we may present every person mature in Christ Jesus.
For this I toil, striving with all the energy that He powerfully works within me.
For I want you to know how great a struggle I have on your behalf, and for those in Laodicea, and for all who have not seen my face in the flesh.
that their hearts may be encouraged, being knit together in love, and attaining to all the riches of the full assurance of understanding, to the knowledge of the mystery of God, both of the Father and of Christ.
in whom are hidden all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge.
I say this so that no one may deceive you with persuasive arguments.
For although I am absent in body, yet I am with you in spirit, rejoicing to see your good order and the steadfastness of your faith in Christ.
Therefore, as you have received Christ Jesus the Lord, so walk in Him.
rooted and built up in Him, and established in the faith as you were taught, abounding in it with thanksgiving.
Beware that no one takes you captive through philosophy and empty deception, according to human tradition, according to the elemental spirits of the world, and not according to Christ.
For in Him dwells all the fullness of the Godhead bodily.
And you are complete in Him, who is the head of all principality and power.
In Him you were also circumcised with a circumcision made without hands, by putting off the body of the sins of the flesh, in the circumcision of Christ.
having been buried with Him in baptism, in which you also were raised with Him through faith in the working of God, who raised Him from the dead.
And you, being dead in your trespasses and in the uncircumcision of your flesh, He has made alive together with Him, forgiving us all our transgressions.
He has erased the record of our debts, the accusations that stood against us, and has taken it out of the way by nailing it to the cross.
Having disarmed the rulers and authorities, He made a public spectacle of them, triumphing over them by the cross.
Therefore, let no one judge you regarding what you eat or drink, or concerning a festival, a new moon, or sabbaths.
These are a shadow of the things that were to come; but the substance belongs to Christ.
Let no one disqualify you, insisting on asceticism and worship of angels, going on in detail about visions, puffed up without reason by his sensuous mind.
and not holding fast to the Head, from whom the whole body, nourished and knit together through its joints and ligaments, grows with a growth that is from God.
If you have died with Christ to the elemental spirits of the world, why, as if you were still alive in the world, do you submit to regulations?
"Do not touch, do not taste, do not handle"
These regulations are destined to perish with use, because they are based on human commands and teachings.
These have indeed an appearance of wisdom in self-made religion and humility, and severity to the body, but they are of no value in stopping the indulgence of the flesh.
If then you have been raised with Christ, seek the things that are above, where Christ is seated at the right hand of God.
Set your minds on things that are above, not on things that are on the earth.
For you have died, and your life is hidden with Christ in God.
When Christ, who is our life, appears, then you also will appear with Him in glory.
Therefore, put to death your members which are on the earth: sexual immorality, impurity, passion, evil desire, and covetousness, which is idolatry.
Because of these things, the wrath of God is coming upon the children of disobedience.
In these things you also once walked, when you were living in them.
But now you must also put away all these: anger, rage, malice, slander, and filthy language from your mouth.
Do not lie to one another, since you have taken off your old self with its practices.
and have put on the new self, which is being renewed in knowledge after the image of its Creator.
where there is neither Greek nor Jew, circumcised nor uncircumcised, barbarian, Scythian, slave nor free, but Christ is all, and is in all.
Therefore, as the chosen ones of God, holy and beloved, clothe yourselves with heartfelt compassion, kindness, humility, gentleness, and patience.
Bear with one another and forgive each other if anyone has a complaint against another; just as the Lord forgave you, so you must also forgive.
And above all these virtues, put on love, which is the tie that binds everything together in perfect harmony.
And let the peace of Christ rule in your hearts, to which you were indeed called in one body; and be thankful.
Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly, teaching and admonishing one another in all wisdom, singing psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, with thankfulness in your hearts to God.
And whatever you do, whether in word or deed, do it all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God the Father through Him.
Wives, submit yourselves to your husbands, as is fitting in the Lord.
Husbands, love your wives and do not be harsh with them.
Children, obey your parents in all things, for this is pleasing to the Lord.
Fathers, do not provoke your children, lest they become discouraged.
Servants, obey in all things your earthly masters, not only when they are watching, as those who seek to please men, but with sincerity of heart, fearing the Lord.
And whatever you do, do it heartily, as to the Lord and not to men.
Knowing that from the Lord you will receive the inheritance as your reward; for you serve the Lord Christ.
But the one who does wrong will be repaid for the wrong he has done, and there is no favoritism.
Masters, provide what is right and fair to your slaves, knowing that you also have a Master in heaven.
Devote yourselves to prayer, being watchful and thankful in it.
And pray for us as well, that God may open to us a door for the word, to declare the mystery of Christ, for which I am in chains.
That I may clearly declare it as I ought to speak.
Walk in wisdom toward those who are outside, making the most of your time.
Let your speech always be with grace, seasoned with salt, that you may know how you ought to answer each one.
All that concerns me will be made known to you by Tychicus, our beloved brother, faithful minister, and fellow servant in the Lord.
I am sending him to you for this very purpose, that he may inform you about your circumstances and encourage your hearts.
With Onesimus, the faithful and beloved brother, who is one of you. They will inform you about everything that is happening here.
Aristarchus, my fellow prisoner, greets you, and Mark, the cousin of Barnabas (concerning whom you have received instructions); if he comes to you, welcome him.
And Jesus who is called Justus, these are the only men of the circumcision among my fellow workers for the kingdom of God, and they have been a comfort to me.
Epaphras, who is one of you, greets you, a servant of Christ, always striving for you in his prayers, that you may stand perfect and complete in all the will of God.
For I testify to him that he has a great zeal for you and for those in Laodicea and those in Hierapolis.
Luke, the beloved physician, greets you, and so does Demas.
Greet the brothers in Laodicea, and Nymphas, and the church that meets in his house.
And when this letter has been read among you, see that it is also read in the church of the Laodiceans; and likewise, you should read the letter from Laodicea.
And say to Archippus: See that you fulfill the ministry that you received in the Lord.
This greeting is written with my own hand—Paul. Remember my chains. Grace be with you.
Paul, Silvanus, and Timothy, to the church of the Thessalonians in God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ: Grace to you and peace.
We give thanks to God always for all of you, making mention of you in our prayers.
We remember you constantly in our prayers before God, acknowledging your work produced by faith, your labor prompted by love, and your endurance inspired by the hope we have in our Lord Jesus Christ.
For we know, brothers and sisters loved by God, that you are chosen by Him.
For our gospel came to you not simply in word, but in power and in the Holy Spirit and with deep conviction. You know how we lived among you for your sake.
And you became imitators of us and of the Lord, having received the word in much affliction with joy from the Holy Spirit.
So that you became a model to all the believers in Macedonia and Achaia.
For from you sounded forth the word of the Lord, not only in Macedonia and Achaia, but your faith in God has gone forth everywhere, so that we need not say anything further.
For they themselves report concerning us the kind of reception we had among you, and how you turned to God from idols to serve the living and true God.
and to wait for His Son from heaven, whom He raised from the dead, Jesus, who delivers us from the wrath to come.
For you yourselves know, brothers, that our coming to you was not in vain,
But although we had suffered and been mistreated, as you know, in Philippi, we were bold in our God to declare to you the gospel of God in much conflict.
For our encouragement did not arise from error, nor from impurity, nor was it by deceit.
But just as we have been approved by God to be entrusted with the gospel, so we speak, not to please man, but to please God who tests our hearts.
For we never came with flattering speech, as you know, nor with a pretext for greed; God is our witness.
Nor did we seek glory from men, either from you or from others, even though we had authority as apostles of Christ.
But we were gentle among you, like a nursing mother caring for her own children.
So, being very fond of you, we were eager to share with you not only the gospel of God, but also our own lives, because you had become very dear to us.
For you remember, brothers, our labor and toil; we worked night and day so as not to burden any of you while we preached to you the gospel of God.
You are witnesses, and so is God, how holy and righteous and blameless was our conduct toward you who believe.
For you know how we treated each one of you, as a father treats his own children.
encouraging you and comforting you, and urging you to walk in a manner worthy of God, who calls you into His own kingdom and glory.
And for this reason, we also continually thank God, because when you received the word of hearing from us, you accepted it not as the word of men, but as it truly is, the word of God, which is also at work in you who believe.
For you, brothers, became imitators of the churches of God in Judea, in Christ Jesus, for you suffered the same things from your own countrymen as they did from the Jews.
who killed both the Lord Jesus and the prophets, and drove us out, and displeased God, and are hostile to all mankind.
They hinder us from speaking to the Gentiles, so that they may be saved, thus filling up their sins always. For the wrath has come upon them to the utmost.
But we, brothers, having been separated from you for a short time—in presence, not in heart—endeavored all the more eagerly to see your face with great longing.
Therefore, we wanted to come to you, I, Paul, more than once; but Satan hindered us.
For what is our hope, our joy, or our crown of rejoicing? Is it not even you, in the presence of our Lord Jesus Christ at His coming?
For you are our glory and joy.
Therefore, when we could bear it no longer, we chose to be left alone in Athens.
and we sent Timothy, our brother and God’s servant in the gospel of Christ, to strengthen and encourage you in your faith.
so that no one would be shaken by these afflictions. For you yourselves know that we are destined for this.
For indeed, when we were with you, we kept telling you that we would face trials, just as it has happened, and you know.
For this reason, when I could no longer bear it, I sent to know about your faith, fearing that the tempter might have tempted you and that our labor would be in vain.
But now that Timothy has come to us from you and has brought us good news of your faith and love, and that you always have a good remembrance of us, longing to see us, just as we also long to see you.
Therefore, brothers, in all our distress and affliction, we were comforted about you through your faith.
For now we live, if you stand firm in the Lord.
How can we thank God enough for you, in return for all the joy we feel before our God because of you?
As we pray night and day earnestly to see your face and supply what is lacking in your faith.
Now may our God and Father himself, and our Lord Jesus Christ, direct our way to you.
And may the Lord cause you to increase and overflow in love for one another and for all people, just as we do for you.
so that He may strengthen your hearts, making them blameless in holiness before our God and Father at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ with all His saints.
Finally then, brothers, we request and urge you in the Lord Jesus, just as you received from us how you ought to walk and please God, that you may abound even more.
For you know what instructions we gave you by the authority of the Lord Jesus.
For this is the will of God, your sanctification: that you abstain from sexual immorality.
that each one of you should know how to control your own body in holiness and honor,
not in the passion of lust like the Gentiles who do not know God.
that no one transgress and take advantage of his brother in this matter, because the Lord is the avenger of all such, as we also forewarned you and testified.
For God has not called us to impurity, but to holiness.
Therefore, the one who disregards this instruction does not reject a human authority, but God, who gives His Holy Spirit to you.
Now concerning brotherly love, you do not need me to write to you, for you yourselves have been taught by God to love one another.
And indeed, you are already showing love toward all the brothers throughout Macedonia. Yet we urge you, brothers, to increase this love even more.
And aspire to lead a quiet life, attending to your own business, and working with your own hands, as we instructed you.
so that you may walk properly toward those outside and be in need of nothing.
But we do not want you to be uninformed, brothers, about those who have fallen asleep, so that you may not grieve as others do who have no hope.
For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so, God will bring with him those who have fallen asleep through Jesus.
For this we declare to you by the word of the Lord, that we who are alive, who remain until the coming of the Lord, will not precede those who have fallen asleep.
For the Lord Himself will descend from heaven with a commanding shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trumpet of God; and the dead in Christ will rise first.
Then we who are alive, who remain, will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air; and thus we shall always be with the Lord.
Therefore, comfort one another with these words.
Now concerning the times and seasons, brothers, you have no need for anything to be written to you.
For you yourselves are well aware that the day of the Lord will come like a thief in the night.
When they say, ‘Peace and safety,’ then sudden destruction comes upon them, like labor pains upon a pregnant woman, and they shall not escape.
But you, brothers, are not in darkness, so that the day should surprise you like a thief.
For you all are children of light, children of the day. We do not belong to the night or to the darkness.
So then, let us not sleep as others do, but let us be awake and sober-minded.
For those who sleep, sleep at night, and those who get drunk, are drunk at night.
But since we belong to the day, let us be sober, putting on the breastplate of faith and love, and for a helmet, the hope of salvation.
For God has not destined us for wrath, but to obtain salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ.
who died for us, so that whether we are awake or asleep, we might live together with Him.
Therefore, encourage one another and build each other up, just as you are already doing.
But we ask you, brothers and sisters, to recognize those who labor among you and are in charge of you in the Lord and who admonish you.
and hold them in the highest regard and love because of their work. Live in peace with one another.
And we urge you, brothers and sisters, to admonish those who are idle, encourage the timid, help the weak, and be patient with everyone.
See that no one repays evil for evil, but always seek to do good to one another and to everyone.
Always rejoice.
Pray without ceasing.
In everything give thanks; for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus for you.
Do not extinguish the Spirit.
Do not despise prophetic utterances.
But test all things; hold fast to what is good.
Abstain from every form of evil.
Now may the God of peace Himself sanctify you completely, and may your whole spirit, soul, and body be preserved blameless at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.
Faithful is He who calls you, who also will accomplish it.
Brothers, pray for us.
Greet all the brothers with a holy embrace.
I solemnly charge you before the Lord to have this letter read to all the holy brothers.
The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you. Amen.
Paul, Silvanus, and Timothy, to the church of the Thessalonians in God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
Grace and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
We are obligated to give thanks to God always for you, brothers, as it is right, because your faith is growing abundantly and your love for one another is increasing.
So we ourselves boast about you among the churches of God for your steadfastness and faith in all your persecutions and the afflictions that you are enduring.
This is a clear indication of the righteous judgment of God, that you may be considered worthy of the kingdom of God for which you are also suffering.
For it is indeed right for God to repay those who afflict you with affliction.
And to you who are afflicted, He will grant relief along with us at the revelation of the Lord Jesus from heaven, with His mighty angels.
in flaming fire, inflicting vengeance on those who do not know God and on those who do not obey the Gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ.
They will suffer the penalty of eternal destruction, away from the presence of the Lord and from the glory of His might.
when He comes to be glorified among His saints and admired among all who have believed, because our testimony to you was believed on that day.
To this end, we always pray for you, that our God may make you worthy of His calling, and may fulfill every good pleasure of His goodness and every work of faith with power,
So that the name of our Lord Jesus Christ may be glorified in you, and you in Him, according to the grace of our God and the Lord Jesus Christ.
Now we beseech you, brothers, concerning the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ and our gathering together to Him,
that you not be quickly shaken in mind or troubled, either by spirit, or by word, or by letter, as if from us, as though the day of Christ had already come.
Let no one deceive you by any means; for that day will not come unless the apostasy comes first, and the man of sin is revealed, the son of perdition.
He opposes and exalts himself above all that is called God or that is worshiped, so that he sits as God in the temple of God, showing himself as if he were God.
Do you not remember that while I was still with you, I told you these things?
And now you know what is restraining him, so that he may be revealed in his own time.
For the mystery of lawlessness is already at work; only he who now holds it back will continue until he is taken out of the way.
And then the lawless one will be revealed, whom the Lord Jesus will destroy with the breath of His mouth and bring to nothing by the appearing of His coming.
The coming of the lawless one will be by the working of Satan, accompanied by all power and signs and false wonders.
and with every form of wicked deception for those who are perishing, because they refused to love the truth and so be saved.
Therefore, God will send them a strong delusion, so that they may believe what is false.
so that all may be condemned who did not believe the truth but took pleasure in unrighteousness.
But we ought always to thank God for you, brothers loved by the Lord, because God chose you as the firstfruits to be saved through the sanctifying work of the Spirit and through belief in the truth.
He called you to this through our gospel, so that you might share in the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ.
So then, brothers, stand firm and hold fast to the traditions that you were taught, whether by our spoken word or by our letter.
Now may our Lord Jesus Christ himself, and God our Father, who loved us and gave us eternal comfort and good hope through grace,
Comfort your hearts and strengthen you in every good word and deed.
Finally, brothers, pray for us, that the word of the Lord may spread rapidly and be honored, just as it was with you.
and that we may be delivered from unreasonable and wicked men; for not all have faith.
But the Lord is faithful; he will strengthen you and protect you from the evil one.
We have confidence in the Lord concerning you, that you are doing and will continue to do what we command.
But may the Lord direct your hearts into the love of God and into the patience of Christ.
Now we command you, brothers, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, to withdraw from every brother who walks in a disorderly manner and not according to the tradition which you received from us.
For you yourselves know how you ought to imitate us, because we were not disorderly among you.
We did not eat anyone’s bread without paying for it, but with toil and hard work, we labored night and day, so as not to burden any of you.
It is not that we lack the authority, but to give you an example to follow, so that you may imitate us.
For even when we were with you, we gave you this command: If anyone is not willing to work, let him not eat.
For we hear that there are some among you who walk in a disorderly manner, not working at all, but are busybodies.
Now we command and urge such ones, through our Lord Jesus Christ, to work quietly and eat their own bread.
But you, brothers, do not grow weary in doing good.
And if anyone does not obey our instruction through this letter, take note of that person and do not associate with him, so that he may be ashamed.
Yet do not regard him as an enemy, but warn him as a brother.
Now may the Lord of peace Himself grant you His peace at all times and in every way. The Lord be with you all.
The greeting is by my own hand, Paul, which is a sign in every letter; thus I write.
The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen.
Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the command of God our Savior and of Christ Jesus our hope.
To Timothy, my true child in the faith: Grace, mercy, and peace from God our Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.
As I urged you to remain in Ephesus when I was heading to Macedonia, so that you may command certain individuals not to teach any different doctrine.
nor to pay attention to myths and endless genealogies, which give rise to questions rather than the stewardship of God that is by faith.
But the goal of our instruction is love that comes from a pure heart, a good conscience, and sincere faith.
Some, having strayed from these things, have turned aside to meaningless discussions.
Desiring to be teachers of the law, but not understanding either what they say or the subjects they confidently affirm.
We know that the law is good if one uses it properly.
Realizing this, that the law is not laid down for the righteous, but for the lawless and insubordinate, for the ungodly and sinners, for the unholy and profane, for those who kill their fathers or mothers, for murderers,
for those who are sexually immoral, practicing homosexuality, enslavers, liars, perjurers, and whatever else is contrary to sound teaching.
in accordance with the glorious gospel of the blessed God, with which I have been entrusted.
I give thanks to Christ Jesus our Lord, who has strengthened me, because He considered me faithful, appointing me to His service.
I was formerly a blasphemer, a persecutor, and an arrogant man; but I received mercy because I acted in ignorance and unbelief.
And the grace of our Lord overflowed to me, along with faith and love that are in Christ Jesus.
This saying is trustworthy and deserving of full acceptance: Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners, of whom I am the foremost.
But for this very reason, I was shown mercy, so that in me, the worst of sinners, Christ Jesus might display his immense patience as an example for those who would believe in him and receive eternal life.
Now to the King eternal, immortal, invisible, the only wise God, be honor and glory for ever and ever. Amen.
This charge I entrust to you, son Timothy, in accordance with the prophecies previously made about you, that by them you may wage the good warfare.
holding on to faith and a good conscience. Some, by rejecting these, have shipwrecked their faith.
Among them are Hymenaeus and Alexander, whom I have handed over to Satan, so that they may learn not to blaspheme.
I urge you, then, first of all, to offer petitions, prayers, intercessions, and thanksgivings for all people.
for kings and all those in authority, that we may lead a tranquil and quiet life in all godliness and dignity.
For this is good and pleasing in the sight of our Savior God.
who desires all people to be saved and to come to the knowledge of the truth.
For there is one God, and there is one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus,
who gave Himself as a ransom for all, the testimony given at the proper time.
For this purpose I was appointed a preacher and an apostle; I speak the truth in Christ, I do not lie; I am a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and truth.
Therefore, I desire the men in every place to pray, lifting up holy hands without anger or disputing.
In the same way, I also want women to adorn themselves with proper attire, modestly and with self-control, not with elaborate hairstyles, gold, pearls, or expensive clothes.
but rather, they should show their devotion to God through good works.
Let a woman learn in quietness and full submission.
But I do not permit a woman to teach or to exercise authority over a man; rather, she is to remain quiet.
For Adam was formed first, then Eve.
And Adam was not deceived, but the woman, having been deceived, fell into transgression.
But she will be saved through childbearing, if they continue in faith, love, holiness, and self-control.
This is a trustworthy saying: If anyone aspires to the office of overseer, he desires a noble task.
Therefore, an overseer must be above reproach, the husband of one wife, sober-minded, self-controlled, respectable, hospitable, and able to teach.
He must not be a drunkard, nor violent, nor greedy for dishonest gain, but gentle, peaceable, not a lover of money.
He must manage his own household well, with children who respect and obey him in all dignity.
For if someone does not know how to manage his own household, how will he care for the church of God?
He must not be a recent convert, or he may become conceited and fall into the condemnation of the devil.
Moreover, he must have a good testimony from those outside the church, so that he will not fall into reproach and the snare of the devil.
Likewise, deacons must be dignified, not double-tongued, not indulging in much wine, not greedy for dishonest gain.
Holding to the mystery of the faith with a pure conscience.
And let them first be tested; then let them serve as deacons if they are found blameless.
In the same way, women must be dignified, not slanderers, sober-minded, faithful in all things.
Let deacons be the husbands of one wife, managing their children and their own households well.
For those who have served well as deacons acquire a good standing for themselves and great confidence in the faith that is in Christ Jesus.
These things I write to you, hoping to come to you soon.
If I delay, you may know how one ought to conduct themselves in the household of God, which is the church of the living God, a pillar and foundation of the truth.
And undeniably, great is the mystery of godliness: He was revealed in the flesh, justified in the Spirit, seen by angels, proclaimed among the nations, believed on in the world, taken up in glory.
Now the Spirit explicitly states that in the later times, some will renounce the faith and pay attention to deceitful spirits and the teachings of demons.
through the hypocrisy of liars whose consciences have been seared as with a hot iron.
They forbid marriage and advocate abstaining from certain foods, which God created to be received with thanksgiving by those who believe and know the truth.
For every creation of God is good, and nothing is to be rejected if it is received with thanksgiving.
For it is sanctified by the word of God and by prayer.
If you instruct the brothers in these things, you will be a good servant of Jesus Christ, nourished in the words of faith and of the good teaching that you have closely followed.
But reject irreverent and old wives' tales; rather, train yourself for godliness.
For physical training is of limited value, but godliness is beneficial in every way, holding promise for the present life and for the life to come.
This saying is trustworthy and deserves full acceptance.
For this reason, we strive and are insulted, because we have placed our hope in the living God, who is the Savior of all people, especially of those who believe.
Command and teach these things.
Let no one despise your youth, but be an example to the believers in word, in conduct, in love, in spirit, in faith, in purity.
Until I arrive, devote yourself to the public reading of Scripture, to exhortation, to teaching.
Do not neglect the spiritual gift that is in you, which was given to you through prophecy when the elders laid their hands on you.
Practice these things; be diligent in them, so that your progress may be evident to all.
Pay careful attention to yourself and to your teaching; persist in this, for by doing so you will save both yourself and those who hear you.
Do not harshly rebuke an older man, but appeal to him as you would to a father; treat younger men as brothers.
Treat older women as mothers, and younger women as sisters, with all purity.
Honor widows who are truly in need.
But if a widow has children or grandchildren, they must learn first to show piety at home and to repay their parents, for this is pleasing in the sight of God.
But she who is truly a widow, having set her hope on God, continues in prayers and supplications night and day.
But she who lives for pleasure is dead even while she lives.
And command these things so that they may be without blame.
But if anyone does not take care of his own, especially those of his household, he has denied the faith and is worse than an unbeliever.
Let no widow be enrolled unless she is not less than sixty years old, the wife of one husband.
having a reputation for good works: if she has brought up children, shown hospitality, washed the feet of the saints, assisted those in distress, and devoted herself to every good work.
But refuse to enroll younger widows; for when they become senseless in their desires for Christ, they wish to marry.
They incur judgment because they have rejected their former faith.
And besides, they learn to be idle, going about from house to house; and not only are they idle, but also gossips and busybodies, saying things which they ought not.
Therefore, I desire that the younger widows marry, bear children, and manage their households, giving no opportunity to the adversary for slander.
For some have already turned aside to follow Satan.
If any believing woman has relatives who are widows, let her assist them, and do not let the church be burdened, so that it may assist those widows who are truly in need.
Let the elders who lead well be considered worthy of double honor, especially those who labor in preaching and teaching.
For the Scripture says, 'You shall not muzzle an ox while it is treading out the grain,' and, 'The laborer is worthy of his wages.'
Do not accept an accusation against an elder unless it is confirmed by two or three witnesses.
Rebuke those who persist in sin before everyone, so that the rest may take warning.
I solemnly charge you before God and Christ Jesus and the chosen angels, to keep these instructions without bias, doing nothing out of favoritism.
Do not hastily lay hands on anyone, nor partake in the sins of others; keep yourself pure.
Do not continue drinking only water, but use a little wine for the sake of your stomach and your frequent ailments.
The sins of some people are clearly evident, leading them to judgment; while others follow after.
Likewise, good works are clearly evident, and those that are not cannot remain hidden.
Let all who are under the yoke as servants regard their own masters as worthy of all honor, so that the name of God and the teaching may not be reviled.
But those who have believing masters should not be disrespectful because they are brothers; rather, they should serve all the more, since those who benefit by their good service are believers and beloved.
Teach and encourage these things. If anyone advocates a different doctrine and does not agree with the sound words of our Lord Jesus Christ and the teaching that accords with godliness,
He is conceited, understanding nothing, but he has a morbid craving for controversy and disputes about words, from which arise envy, strife, slander, evil suspicions,
and constant friction among people who are depraved in mind and deprived of the truth, imagining that godliness is a means of gain. Withdraw yourself from such.
But godliness with contentment is great gain.
For we brought nothing into the world, and it is clear that we cannot take anything out of it.
But if we have food and clothing, with these we will be content.
But those who desire to be rich fall into temptation and a snare, and into many foolish and harmful desires that plunge men into ruin and destruction.
For the love of money is a root of all kinds of evil, from which some, aspiring to it, have wandered away from the faith and pierced themselves through with many sorrows.
But you, O man of God, flee these things; and pursue righteousness, godliness, faith, love, endurance, and gentleness.
Strive for the good fight of faith; seize the eternal life to which you were called and for which you made the good confession in the presence of many witnesses.
I charge you in the sight of God, who gives life to all things, and of Christ Jesus, who made the good confession before Pontius Pilate.
to keep the commandment unstained and without reproach until the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ,
which He will display at the proper time, He who is the blessed and only Sovereign, the King of kings and Lord of lords.
He alone possesses immortality, dwelling in unapproachable light, whom no man has seen or can see. To Him be honor and eternal dominion. Amen.
Instruct those who are wealthy in this present age not to be proud or to set their hope on the uncertainty of riches, but on God, who richly provides us with all things to enjoy.
Instruct them to do good, to be rich in good works, to be generous and ready to share.
Storing up for themselves a good foundation for the future, so that they may take hold of the eternal life.
O Timothy, guard the deposit entrusted to you, avoiding the irreverent babble and contradictions of what is falsely called knowledge.
which some have professed and thereby wandered away from the faith. Grace be with you. Amen.
Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God, according to the promise of life that is in Christ Jesus.
To Timothy, my beloved son: Grace, mercy, and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.
I thank God, whom I serve with a clear conscience as my ancestors did, as I remember you constantly in my prayers night and day.
Longing to see you, remembering your tears, so that I may be filled with joy.
I am reminded of your sincere faith, which first dwelt in your grandmother Lois and your mother Eunice, and I am convinced is also in you.
Therefore, I remind you to rekindle the gift of God that is within you through the laying on of my hands.
For God did not give us a spirit of fear, but of power, love, and self-discipline.
Therefore, do not be ashamed of the testimony of our Lord, nor of me His prisoner; but share in the suffering for the gospel according to the power of God.
Who has saved us and called us with a holy calling, not according to our works, but according to His own purpose and grace, which was given to us in Christ Jesus before the ages began.
but has now been made manifest through the appearing of our Savior, Jesus Christ, who has abolished death and brought life and immortality to light through the gospel.
For this purpose I was appointed as a herald, an apostle, and a teacher of the nations.
Because of this, I also suffer these things; yet I am not ashamed, for I know whom I have believed, and I am convinced that He is able to guard what I have entrusted to Him until that day.
Hold fast to the pattern of sound words which you have heard from me, in faith and love that are in Christ Jesus.
Guard the good deposit entrusted to you, through the Holy Spirit who dwells within us.
You know this, that all those in Asia have turned away from me, of whom are Phygelus and Hermogenes.
May the Lord grant mercy to the household of Onesiphorus, for he often refreshed me and was not ashamed of my chains.
but when he arrived in Rome, he eagerly searched for me and found me.
May the Lord grant him to find mercy from the Lord on that day. You know very well how much he served in Ephesus.
You then, my child, be strengthened by the grace that is in Christ Jesus.
And what you have heard from me in the presence of many witnesses, entrust to faithful men who will be able to teach others also.
Therefore, endure hardship as a good soldier of Jesus Christ.
No soldier gets entangled in civilian pursuits, since his aim is to please the one who enlisted him.
And if anyone competes as an athlete, he is not crowned unless he competes according to the rules.
The hardworking farmer ought to be the first to partake of the fruits.
Reflect on what I am saying, for the Lord will grant you understanding in everything.
Remember Jesus Christ, risen from the dead, descended from David, according to my gospel.
For which I suffer hardship even to the point of being chained like a criminal; but the word of God cannot be chained.
Therefore, I endure all things for the sake of the elect, so that they too may obtain the salvation that is in Christ Jesus, along with eternal glory.
This is a trustworthy saying: if we have died with him, we will also live with him.
If we endure, we will also reign with Him; if we deny Him, He will also deny us.
If we are faithless, He remains faithful; He cannot deny Himself.
Remind them of these things, testifying before the Lord not to engage in quarrels that are of no benefit, leading only to the ruin of those who hear.
Do your utmost to present yourself approved to God, a worker who does not need to be ashamed, accurately handling the word of truth.
But avoid profane and empty chatter, for they will only lead to further ungodliness.
And their word will spread like gangrene; among them are Hymenaeus and Philetus.
They have deviated from the truth, claiming that the resurrection has already occurred, and they are undermining the faith of some.
However, the solid foundation of God stands firm, having this seal: "The Lord knows those who are His," and, "Let everyone who names the name of the Lord depart from iniquity."
But in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and silver, but also of wood and clay; some are for honor, and some for dishonor.
Therefore, if anyone cleanses himself from these, he will be a vessel for honor, sanctified and useful to the Master, prepared for every good work.
So flee youthful passions, and pursue righteousness, faith, love, and peace, along with those who call on the Lord out of a pure heart.
But refuse foolish and ignorant disputes, knowing that they breed quarrels.
And the servant of the Lord must not be quarrelsome, but kind to everyone, able to teach, patiently enduring wrong.
correcting his opponents with gentleness; perhaps God may grant them repentance leading to a knowledge of the truth.
and they may come to their senses and escape from the snare of the devil, after being captured by him to do his will.
But know this: in the last days, perilous times will come.
For men will be lovers of themselves, lovers of money, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy.
Without natural affection, untrustworthy, slanderous, without self-control, brutal, not lovers of good.
traitors, reckless, conceited, lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God,
They will have the appearance of godliness, but deny its power. Avoid such people.
For among them are those who creep into households and captivate weak women, burdened with sins and led by various desires.
Always seeking knowledge, but never able to arrive at the full understanding of the truth.
Just as Janes and Jambres opposed Moses, so also these men oppose the truth; they are men of depraved minds, unfit for faith.
But they will not advance any further; for their folly will be evident to all, just as the folly of those men became.
But you have followed closely my teaching, my conduct, my purpose, my faith, my patience, my love, and my endurance.
My persecutions and sufferings, such as those I endured in Antioch, Iconium, and Lystra; what persecutions I faced! Yet the Lord delivered me from them all.
Indeed, all who wish to lead a life of godliness in Christ Jesus will be persecuted.
But wicked men and deceivers will progress from bad to worse, deceiving and being deceived.
But you must continue in the things you have learned and have been assured of, knowing from whom you learned them.
and that from childhood you have known the sacred Scriptures, which are able to make you wise for salvation through faith in Christ Jesus.
All Scripture is breathed out by God and is useful for teaching, for reproof, for correction, and for training in righteousness.
so that the man of God may be complete, equipped for every good work.
I solemnly charge you in the presence of God and of Christ Jesus, who is to judge the living and the dead, and by His appearing and His kingdom.
Preach the Word; be ready in season and out of season; reprove, rebuke, and encourage, with all patience and teaching.
For the time will come when they will not endure sound teaching, but having itching ears, they will accumulate for themselves teachers to suit their own desires.
And they will turn away from listening to the truth and wander off into myths.
But you, be sober in all things, endure hardship, do the work of an evangelist, fulfill your ministry.
For I am already being poured out as a drink offering, and the time for my departure is at hand.
I have fought the good fight, I have finished the race, I have kept the faith.
Now there is laid up for me the crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous Judge, will give to me on that day; and not to me only, but also to all who have loved His appearing.
Make every effort to come to me quickly;.
For Demas has forsaken me, having loved this present age, and has departed for Thessalonica; Crescens has gone to Galatia, Titus to Dalmatia.
Only Luke is with me. Get Mark and bring him with you, for he is useful to me in ministry.
But I have sent Tychicus to Ephesus.
When you come, bring the cloak that I left with Carpus at Troas, and the scrolls, especially the parchments.
Alexander the coppersmith did me great harm; the Lord will repay him according to his deeds.
Be on guard against him; for he has greatly opposed our words.
At my first defense, no one stood by me, but everyone deserted me. May it not be held against them.
But the Lord stood by me and strengthened me, so that through me the message might be fully proclaimed and all the Gentiles might hear it. And I was rescued from the lion's mouth.
And the Lord will rescue me from every evil deed and bring me safely into His heavenly kingdom; to Him be glory forever and ever. Amen.
Greet Priscilla and Aquila, and the household of Onesiphorus.
Erastus stayed in Corinth, and I left Trophimus sick in Miletus.
Make every effort to come before winter. Eubulus, Pudens, Linus, and Claudia send their greetings, along with all the brothers.
The Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. May grace be with you.
Paul, a servant of God and an apostle of Jesus Christ, for the faith of God’s chosen ones and the knowledge of the truth that leads to godliness.
in hope of eternal life, which God, who cannot lie, promised before the ages began.
But at the proper times He revealed His word through preaching, which I was entrusted with by the command of our Savior, God.
To Titus, my true child in our common faith: Grace, mercy, and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Savior.
For this reason, I left you in Crete, so that you might put what remains in order and appoint elders in every town, as I directed you.
If anyone is blameless, the husband of one wife, having faithful children not accused of rebellion or disorder.
For an overseer must be blameless, as a steward of God; not self-willed, not quick-tempered, not given to wine, not violent, not greedy for dishonest gain.
But he must be hospitable, a lover of good, self-controlled, just, holy, and disciplined.
He must hold firmly to the trustworthy message as it has been taught, so that he can encourage others by sound doctrine and refute those who oppose it.
For there are many rebellious individuals, full of empty talk and deception, especially those of the circumcision.
They must be silenced, for they are upsetting entire households by teaching things they ought not to teach for the sake of dishonest gain.
One of them, a prophet from their own, has said, 'Cretans are always liars, evil beasts, lazy gluttons.'
This testimony is true. Therefore, rebuke them sharply, so that they may be sound in the faith.
not paying attention to Jewish myths and the commands of men who turn away from the truth.
To the pure, all things are pure, but to those who are corrupted and unbelieving, nothing is pure; both their minds and consciences are defiled.
They profess to know God, but by their deeds they deny Him, being detestable, disobedient, and worthless for every good work.
But as for you, speak the things which are fitting for sound doctrine.
Older men are to be temperate, dignified, self-controlled, sound in faith, in love, and in steadfastness.
Likewise, older women are to be reverent in behavior, not slanderers or slaves to much wine, but teachers of good things.
that they may teach the young women to be sensible, to love their husbands, and to love their children.
to be discreet, pure, keepers at home, kind, and submissive to their own husbands, so that the word of God may not be blasphemed.
In the same way, encourage the young men to be self-controlled.
In all things, show yourself to be a model of good works; in your teaching, exhibit integrity, dignity, and incorruptibility.
and sound speech that cannot be condemned, so that those who oppose you may be ashamed, having nothing evil to say about us.
Slaves are to be submissive to their own masters in everything, aiming to be pleasing and not argumentative.
not pilfering, but showing all good faith, so that in everything they may adorn the doctrine of our Savior, God.
For the grace of God that brings salvation has appeared to all men.
Instructing us to deny ungodliness and worldly desires, and to live soberly, righteously, and godly in the present age.
awaiting our blessed hope, the glorious appearing of our great God and Savior, Jesus Christ.
Who gave Himself for us, to redeem us from all lawlessness and to purify for Himself a people who are His very own, eager to do good works.
Declare these things; exhort and rebuke with all authority. Let no one disregard you.
Remind them to be submissive to rulers and authorities, to be obedient, and to be ready for every good work.
to speak evil of no one, to be peaceable, gentle, showing all humility toward all men.
For we ourselves were once foolish, disobedient, led astray, slaves to various passions and pleasures, passing our days in malice and envy, hated by others and hating one another.
But when the goodness and loving kindness of our God and Savior appeared,
He saved us, not because of any righteous deeds we had done, but according to His own mercy, through the washing of regeneration and renewing of the Holy Spirit.
He generously poured out His Spirit on us through Jesus Christ our Savior.
So that being justified by His grace, we might become heirs according to the hope of eternal life.
This is a faithful saying, and I want you to affirm strongly regarding these matters, so that those who have believed in God may be careful to engage in good works. These things are good and profitable for all people.
But avoid foolish disputes, genealogies, arguments, and quarrels about the Law; for they are unprofitable and worthless.
Reject a divisive person after the first and second admonition.
knowing that such a person is warped and sinful; they are self-condemned.
When I send Artemas or Tychicus to you, make every effort to come to me in Nicopolis, for I have decided to spend the winter there.
Send Zenas the lawyer and Apollos on their way diligently, so that nothing may be lacking for them.
And let our people learn to engage in good deeds to meet urgent needs, so that they will not be unfruitful.
All who are with me send you greetings. Greet those who love us in faith. Grace be with all of you.
Paul, a prisoner of Christ Jesus, and Timothy our brother, to Philemon our beloved and fellow worker.
and to Apphia our beloved and to Archippus our fellow soldier, and to the church that meets in your home.
Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
I always thank my God as I remember you in my prayers, continuously.
hearing of your love and faith that you have toward the Lord Jesus and toward all the saints,
that the fellowship of your faith may become effective through the knowledge of every good thing which is in us for Christ Jesus.
For we have great joy and comfort in your love, because the hearts of the saints have been refreshed through you, brother.
Therefore, although I have great boldness in Christ to command you what is fitting,
Yet, I appeal to you instead on the basis of love, being such a one as Paul, an elder and now also a prisoner of Christ Jesus.
I appeal to you for my child, whom I have begotten in my chains, Onesimus,
Formerly he was useless to you, but now he has become useful both to you and to me, whom I am sending back to you.
I am sending him back to you, this is my own heart.
Whom I wanted to keep with me, that he might minister to me on your behalf in my chains for the gospel.
But without your consent, I did not want to do anything, so that your good deed would not be forced, but voluntary.
For perhaps it was for this reason that he was separated from you for a while, so that you might receive him back forever.
no longer as a slave, but better than a slave, a beloved brother—especially to me, but how much more to you, both in the flesh and in the Lord!
If you consider me a partner, welcome him as you would welcome me.
If he has wronged you in any way or owes you anything, charge it to my account.
I, Paul, write this with my own hand: I will repay it. To say nothing of your owing me even your own self.
Yes, brother, I desire to have joy from you in the Lord; refresh my heart in Christ.
Having confidence in your obedience, I have written to you, knowing that you will do even more than I ask.
At the same time, prepare a guest room for me, because I hope to be restored to you in answer to your prayers.
Epaphras, my fellow prisoner in Christ Jesus, sends greetings to you.
Mark, Aristarchus, Demas, and Luke, my fellow workers.
The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Amen.
Long ago, God spoke many times and in various ways to our ancestors through the prophets, but in these last days, He has spoken to us by His Son.
But in these last days, He has appointed His Son as heir of all things, through whom He also made the ages.
He is the radiance of His glory and the exact representation of His essence, sustaining all things by His powerful word. After making purification for our sins, He sat down at the right hand of the Majesty on high.
Having become as much superior to the angels as the name he has inherited is more excellent than theirs.
For to which of the angels did God ever say, 'You are my Son; today I have begotten you'? And again, 'I will be a Father to him, and he shall be a Son to me'?
But when He again brings the Firstborn into the world, He says, 'Let all the angels of God worship Him.'
Of the angels He says, 'He makes His angels spirits, and His ministers a flame of fire.'
But of the Son, He says, 'Your throne, O God, is forever and ever; the scepter of righteousness is the scepter of your kingdom.'
You have loved righteousness and hated lawlessness; therefore God, your God, has anointed you with the oil of gladness beyond your companions.
And, "You, Lord, in the beginning laid the foundation of the earth, and the heavens are the works of your hands;"
They will perish, but you remain; and all of them will become old like a garment.
Like a cloak, you will fold them up, and they will be changed. But you are the same, and your years will never come to an end.
But to which of the angels has He ever said, 'Sit at My right hand until I make your enemies a footstool for your feet?'
Are not all angels ministering spirits sent to serve those who will inherit salvation?
For this reason, we must pay even closer attention to what we have heard, lest we drift away from it.
For if the message spoken through angels was proven steadfast, and every disobedience and disregard received its just penalty,
How shall we escape if we neglect so great a salvation? This salvation, which was first declared by the Lord, was confirmed to us by those who heard it.
God also bore witness to it by signs and wonders and various miracles, and by gifts of the Holy Spirit distributed according to His will.
For it was not to angels that the coming world was subjected, about which we are speaking.
But someone has testified somewhere, "What is man that You are mindful of him, or the son of man that You take care of him?"
You made him for a short time lower than the angels; You crowned him with glory and honor.
You have put everything under his authority; in subduing all things to him, nothing was left unsubjected. Yet at this time, we do not see everything fully subjected to him.
But we see Jesus, who was made a little lower than the angels for a time, crowned with glory and honor because of his suffering and death, so that by the grace of God he might taste death for everyone.
For it was fitting for Him, through whom all things exist and by whom all things are made, to bring many sons to glory, by making the author of their salvation perfect through sufferings.
For both the One who sanctifies and those who are sanctified are all from one source; therefore, He is not ashamed to call them His brothers.
saying, 'I will proclaim your name to my brothers; in the midst of the assembly, I will sing your praise.'
And again, I will put my trust in Him; and again, here am I, along with the children God has given me.
Since therefore the children share in flesh and blood, he himself likewise shared in the same things, that through death he might destroy the one who has the power of death, that is, the devil,
and free those who all their lives were held in bondage by the fear of death.
For surely it is not angels that he helps, but he helps the offspring of Abraham.
Therefore, he had to be made like his brothers in every respect, so that he might become a merciful and faithful high priest in service to God, to make propitiation for the sins of the people.
For because he himself has suffered when tempted, he is able to help those who are being tempted.
Therefore, holy brothers, partners in a heavenly calling, consider Jesus, the Apostle and High Priest of our confession.
He was faithful to the one who appointed him, just as Moses was faithful in all of God's house.
For Jesus has been deemed worthy of greater glory than Moses, just as the builder of a house has more honor than the house itself.
For every house is built by someone, but the one who built everything is God.
And Moses indeed was faithful in all his house as a servant, for a testimony of those things which were to be spoken later.
But Christ as a Son over His own house, whose house we are if we hold fast the boldness and the rejoicing of the hope firm to the end.
Therefore, as the Holy Spirit says: 'Today, if you hear His voice,'
Do not harden your hearts as in the rebellion, on the day of testing in the wilderness.
where your fathers tested me and tried me, and saw my works for forty years.
Therefore I was provoked by that generation, and said: 'They always go astray in their hearts, and they have not recognized my ways;'
So I swore in my anger, ‘They shall never enter into my rest.’
See to it, brothers, that none of you has a heart of unbelief that turns away from the living God.
But encourage one another daily, as long as it is called 'today,' so that none of you may be hardened by sin’s deceitfulness.
For we have become partakers of Christ, if we hold firmly to the beginning of our assurance until the end.
As it is said: "Today, if you hear his voice, do not harden your hearts as they did in the rebellion."
For who were they who heard and yet rebelled? Was it not all those who came out of Egypt through Moses?
And with whom was He angry for forty years? Was it not with those who sinned, whose bodies fell in the wilderness?
And to whom did He swear that they would not enter His rest, except to those who were disobedient?
And we see that they were unable to enter because of their lack of faith.
Therefore, let us fear, lest any of you should seem to have come short of entering into His rest.
For indeed we have been given good news, just as they were; but the message they heard did not benefit them, because it was not mixed with faith in those who listened.
For we who have believed enter that rest, as He has said, ‘As I swore in my wrath, they shall not enter my rest,’ although His works were finished from the foundation of the world.
For He has somewhere spoken of the seventh day in this way: 'And God rested on the seventh day from all His works.'
And again, He says, 'They shall not enter into My rest.'
Since then, it remains for some to enter into that rest, and those who were formerly given the good news did not enter because of their disobedience.
Again he appoints a certain day, ‘Today,’ saying through David, after so long a time, as it has been said: ‘Today, if you hear his voice, do not harden your hearts.'
For if Jesus had given them rest, he would not have spoken later of another day.
So then, a Sabbath rest remains for the people of God.
For the one who has entered His rest has also ceased from his own works, just as God did from His.
Let us therefore be diligent to enter that rest, so that no one will fall by following the same example of disobedience.
For the word of God is alive and active, sharper than any double-edged sword, penetrating to the division of soul and spirit, joints and marrow, and discerning the thoughts and intentions of the heart.
And no creature is hidden from His sight, but all things are naked and exposed to the eyes of Him to whom we must give account.
Therefore, since we have a great high priest who has ascended into heaven, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold firmly to the faith we profess.
For we do not have a high priest who is unable to empathize with our weaknesses, but one who has been tested in every way, just as we are—yet he did not sin.
Let us then approach the throne of grace with boldness, that we may receive mercy and find grace to help in our time of need.
For every high priest, chosen from among men, is appointed on behalf of men in matters relating to God, to offer gifts and sacrifices for sins.
He can deal gently with those who are ignorant and going astray, since he himself is beset by weakness.
And for this reason, he is obligated, just as for the people, so also for himself to offer sacrifices for sins.
And no one takes this honor upon himself, but only when called by God, just as Aaron was.
In the same way, Christ did not glorify Himself to become a high priest, but it was He who said to Him, 'You are my Son; today I have begotten You.'
As also He says in another place, 'You are a priest forever according to the order of Melchizedek.'
Who in the days of His flesh offered up prayers and supplications with vehement cries and tears to Him who was able to save Him from death, and was heard because of His godly fear.
Though He was a Son, He learned obedience through the things which He suffered.
And having been perfected, He became the source of eternal salvation for all who obey Him.
Designated by God as a high priest according to the order of Melchizedek.
Concerning this, we have much to say, but it is hard to explain, since you have become sluggish in your hearing.
For though by this time you ought to be teachers, you again need someone to teach you the basic principles of God’s words. You have come to need milk, not solid food.
For everyone who partakes of milk is unskilled in the word of righteousness, for he is a child.
But solid food belongs to those who are of full age, those who by reason of use have their senses exercised to discern both good and evil.
Therefore, let us leave behind the elementary teachings about Christ and press on to maturity, not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works and of faith toward God.
of the teachings about baptisms, the laying on of hands, the resurrection of the dead, and eternal judgment.
And this we will do, if God permits.
For it is impossible for those who were once enlightened, who have tasted the heavenly gift, and who have become partakers of the Holy Spirit.
and have tasted the goodness of the word of God and the powers of the coming age.
and if they fall away, it is impossible to renew them again to repentance, since they are crucifying the Son of God all over again and exposing him to public disgrace.
For land that drinks in the rain falling on it repeatedly and produces a crop useful to those for whom it is cultivated receives the blessing of God.
But if it produces thorns and thistles, it is worthless and near to being cursed, and its end is to be burned.
But beloved, we are convinced of better things concerning you, things that accompany salvation, even though we speak in this way.
For God is not unjust to forget your work and the love you have shown toward His name, in that you have ministered to the saints and continue to do so.
But we earnestly desire that each of you show the same steadfast effort to the full assurance of hope until the end.
so that you may not become sluggish, but imitators of those who through faith and patience inherit the promises.
For when God made a promise to Abraham, since He could swear by no one greater, He swore by Himself.
saying, 'Surely I will bless you and multiply you.'
And thus, having patiently endured, he obtained the promise.
For men indeed swear by a greater authority, and an oath serves as a confirmation to end all dispute.
Thus, in His desire to demonstrate more clearly to the heirs of the promise the unchangeable nature of His will, God intervened with an oath.
so that by two unchangeable things, in which it is impossible for God to lie, we might have strong encouragement, we who have fled for refuge to lay hold of the hope set before us.
This hope we have as an anchor for the soul, both secure and steadfast, and which enters the inner sanctuary behind the curtain.
Where Jesus has entered as a forerunner on our behalf, having become a high priest forever according to the order of Melchizedek.
For this Melchizedek, king of Salem, priest of God Most High, met Abraham returning from the defeat of the kings and blessed him.
To whom also Abraham gave a tenth part of all; first being translated, 'king of righteousness,' and then also king of Salem, which is 'king of peace.'
Without father, without mother, without genealogy, having neither beginning of days nor end of life, but made like the Son of God, remains a priest forever.
Consider how great this man was, to whom even the patriarch Abraham gave a tenth of the best spoils.
And those who are of the sons of Levi, who receive the priesthood, are commanded to collect a tithe from the people according to the law, that is, from their fellow countrymen, even though they have descended from the loins of Abraham.
But this man, who does not have a genealogy among them, has collected a tithe from Abraham and blessed the one who has the promises.
Without any dispute, the lesser is blessed by the greater.
Here, mortal men receive tithes, but there, it is testified that He lives.
And to put it another way, through Abraham, even Levi, who receives tithes, was, in a manner of speaking, tithed.
For he was still in the loins of his father when Melchizedek met him.
Now if perfection was attainable through the Levitical priesthood (for under it the people received the law), what further need was there for another priest to arise, one after the order of Melchizedek, rather than one named after the order of Aaron?
For when there is a change in the priesthood, there is necessarily a change in the law as well.
For the one about whom these things are said belonged to another tribe, from which no one has ever served at the altar.
For it is evident that our Lord arose from Judah, a tribe concerning which Moses spoke nothing about priesthood.
And it is even more evident when another priest arises in the likeness of Melchizedek.
who has become a priest not through a commandment of physical descent, but by the power of an indestructible life.
For it testifies that you are a priest forever according to the order of Melchizedek.
For on one hand, a former commandment is set aside because of its weakness and ineffectiveness.
For the law made nothing perfect; but a better hope is introduced, through which we draw near to God.
And inasmuch as He was not made priest without an oath; for those priests were made without an oath, but He was made priest with an oath.
but He with an oath by the one who said to Him: ‘The Lord has sworn and will not change His mind; You are a priest forever according to the order of Melchizedek.’
By so much more, Jesus has become the surety of a better covenant.
And indeed, many had become priests, because they were prevented by death from continuing in office;.
But He, because He remains forever, has an untransferable priesthood.
Therefore, He is able to save completely those who approach God through Him, since He always lives to intercede for them.
Such a High Priest truly meets our needs: holy, innocent, unstained, separated from sinners, and exalted above the heavens.
He does not need to offer sacrifices every day, as the high priests do, first for their own sins and then for the sins of the people; he sacrificed for their sins once for all when he offered up himself.
For the Law appoints men as high priests who are weak, but the word of the oath, which came after the Law, appoints a Son who has been made perfect forever.
Now, the main point of what we are saying is this: We have such a high priest, who has taken his seat at the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens.
He serves in the role of a high priest in the true sanctuary, which the Lord set up, and not man.
For every high priest is appointed to offer gifts and sacrifices; therefore, it is necessary that this one also have something to offer.
Now if He were on earth, He would not be a priest at all, since there are priests who offer gifts according to the Law.
They serve a copy and shadow of the heavenly things, as Moses was warned when he was about to erect the tabernacle. For He said, 'See that you make all things according to the pattern shown you on the mountain.'
But now He has obtained a more excellent ministry, inasmuch as He is also Mediator of a better covenant, which was established on better promises.
For if that first covenant had been faultless, then no place would have been sought for a second.
For God finds fault with them when He says: ‘Behold, the days are coming,’ says the Lord, ‘when I will establish a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah.
Not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers on the day when I took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt; for they did not remain faithful to my covenant, and I disregarded them, says the Lord.
For this is the covenant that I will establish with the house of Israel after those days, says the Lord: I will place my laws into their minds, and I will write them on their hearts; and I will be their God, and they shall be my people.
And no one will teach his neighbor, nor will anyone teach his brother, saying, 'Know the Lord,' for all will know me, from the least to the greatest of them.
For I will be merciful toward their wrongdoings, and their sins and lawless deeds I will remember no more.
In saying 'a new covenant,' He has made the first obsolete; and what is becoming obsolete and growing old is ready to vanish away.
Now, indeed, the first tabernacle had regulations for worship and an earthly sanctuary.
For a tabernacle was constructed, the first, in which were the lampstand, the table, and the arrangement of the bread of the Presence, which is called the Holy Place.
But behind the second veil stood the tabernacle known as the Holy of Holies.
having a golden censer and the Ark of the Covenant covered on all sides with gold, in which was a golden pot holding the manna, and Aaron's rod that budded, and the tablets of the covenant.
And above it were the cherubim of glory, overshadowing the mercy seat; about which we cannot now speak in detail.
Now, when these things had been prepared this way, the priests regularly enter the first tent to carry out their sacred duties.
But into the second part, the high priest enters alone once a year, not without blood, which he offers for himself and for the ignorant sins of the people.
The Holy Spirit was making this clear: that the way into the holiest place was not yet revealed as long as the first tabernacle was still standing.
This is an illustration for the present time, showing that the gifts and sacrifices being offered cannot perfect the worshiper in regard to conscience.
They pertain only to food and drink, various ritual washings, and fleshly ordinances, imposed until the time of reformation.
But Christ appeared as a High Priest of the good things to come, through the greater and more perfect tabernacle, not made with hands, that is, not of this creation.
He did not enter by the blood of goats and calves, but by His own blood He entered the Most Holy Place once for all, obtaining eternal redemption.
For if the blood of bulls and goats and the ashes of a heifer sprinkling the unclean sanctify for the purification of the flesh,
How much more will the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered Himself without blemish to God, cleanse your conscience from dead works to serve the living God?
And for this reason, He is the Mediator of a new covenant, so that, upon the death that occurred for the redemption of the transgressions committed under the first covenant, those who are called may receive the promise of the eternal inheritance.
For where there is a covenant, it is necessary that the death of the one who made it be presented.
For a covenant is enforced only in the presence of the dead; it is never valid while the one who made it is alive.
Therefore, even the first covenant was not dedicated without blood.
For when every commandment had been declared by Moses to all the people according to the law, he took the blood of calves and goats, with water, scarlet wool, and hyssop, and sprinkled both the book itself and all the people.
saying, "This is the blood of the covenant that God commanded you."
And he sprinkled both the tent and all the vessels of the ministry with the blood in like manner.
And almost all things are purified with blood according to the law, and without the shedding of blood there is no forgiveness.
Thus, it was necessary for the copies of the heavenly things to be purified with these rites, but the heavenly things themselves require better sacrifices than these.
For Christ did not enter a sanctuary made by human hands, which is only a copy of the true one; but He entered into heaven itself, now to appear in the presence of God on our behalf.
Nor did He enter heaven to offer Himself repeatedly, as the high priest enters the Most Holy Place every year with blood not his own.
For then He would have had to suffer repeatedly since the foundation of the world; but now, at the conclusion of the ages, He has appeared once for all to put away sin by the sacrifice of Himself.
And just as it is appointed for men to die once, and after that comes judgment,
So Christ was offered once to bear the sins of many; He will appear a second time, not to deal with sin but to bring salvation to those who are eagerly waiting for Him.
For the Law, having a shadow of the good things to come and not the very image of those things, can never, through the same sacrifices offered continually year after year, make perfect those who draw near.
For if they had been able to make the worshipers completely free from guilt, they would have ceased being offered, since the worshipers would no longer have any awareness of sin.
But in those sacrifices, there is a continual reminder of sins year after year.
For it is impossible for the blood of bulls and goats to take away sins.
Therefore, when he comes into the world, he says: ‘Sacrifice and offering you did not desire, but a body you have prepared for me.’
In whole burnt offerings and sacrifices for sin you took no pleasure.
Then I said, ‘Behold, I have come; in the scroll of the book it is written of me, to do your will, O God.’
When He said above, ‘Sacrifices and offerings, and burnt offerings and sin offerings, You did not desire, nor did You take pleasure in them’—these are offered according to the Law.
Then He said, ‘Behold, I have come to do Your will, O God.’ He takes away the first covenant to establish the second.
By this divine will, we are made holy through the single offering of the body of Jesus Christ.
And every priest stands daily at his service, offering repeatedly the same sacrifices, which can never take away sins.
But when Christ had offered for all time a single sacrifice for sins, he sat down at the right hand of God.
He is now waiting expectantly until his enemies are made a footstool under his feet.
For by a single offering, He has perfected for all time those who are being sanctified.
And the Holy Spirit also bears witness to us; for after saying these things,
This is the covenant that I will make with them after those days, says the Lord: I will place my laws upon their hearts, and on their minds, I will write them.
And their sins and their lawless deeds I will remember no more.
Where there is forgiveness of these, there is no longer any offering for sin.
Therefore, brothers and sisters, since we have confidence to enter the Most Holy Place by the blood of Jesus,
which He inaugurated for us, a new and living way, through the curtain, that is, His flesh.
And since we have a great priest over the house of God,
Let us draw near with a true heart, in full assurance of faith, having our hearts sprinkled clean from an evil conscience and our bodies washed with pure water.
Let us hold unswervingly to the confession of our hope, for He who promised is faithful.
And let us consider how to stir up one another to love and good works.
not neglecting to meet together, as is the habit of some, but encouraging one another, and all the more as you see the Day drawing near.
For if we deliberately continue to sin after receiving the knowledge of the truth, there no longer remains a sacrifice for sins.
But a fearful expectation of judgment, and a fiery zeal that will consume those who stand against Him.
Anyone who disregards the law of Moses dies without mercy on the testimony of two or three witnesses.
How much worse punishment do you think will be deserved by one who has trampled underfoot the Son of God, and has treated as common the blood of the covenant by which he was sanctified, and has outraged the Spirit of grace?
For we know the one who said, 'Vengeance is mine; I will repay,' and again, 'The Lord will judge His people.'
It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.
But remember the former days, when you were illuminated; you endured a great struggle with sufferings.
Partly by being made a spectacle, both by reproaches and tribulations; and partly by becoming companions of those who were so treated.
For you showed sympathy to my chains and joyfully accepted the plundering of your property, knowing that you have a better possession and an enduring one in heaven.
Therefore, do not throw away your confidence, which carries a great reward.
For you have need of endurance, so that after you have done the will of God, you may receive the promise.
For yet a little while, and He who is coming will come and will not delay.
But the righteous shall live by faith; and if he draws back, My soul takes no pleasure in him.
But we are not of those who shrink back to destruction, but of those who have faith unto the preservation of the soul.
Now faith is the assurance of things hoped for, the conviction of things not seen.
For by this faith, the elders received their commendation.
By faith we understand that the universe was formed by the word of God, so that what is seen did not come from what is visible.
By faith, Abel offered to God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain, through which he was commended as righteous, God testifying of his gifts; and through faith, though he died, he still speaks.
By faith, Enoch was taken away so that he would not see death, and was not found, because God had taken him; for before he was taken, he had this testimony, that he pleased God.
But without faith, it is impossible to please Him; for he who comes to God must believe that He is, and that He is a rewarder of those who diligently seek Him.
By faith, Noah, being warned of things not yet seen, moved with godly fear and prepared an ark for the saving of his household, by which he condemned the world and became an heir of the righteousness which is according to faith.
By faith, Abraham, when called, obeyed and went out to a place that he was to receive as an inheritance, and he went out not knowing where he was going.
By faith he dwelt in the land of promise as in a foreign country, living in tents with Isaac and Jacob, fellow heirs of the same promise.
For he was looking forward to the city with foundations, whose architect and builder is God.
By faith, Sarah received strength to conceive seed, and she bore a child even when she was past the age, since she judged Him faithful who had promised.
Therefore, from one man, and him as good as dead, were born descendants as numerous as the stars of heaven and as countless as the grains of sand by the seashore.
In faith, all these died without receiving the promises; but they saw them from afar and greeted them, confessing that they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth.
For those who speak in this way make it clear that they are seeking a homeland.
And if they had been thinking of the land from which they had gone out, they would have had the opportunity to return.
But now they desire a better country, that is, a heavenly one. Therefore God is not ashamed to be called their God, for He has prepared for them a city.
By faith, Abraham offered up Isaac when he was tested, and he who had received the promises was ready to offer his one and only son.
of whom it was said, "Through Isaac shall your descendants be named."
He reasoned that God was able to raise him from the dead, from which he also received him figuratively.
By faith, Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau concerning the things to come.
By faith, Jacob, as he was dying, blessed each of the sons of Joseph and worshiped, leaning on the top of his staff.
By faith, Joseph, at the end of his life, spoke about the exodus of the sons of Israel and gave instructions concerning his bones.
By faith, when Moses was born, he was hidden for three months by his parents because they saw that he was a beautiful child, and they were not afraid of the king's edict.
By faith, Moses, when he had grown up, refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter,
choosing rather to suffer affliction with the people of God than to enjoy the fleeting pleasures of sin.
He regarded the disgrace for the sake of Christ as greater wealth than the treasures of Egypt, for he was looking ahead to his reward.
By faith, he left Egypt, not fearing the wrath of the king; for he endured as seeing Him who is invisible.
By faith, he instituted the Passover and the sprinkling of the blood, so that the destroyer of the firstborn would not touch them.
By faith, they crossed the Red Sea as if on dry land, which the Egyptians attempted to do and were drowned.
By faith, the walls of Jericho fell down after they had been encircled for seven days.
By faith, Rahab the prostitute did not perish with those who were disobedient, having received the spies with peace.
And what more shall I say? For time would fail me to tell of Gideon, Barak, Samson, Jephthah, David, Samuel, and the prophets.
who through faith conquered kingdoms, enforced justice, obtained promises, shut the mouths of lions,
they quenched the power of fire, escaped the edge of the sword, were made strong out of weakness, became mighty in war, put foreign armies to flight.
Women received back their dead through resurrection. Others were tortured, refusing to accept release, so that they might rise to a better resurrection.
But others endured mockings and scourgings, as well as chains and imprisonment.
They were stoned, they were sawn in two, they were tempted, they were slain with the sword; they wandered about in sheepskins and goatskins, being destitute, afflicted, tormented.
of whom the world was not worthy; they wandered in deserts and mountains, in dens and caves of the earth.
And all these, having been commended through their faith, did not receive what was promised.
God had provided something better for us, so that apart from us they should not be made perfect.
Therefore, since we are surrounded by such a great cloud of witnesses, let us lay aside every weight and the sin that so easily entangles us, and let us run with endurance the race that is set before us.
Fixing our eyes on Jesus, the author and perfecter of faith, who for the joy set before Him endured the cross, despising the shame, and has sat down at the right hand of the throne of God.
For consider Him who endured such hostility from sinners against Himself, so that you may not grow weary in your souls and lose heart.
You have not yet resisted to the point of shedding blood in your struggle against sin.
And you have forgotten the exhortation that addresses you as sons: 'My son, do not take lightly the Lord's discipline, nor be weary when He rebukes you;'
For the Lord disciplines those He loves, and He punishes every son whom He accepts.
If you endure discipline, God is treating you as sons. For what son is not disciplined by his father?
If you are without discipline, in which all have shared, then you are illegitimate children and not true sons.
Furthermore, we have had human fathers who disciplined us, and we respected them; shouldn’t we much more submit to the Father of spirits and live?
For they disciplined us for a short time as they thought best; but He disciplines us for our good, that we may share in His holiness.
Now, no discipline seems pleasant at the moment, but rather painful; yet afterward it yields the peaceful fruit of righteousness to those who have been trained by it.
Therefore, strengthen the drooping hands and steady the unsteady knees.
And make straight paths for your feet, so that what is lame may not be put out of joint, but rather be healed.
Strive for peace with everyone, and for the holiness without which no one will see the Lord.
See to it that no one falls short of the grace of God, and that no root of bitterness springs up and causes trouble, and by it many become defiled.
See to it that no one is a fornicator or profane like Esau, who sold his birthright for a single meal.
For you know that afterward, when he desired to inherit the blessing, he was rejected, for he found no opportunity for repentance, though he sought it with tears.
For you have not come to a mountain that can be touched and that is burning with fire; to darkness, gloom, and tempest.
And the sound of the trumpet and the voice of words, which those who heard it begged that no further word should be spoken to them.
For they could not endure the command that was given: ‘If even a beast touches the mountain, it shall be stoned.’
And so terrifying was the sight that Moses said, ‘I am full of fear and trembling.’
But you have come to Mount Zion, the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, and to countless angels in joyful assembly.
To the joyful assembly and congregation of the firstborn, whose names are registered in heaven, and to God the judge of all, and to the spirits of the righteous who have been made perfect.
and to Jesus, the mediator of a new covenant, and to the blood of sprinkling that speaks better things than that of Abel.
See that you do not refuse Him who speaks. For if they did not escape who refused him who spoke on earth, much more shall we not escape if we turn away from Him who speaks from heaven.
Whose voice then shook the earth; but now He has promised, saying, 'Yet once more I will shake not only the earth, but also heaven.'
This phrase, 'Yet once more,' indicates the removal of things that are shaken, as of things that have been made, in order that what cannot be shaken may remain.
Therefore, receiving a kingdom that cannot be shaken, let us be thankful, and so worship God acceptably with reverence and awe.
For our God is a consuming fire.
Let brotherly love continue; do not forget to show hospitality to strangers.
For by doing so, some have unknowingly welcomed angels.
Remember those in prison as if you were their fellow prisoners, and those who are mistreated as if you yourselves were suffering in the body.
Let marriage be honored by all, and let the marriage bed be kept undefiled; for God will judge the sexually immoral and adulterers.
Let your character be free from the love of money, being content with what you have; for He Himself has said, 'I will never leave you nor forsake you.'
So we confidently say, 'The Lord is my helper; I will not be afraid. What can man do to me?'
Remember your leaders, those who spoke to you the word of God. Consider the outcome of their way of life and imitate their faith.
Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today, and forever.
Do not be led away by various and strange teachings; for it is good for the heart to be strengthened by grace, not by foods, which have not benefited those who are devoted to them.
We have an altar from which those who serve in the tabernacle have no right to eat.
For the bodies of those animals whose blood is brought into the Holy Places by the high priest as a sacrifice for sin are burned outside the camp.
Therefore, Jesus also suffered outside the gate, in order to sanctify the people through His own blood.
Therefore, let us go to Him outside the camp, bearing His reproach.
For we do not have here a lasting city, but we seek the one that is to come.
Through Him then, let us continually offer a sacrifice of praise to God, that is, the fruit of lips that acknowledge His name.
And do not forget to do good and to share with others, for with such sacrifices God is pleased.
Obey your leaders and submit to them, for they keep watch over your souls as those who must give an account. Let them do this with joy and not with grief, for that would be of no advantage to you.
Pray for us; for we are sure that we have a good conscience, desiring to conduct ourselves honorably in all things.
But I urge you even more to do this, so that I may be quickly restored to you.
Now may the God of peace, who brought up from the dead our Lord Jesus, the great Shepherd of the sheep, through the blood of the everlasting covenant,
May He equip you in every good work to do His will, working in you what is pleasing in His sight, through Jesus Christ, to whom be glory forever and ever. Amen.
But I urge you, brothers, to bear with my word of encouragement; for I have written to you briefly.
Know that our brother Timothy has been released; with whom, if he comes soon, I shall see you.
Greet all your leaders and all the saints. Those from Italy send you greetings.
May the grace be with all of you. Amen.
James, a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ, to the twelve tribes scattered among the nations: Greetings.
Consider it pure joy, my brothers and sisters, whenever you face trials of many kinds.
Knowing that the testing of your faith produces patience.
But let patience have its full effect, so that you may be perfect and complete, lacking in nothing.
If any of you lacks wisdom, let him ask of God, who gives generously to all without finding fault, and it will be given to him.
But let him ask in faith, with no doubting; for he who doubts is like a wave of the sea, driven and tossed by the wind.
For let not that man suppose that he will receive anything from the Lord.
A double-minded man is unstable in all his ways.
But let the lowly brother boast in his exaltation.
But the rich should take pride in their humiliation, because like a wildflower, they will pass away.
For the sun rises with scorching heat and withers the grass; its flower falls and the beauty of its appearance perishes. So also will the rich fade away in the midst of their pursuits.
Blessed is the man who endures temptation; for when he has stood the test, he will receive the crown of life that the Lord has promised to those who love Him.
Let no one who is being tempted say, 'I am being tempted by God,' for God cannot be tempted by evil, nor does He Himself tempt anyone.
But each person is tempted when he is drawn away and enticed by his own desire.
Then, when desire has fully conceived, it gives birth to sin; and sin, when it is fully grown, brings forth death.
Do not be misled, my beloved brothers; 
Every good gift and every perfect blessing is from above, coming down from the Father of lights, with whom there is no variation or shadow due to change.
Of His own will He brought us forth by the word of truth, that we should be a kind of firstfruits of His creatures.
Therefore, my beloved brothers, let every person be quick to listen, slow to speak, and slow to anger.
For the anger of man does not produce the righteousness of God.
Therefore, laying aside all filthiness and abundance of wickedness, with meekness receive the implanted Word, which is able to save your souls.
But be doers of the word, and not merely hearers, deceiving yourselves.
For if anyone is a hearer of the word and not a doer, he is like a man observing his natural face in a mirror;.
For he observed himself, went away, and immediately forgot what kind of man he was.
But he who looks into the perfect law of liberty and perseveres, not being a forgetful hearer but a doer of the work, this man will be blessed in what he does.
If anyone thinks himself to be religious and does not bridle his tongue, but deceives his own heart, this one's religion is worthless.
Pure and undefiled religion before God the Father is this: to visit orphans and widows in their affliction, and to keep oneself unblemished from the world.
My brothers and sisters, do not hold your faith in our glorious Lord Jesus Christ with partiality.
For if there should come into your assembly a man with a gold ring, dressed in splendid clothes, and also there comes in a poor man in filthy garments,
And if you pay attention to the one wearing the fine clothing and say, 'You sit here in a good place,' but to the poor man you say, 'You stand there' or 'Sit here at my feet,'
Have you not then made distinctions among yourselves and become judges with evil thoughts?
Listen, my beloved brothers. Has not God chosen the poor of this world to be rich in faith and heirs of the kingdom which He promised to those who love Him?
But you have dishonored the poor man. Do not the rich oppress you and drag you into courts?
Are they not the ones who blaspheme the honorable name by which you are called?
If you truly fulfill the royal law according to the Scripture, ‘You shall love your neighbor as yourself,’ you are doing well.
But if you show favoritism, you commit sin and are convicted by the law as transgressors.
For whoever keeps the whole law but stumbles at just one point is guilty of breaking all of it.
For He who said, 'You shall not commit adultery,' also said, 'You shall not murder.' If you do not commit adultery but you murder, you have become a lawbreaker.
So speak and act as those who are to be judged under the law of liberty.
For judgment is without mercy to the one who has shown no mercy. Mercy triumphs over judgment.
What good is it, my brothers, if someone claims to have faith but does not have works? Can that faith save him?
If a brother or sister is without clothing and lacks daily food,
And if someone says to them, 'Go in peace, be warm and filled,' yet does not provide for their physical needs, what good is that?
So also faith, if it does not have works, is dead by itself.
But someone will say, 'You have faith, and I have works.' Show me your faith apart from your works, and I will show you my faith by my works.
You believe that God is one; you do well. Even the demons believe—and shudder.
But do you want to know, O foolish man, that faith without works is dead?
Was not our father Abraham justified by works when he offered Isaac his son on the altar?
You see that faith was active together with his works, and by works, faith was brought to completion.
And the Scripture was fulfilled that says, 'Abraham believed God, and it was credited to him as righteousness,' and he was called a friend of God.
You see that a person is justified by works and not by faith alone.
In the same way, was not Rahab the harlot also justified by her actions when she welcomed the spies and sent them out by another way?
For just as the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without deeds is also dead.
Not many of you should become teachers, my brothers, because you know that we who teach will be judged more strictly.
For we all stumble in many ways. And if anyone does not stumble in what he says, he is a perfect man, able to control his whole body.
Consider the horses; we put bits in their mouths to guide them, and with them, we can steer their entire body.
Look at the ships; though they are so large and driven by fierce winds, they are turned about by a very small rudder wherever the helmsman desires.
So also the tongue is a small member, yet it boasts of great things. Behold, how great a forest is set ablaze by such a small fire!
And the tongue is a fire, the world of iniquity. Thus, the tongue can defile the whole body and set ablaze the course of our lives, being ignited by hell.
For every kind of beast and bird, reptile and sea creature, can be tamed and has been tamed by mankind's nature.
But no human being can tame the tongue; it is a restless evil, full of deadly poison.
With it we bless our Lord and Father, and with it we curse people made in the likeness of God.
From the same mouth come both blessing and cursing. My brothers, this should not be so.
Does a spring pour forth from the same opening both fresh and bitter water?
My brothers, can a fig tree bear olives, or a grapevine produce figs? Neither can a salt spring yield fresh water.
Who among you is wise and understanding? Let them show it by their good life, by deeds done in the humility that comes from wisdom.
But if you harbor bitter envy and selfish ambition in your hearts, do not boast about it or deny the truth.
This wisdom is not that which comes down from above, but is earthly, unspiritual, and demonic.
For where jealousy and selfish ambition exist, there is disorder and every vile practice.
But the wisdom that comes from above is first pure, then peace-loving, considerate, submissive, full of mercy and good fruit, impartial and sincere.
And the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace by those who make peace.
What causes conflicts and quarrels among you? Is it not your passions that wage war within you?
You desire but do not have; you kill and covet, but you cannot obtain; you fight and quarrel. You do not have because you do not ask.
You ask, and yet you do not receive, because you ask with wrong motives, so that you may spend it on your pleasures.
You adulterous people! Don’t you know that friendship with the world means enmity against God? Therefore, anyone who chooses to be a friend of the world becomes an enemy of God.
Or do you think that the Scripture says without reason, 'He yearns jealously for the spirit He has caused to dwell in us'?
But He gives a greater grace. Therefore it says, 'God opposes the proud, but gives grace to the humble.'
Therefore, submit yourselves to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you.
Draw near to God, and He will draw near to you. Cleanse your hands, you sinners, and purify your hearts, you double-minded.
Be afflicted, and mourn, and weep; let your laughter be turned to mourning, and your joy to heaviness.
Humble yourselves in the presence of the Lord, and He will lift you up.
Do not speak against one another, brothers. The one who speaks against a brother or judges his brother speaks against the law and judges the law. But if you judge the law, you are not a doer of the law but a judge.
There is only one Lawgiver and Judge, the one who has the power to save and to destroy. But who are you to judge your neighbor?
Come now, you who say, 'Today or tomorrow we will go into this city and spend a year there, and trade and make a profit.'
Yet you do not know what tomorrow will bring. For what is your life? It is a mist that appears for a little while and then vanishes.
Instead, you ought to say, 'If the Lord wills, we will live and do this or that.'
But now you boast in your arrogance; all such boasting is evil.
Therefore, to know the good that one ought to do and not to do it, is sin for that person.
Come now, you rich, weep and wail for the miseries that are coming upon you!
Your wealth has rotted, and your garments are moth-eaten.
Your gold and silver are corroded, and their corrosion will be a testimony against you and will eat your flesh like fire. You have laid up treasure in the last days.
Behold, the wages of the laborers who harvested your fields, which you kept back by fraud, cry out; and the cries of the reapers have reached the ears of the Lord of hosts.
You have lived luxuriously on the earth and indulged yourselves; you have fattened your hearts in a day of slaughter.
You have condemned and murdered the righteous one; he does not resist you.
Therefore, brothers, be patient until the coming of the Lord. See how the farmer waits for the precious fruit of the earth, being patient for it until he receives the early and late rains.
You also, be patient; strengthen your hearts, for the coming of the Lord is near.
Do not grumble against one another, brothers, lest you be judged; behold, the Judge is standing at the door.
As examples of suffering and patience, brothers, take the prophets who spoke in the name of the Lord.
Indeed, we consider those blessed who have persevered. You have heard of the endurance of Job, and you have seen the outcome that the Lord brought about—how the Lord is full of compassion and mercy.
Above all, my brothers, do not swear, either by heaven or by earth or by any other oath; but let your yes be yes, and your no be no, so that you may not fall under judgment.
Is anyone among you suffering? Let him pray. Is anyone cheerful? Let him sing praise.
Is anyone among you sick? Let him call for the elders of the church, and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord.
And the prayer offered in faith will heal the sick, and the Lord will raise him up; and if he has committed sins, they will be forgiven him.
Therefore, confess your sins to one another and pray for each other, so that you may be healed. The prayer of a righteous person is powerful and effective.
Elijah was a man with a nature like ours, and he fervently prayed that it would not rain; and it did not rain on the earth for three years and six months.
And again he prayed, and the heavens gave rain, and the earth yielded its fruit.
Brothers, if anyone among you wanders from the truth and someone brings him back,
Let him know that whoever turns a sinner back from the error of his way will save a soul from death and will cover a multitude of sins.
Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ, to the elect who are temporary residents of the dispersion in Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia,
according to the foreknowledge of God the Father, in the sanctification of the Spirit, for obedience and the sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ: may grace and peace be multiplied to you.
Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ! According to His great mercy, He has caused us to be born again to a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead.
to an inheritance that is imperishable, undefiled, and unfading, kept in heaven for you.
who are protected by the power of God through faith for a salvation ready to be revealed in the last time.
In this you rejoice greatly, even though for a little while, if necessary, you may have to suffer through various trials.
so that the genuineness of your faith, which is more precious than gold that perishes though it is tested by fire, may be found to result in praise, glory, and honor at the revelation of Jesus Christ.
Though you have not seen Him, you love Him; though you do not now see Him, you believe in Him and rejoice with a joy that is inexpressible and filled with glory.
obtaining the outcome of your faith, the salvation of your souls.
Concerning this salvation, the prophets diligently sought and inquired, who prophesied of the grace that would come to you.
searching carefully to know what time or manner of time the Spirit of Christ within them was indicating, as He foretold the sufferings that would come upon Christ and the glories that would follow.
It was revealed to them that they were not serving themselves, but you, in the things that have now been announced to you through those who preached the good news to you by the Holy Spirit sent from heaven—things into which angels long to look.
Therefore, prepare your minds for action; be sober-minded; set your hope completely on the grace that will be brought to you at the revelation of Jesus Christ.
As obedient children, do not conform to the former desires that you had in your ignorance.
But as the One who called you is holy, you also be holy in all your conduct.
For it is written: 'You shall be holy, for I am holy.'
And if you call on the Father who judges impartially according to each one's work, conduct yourselves with reverent fear during your time as strangers here.
For you know that it was not with perishable things, such as silver or gold, that you were redeemed from the empty way of life handed down to you from your ancestors,
but with the precious blood of Christ, like that of a lamb without blemish and without defect.
He was chosen before the foundation of the world, but was revealed in these last times for your sake.
Through Him, you believe in God, who raised Him from the dead and gave Him glory, so that your faith and hope are in God.
Since you have purified your souls by obeying the truth through the Spirit for sincere brotherly love, love one another earnestly from a pure heart.
For you have been born again, not from perishable seed, but from imperishable, through the living and abiding word of God.
For all flesh is like grass, and all its glory is like the flower of grass; the grass withers, and the flower falls away.
But the word of the Lord endures forever. And this is the word that was preached to you.
Therefore, laying aside all malice, all deceit, hypocrisy, envy, and all slander,
Like newborn infants, long for the pure spiritual milk, that by it you may grow up into salvation.
if indeed you have tasted that the Lord is good.
To whom coming as to a living stone, rejected indeed by men, but chosen by God and precious,
You also, as living stones, are being built up a spiritual house, a holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices that are acceptable to God through Jesus Christ.
For it stands in Scripture: 'Behold, I lay in Zion a chosen and precious cornerstone, and he who believes in Him will never be put to shame.'
To you therefore, who believe, He is precious; but to those who are disobedient, the stone which the builders rejected has become the chief cornerstone.
They stumble because they disobey the word, to which they also were appointed.
But you are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people set apart, that you may proclaim the praises of Him who called you out of darkness into His marvelous light.
Once you were not a people, but now you are the people of God; you had not received mercy, but now you have received mercy.
Beloved, I urge you as sojourners and exiles to abstain from the passions of the flesh, which wage war against your soul.
Maintain good conduct among the Gentiles, so that in the thing they slander you as evildoers, they may observe your good deeds and glorify God on the day of visitation.
Submit yourselves, therefore, to every human authority for the Lord's sake, whether to the emperor as the supreme authority,
or to governors, as sent by him for the punishment of those who do evil and for the praise of those who do good.
For this is the will of God, that by doing good you should silence the ignorance of foolish men.
Act as free people, but do not use your freedom as a cover for evil; rather, serve God as His slaves.
Honor everyone. Love the brotherhood. Fear God. Honor the king.
Servants, be submissive to your masters with all respect, not only to those who are kind and gentle, but also to those who are harsh.
For this is commendable, if someone endures pain because of their conscience toward God, suffering unjustly.
For what credit is it if you endure punishment for doing wrong? But if you endure suffering for doing good, this is commendable before God.
For to this you were called, because Christ also suffered for you, leaving you an example that you should follow in His steps.
Who committed no sin, nor was deceit found in His mouth.
Who, being insulted, did not retaliate; suffering, He did not threaten, but committed Himself to Him who judges righteously.
Who Himself bore our sins in His body on the tree, that we, having died to sins, might live for righteousness; by whose stripes you were healed.
For you were like sheep going astray, but now you have returned to the Shepherd and Overseer of your souls.
Likewise, wives, be submissive to your own husbands, so that even if some do not obey the word, they may be won over without a word by the conduct of their wives.
when they observe your chaste and respectful conduct, accompanied by reverence.
Let your adornment not be merely outward—arranging the hair, wearing gold, or putting on fine apparel;.
But let your beauty be that of the inner person, the imperishable beauty of a gentle and quiet spirit, which is precious in the sight of God.
For in this way, holy women of old who hoped in God adorned themselves, being submissive to their own husbands.
just as Sarah obeyed Abraham, calling him lord. You are her daughters if you do good and do not fear anything that is frightening.
In the same way, husbands, live with your wives in an understanding manner, showing honor to the woman as the weaker vessel, since they are heirs together of the grace of life, so that your prayers may not be hindered.
Finally, all of you, be harmonious, sympathetic, loving as brothers, tender-hearted, and humble-minded.
Do not repay evil for evil, or insult for insult. On the contrary, bless them, for to this you were called, that you may inherit a blessing.
For whoever desires to love life and see good days must keep their tongue from evil and their lips from speaking deceit.
Let him turn away from evil and do good; let him seek peace and pursue it.
For the eyes of the Lord are on the righteous, and His ears are open to their prayer; but the face of the Lord is against those who do evil.
And who is there to harm you if you are zealous for what is good?
But even if you should suffer for righteousness' sake, you are blessed. And do not fear their threats, nor be troubled.
But in your hearts set apart Christ as Lord. Always be prepared to give an answer to everyone who asks you to give the reason for the hope that you have. Yet do this with gentleness and respect.
Keeping a good conscience, so that when they speak against you as evildoers, those who revile your good behavior in Christ may be ashamed.
For it is better, if it is God's will, to suffer for doing good than for doing evil.
For Christ also suffered once for sins, the righteous for the unrighteous, to bring us to God; He was put to death in the flesh, but made alive in the spirit.
In this, He went and proclaimed to the spirits in prison,
who once were disobedient, when God's patience waited in the days of Noah, while the ark was being prepared, in which a few, that is, eight souls, were saved through water.
This baptism, which is an antitype, now saves us, not by the removal of dirt from the body, but as an appeal to God for a good conscience, through the resurrection of Jesus Christ.
who has gone into heaven and is at the right hand of God, with angels and authorities and powers having been subjected to Him.
Therefore, since Christ suffered in the flesh for us, arm yourselves also with the same mindset, because the one who has suffered in the flesh has ceased from sin.
So as to live the rest of their time in the flesh, no longer for human desires, but for the will of God.
For you have had enough time in the past to carry out the desires of the Gentiles, indulging in sensuality, passions, drunkenness, revelries, drinking parties, and lawless idolatries.
With respect to this, they are surprised when you do not join them in the same flood of debauchery, and they malign you; 
But they will give an account to him who is prepared to judge the living and the dead.
For this reason the gospel was preached also to those who are dead, that they might be judged according to men in the flesh, but live according to God in the spirit.
But the end of all things has drawn near. Therefore, be serious and watchful in your prayers.
Above all, maintain fervent love for one another, because love covers a multitude of sins.
Show hospitality to one another without complaining.
As each one has received a gift, use it to serve one another, as good stewards of the varied grace of God.
If anyone speaks, let him speak as one who speaks the very words of God; if anyone serves, let him serve by the strength that God provides, so that in everything God may be glorified through Jesus Christ. To Him belong glory and dominion forever and ever. Amen.
Beloved, do not be surprised at the fiery ordeal that has come upon you, as though something strange were happening to you.
But to the extent that you share in the sufferings of Christ, rejoice, so that when His glory is revealed, you may also rejoice with exceeding joy.
If you are reproached for the name of Christ, you are blessed, because the Spirit of glory and of God rests upon you. On their part, He is blasphemed, but on your part, He is glorified.
But let none of you suffer as a murderer, or a thief, or an evildoer, or as a meddler in other people's matters.
But if anyone suffers as a Christian, let him not be ashamed, but let him glorify God in that name.
For the time has come for judgment to begin at the house of God; and if it begins with us first, what will be the end of those who do not obey the gospel of God?
And if the righteous are scarcely saved, where will the ungodly and the sinner appear?
Therefore, let those who suffer according to God’s will commit their souls to a faithful Creator while doing good.
So I exhort the elders among you, as a fellow elder and a witness of the sufferings of Christ, as well as a partaker in the glory that is to be revealed:
Shepherd the flock of God that is among you, exercising oversight, not under compulsion, but willingly, as God would have you; not for shameful gain, but eagerly.
not as domineering over those in your charge, but being examples to the flock.
And when the Chief Shepherd appears, you will receive the unfading crown of glory.
Likewise, you younger ones, submit yourselves to your elders. Yes, all of you be submissive to one another, and be clothed with humility, for God opposes the proud but gives grace to the humble.
Therefore, humble yourselves under the mighty hand of God, so that He may exalt you in due time.
Cast all your worries upon Him, because He cares deeply for you.
Be alert and of sober mind. Your enemy the devil prowls around like a roaring lion looking for someone to devour.
Stand firm against him, steadfast in your faith, knowing that the same kinds of sufferings are being accomplished in your brotherhood throughout the world.
And after you have suffered a little while, the God of all grace, who has called you to his eternal glory in Christ, will himself restore, strengthen, confirm, and establish you.
To Him belongs the glory and the power forever and ever. Amen.
Through Silvanus, your faithful brother, I have written to you briefly, encouraging you and solemnly testifying that this is the true grace of God in which you stand.
She who is in Babylon, chosen together with you, sends you greetings, and so does Mark, my son.
Greet one another with a kiss of love. Peace be to all of you who are in Christ Jesus. Amen.
Simon Peter, a servant and apostle of Jesus Christ, to those who have obtained a faith of equal standing with ours through the righteousness of our God and Savior, Jesus Christ.
May grace and peace be multiplied to you in the knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord.
His divine power has granted to us all things that pertain to life and godliness, through the knowledge of him who called us to his own glory and excellence.
Through these, He has granted to us His most precious and magnificent promises, so that through them you may become partakers of the divine nature, having escaped from the corruption that is in the world because of sinful desire.
For this very reason, make every effort to supplement your faith with virtue, and virtue with knowledge,
and in knowledge, self-control; and in self-control, endurance; and in endurance, godliness;
and in godliness, brotherly love; and in brotherly love, love.
For if these qualities are yours and abound, they will keep you from being ineffective and unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ.
For whoever lacks these qualities is blind, having forgotten the purification from their former sins.
Therefore, brothers, be all the more diligent to confirm your calling and election; for if you practice these qualities, you will never stumble.
For in this way, an abundant welcome will be provided for you into the eternal kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.
Therefore, I will always be ready to remind you of these things, even though you already know them and are firmly established in the truth that you now hold.
But I consider it right, as long as I am in this tent, to awaken you by reminding you.
knowing that my departure from this earthly tent is imminent, as our Lord Jesus Christ has made clear to me.
And I will make every effort to ensure that you can remember these things even after my departure.
For we did not follow cleverly devised myths when we made known to you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but we were eyewitnesses of his majesty.
For He received honor and glory from God the Father when the voice was borne to Him by the majestic glory, saying, 'This is my beloved Son, with whom I am well pleased.'
And we heard this voice borne from heaven while we were with Him on the holy mountain.
And we have the more certain prophetic word, to which you do well to pay attention as to a lamp shining in a dark place, until the day dawns and the morning star rises in your hearts.
First of all, understand this: No prophecy of Scripture comes from one’s own interpretation.
For no prophecy ever came by the will of man, but men moved by the Holy Spirit spoke from God.
But there were also false prophets among the people, just as there will be false teachers among you, who will secretly introduce destructive heresies, denying the Sovereign Lord who bought them, bringing swift destruction upon themselves.
And many will follow their depraved conduct, and as a result, the way of truth will be maligned.
And in their greed, they will exploit you with deceptive words; their judgment has long been hanging over them, and their destruction is not idle.
For if God did not spare the angels who sinned, but cast them down to the dark abyss of Tartarus, reserving them for judgment.
And He did not spare the ancient world, but preserved Noah, a herald of righteousness, when He brought a flood upon the world of the ungodly.
And He condemned the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah to ashes, having made them an example of what is to come for those who live ungodly lives.
And delivered righteous Lot, who was greatly distressed by the lawless deeds of the wicked.
For that righteous man, living among them, was tormented in his righteous soul day after day by their lawless deeds.
The Lord knows how to rescue the godly from trials, and to hold the unrighteous for the day of judgment, while keeping them in punishment.
Especially those who indulge in the desires of the flesh and despise authority. Bold and self-willed, they are not afraid to blaspheme glorious beings.
Whereas angels, who are greater in strength and power, do not bring a slanderous accusation against them before the Lord.
But these, like unreasoning animals born to be caught and destroyed, blaspheming in matters they do not understand, will also perish in their corruption.
They will receive the wages of their unrighteousness, reveling in their pleasure during the day. They are blots and blemishes, indulging in their deceitful ways while they feast with you.
Having eyes full of adultery and insatiable for sin, they entice unstable souls. They have hearts trained in greed; accursed children!
They have forsaken the straight way and gone astray, following the path of Balaam son of Beor, who loved the wages of unrighteousness.
But he was rebuked for his own transgression; a dumb beast, speaking with a human voice, restrained the madness of the prophet.
These are like waterless springs and clouds driven by a tempest; for them, the gloom of utter darkness has been reserved forever.
For they speak inflated words of emptiness, enticing those who barely escape from the desires of the flesh, luring them into reckless abandon.
They promise them freedom, but they themselves are slaves of corruption; for whatever overcomes a person, to that he is enslaved.
For if, after having escaped the defilements of the world through the knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, they are again entangled in them and overcome, the last state has become worse for them than the first.
For it would have been better for them not to have known the way of righteousness than to have known it and then turned back from the holy commandment delivered to them.
But it has happened to them according to the true proverb: "A dog returns to its own vomit," and, "A pig, after washing, returns to wallow in the mire."
This is now, beloved, the second letter I am writing to you, in which I am stirring up your sincere mind by way of reminder.
to remember the words spoken beforehand by the holy prophets and the commandment of your apostles of the Lord and Savior.
First of all, know this: In the last days, scoffers will come, following their own desires.
And they will say, ‘Where is the promise of His coming? For since our forefathers fell asleep, all things continue as they were from the beginning of creation.’
For they deliberately overlook this fact: that long ago the heavens were formed, and the earth was established out of water and through water by the word of God.
Through which the world that then existed was deluged with water and perished.
But the present heavens and the earth, by the same word, are stored up for fire, being kept for the day of judgment and the destruction of ungodly men.
But do not let this one thing escape your notice, beloved, that with the Lord one day is as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day.
The Lord is not delaying his promise, as some count delay, but is being patient with us, not wishing for any to perish but for all to come to repentance.
But the day of the Lord will come like a thief in the night; in which the heavens will pass away with a great noise, and the elements will be burned up and dissolved, and the earth and the works that are in it will be burned up.
Since all these things are to be dissolved, what sort of people ought you to be in lives of holiness and godliness?
waiting for and hastening the coming of the day of God, because of which the heavens will be set ablaze and the elements will melt in the fire!
But according to His promise, we are waiting for new heavens and a new earth, in which righteousness dwells.
Therefore, beloved, since you are waiting for these things, be diligent to be found by Him without spot or blemish, and at peace.
And consider the patience of our Lord as salvation, just as our beloved brother Paul also wrote to you according to the wisdom given to him.
as he does in all his letters when he speaks in them of these matters. There are some things in them that are hard to understand, which the ignorant and unstable twist to their own destruction, as they do the other Scriptures.
Therefore, beloved, knowing this in advance, take care that you are not led astray by the error of lawless people and fall from your own stability.
But grow in grace and in the knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. To Him be glory both now and forever. Amen.
That which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes, which we have looked upon, and our hands have handled, concerning the Word of life;
And the life was revealed; we have seen it, and bear witness, and declare to you the eternal life, which was with the Father and was revealed to us.
That which we have seen and heard we declare to you, so that you also may have fellowship with us; and truly our fellowship is with the Father and with His Son, Jesus Christ.
And we write these things to you, so that our joy may be complete.
And this is the message we have heard from Him and proclaim to you, that God is light, and in Him is no darkness at all.
If we say that we have fellowship with Him and yet walk in darkness, we lie and do not practice the truth.
But if we walk in the light, as He is in the light, we have fellowship with one another, and the blood of Jesus Christ His Son cleanses us from all sin.
If we claim that we are without sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us.
If we confess our sins, He is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.
If we claim that we have not sinned, we make Him a liar, and His Word is not in us.
My dear children, I am writing these things to you so that you may not sin. But if anyone does sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous.
And He is the atoning sacrifice for our sins, and not for ours only, but also for the sins of the whole world.
And by this we know that we have come to know Him: if we keep His commandments.
The one who says, 'I have come to know Him,' but does not keep His commandments is a liar, and the truth is not in him.
But whoever keeps His word, in him the love of God is truly perfected. By this we know that we are in Him.
He who claims to abide in Him ought himself also to walk just as He walked.
Beloved, I am not writing a new commandment to you, but an old commandment that you have had from the beginning; this old commandment is the message which you heard from the beginning.
Again, I write a new commandment to you, which is true in Him and in you, because the darkness is passing away, and the true light is already shining.
Whoever claims to be in the light but hates his brother is still in darkness to this very moment.
The one who loves his brother abides in the light, and there is no cause for stumbling in him.
But the one who hates his brother is in darkness and walks in darkness, and does not know where he is going, because the darkness has blinded his eyes.
I am writing to you, little children, because your sins have been forgiven you for His name's sake.
I am writing to you, fathers, because you have come to know Him who is from the beginning. I am writing to you, young men, because you have overcome the evil one.
I have written to you, children, because you have come to know the Father. I have written to you, fathers, because you have known Him who is from the beginning. I have written to you, young men, because you are strong, and the word of God abides in you, and you have overcome the wicked one.
Do not love the world, nor the things that are in the world. If anyone loves the world, the love of the Father is not in him.
For all that is in the world—the craving of the flesh, the craving of the eyes, and the pride of life—does not come from the Father, but is of the world.
And the world is passing away along with its desires; but whoever does the will of God abides forever.
Children, it is the last hour; and as you have heard that the Antichrist is coming, so now many antichrists have arisen. Therefore, we know that it is the last hour.
They went out from us, but they were not of us; for if they had been of us, they would have continued with us. But they went out, that it might become plain that they all are not of us.
But you have an anointing from the Holy One, and you know all things.
I did not write to you because you do not know the truth, but because you know it, and because every lie is not from the truth.
Who is the liar but he who denies that Jesus is the Christ? This one is the Antichrist, who denies the Father and the Son.
Everyone who denies the Son does not have the Father; whoever confesses the Son has the Father also.
Therefore, let what you heard from the beginning remain in you. If what you heard from the beginning abides in you, you will also abide in the Son and in the Father.
And this is the promise that He has promised us: eternal life.
I have written these things to you concerning those who would deceive you.
But as for you, the anointing that you received from Him abides in you, and you have no need for anyone to teach you; but as His anointing teaches you about everything, and is true and is not a lie, and just as it has taught you, you abide in Him.
And now, little children, abide in Him, so that when He is revealed, we may have confidence and not be ashamed before Him at His coming.
If you know that He is righteous, you may be sure that everyone who practices righteousness has been born of Him.
See what kind of love the Father has given to us, that we should be called children of God; and so we are! The reason why the world does not know us is that it did not know him.
Beloved, we are now children of God, and what we will be has not yet been made known; but we know that when he appears, we shall be like him, because we shall see him as he is.
And everyone who has this hope in Him purifies himself, just as He is pure.
Everyone who practices sin also practices lawlessness; and sin is lawlessness.
And you know that He was manifested to take away our sins, and in Him there is no sin.
Everyone who abides in Him does not sin; everyone who sins has neither seen Him nor known Him.
Little children, let no one lead you astray; the one who practices righteousness is righteous, just as He is righteous.
The one who commits sin is of the devil, for the devil has been sinning from the beginning. The Son of God appeared for this purpose: to destroy the works of the devil.
Everyone who has been born of God does not commit sin, because His seed remains in him; and he cannot sin, because he has been born of God.
In this, the children of God and the children of the devil are manifest: Anyone who does not practice righteousness is not of God, nor is he who does not love his brother.
For this is the message that you heard from the beginning, that we should love one another.
not as Cain, who was of the evil one and murdered his brother. And why did he murder him? Because his own deeds were evil, but his brother's were righteous.
Do not be surprised, brothers, if the world hates you.
We know that we have passed from death to life because we love our brothers. Whoever does not love remains in death.
Everyone who hates his brother is a murderer, and you know that no murderer has eternal life abiding in him.
By this we know love, that He laid down His life for us, and we ought to lay down our lives for our brothers.
But whoever has this world's goods and sees his brother in need, yet shuts his heart against him, how can the love of God remain in him?
Little children, let us not love in word or talk but in deed and in truth.
And by this we shall know that we are of the truth, and we will assure our hearts before Him.
For if our heart condemns us, God is greater than our heart and knows all things.
Beloved, if our heart does not condemn us, we have confidence before God.
And whatever we ask, we receive from Him, because we keep His commandments and do those things that are pleasing in His sight.
And this is His command: that we should believe in the name of His Son, Jesus Christ, and love one another just as He commanded us.
And the one who keeps His commandments abides in Him, and He in them. And by this we know that He abides in us: by the Spirit whom He has given us.
Beloved, do not believe every spirit, but test the spirits to see whether they are from God, because many false prophets have gone out into the world.
By this you know the Spirit of God: every spirit that acknowledges that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is from God.
And every spirit that does not confess that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is not from God. This is the spirit of the antichrist, which you heard was coming, and now is already in the world.
You, dear children, are from God and have overcome them, because the one who is in you is greater than the one who is in the world.
They are from the world; therefore they speak from the world, and the world listens to them.
We are of God; he who knows God hears us; he who is not of God does not hear us. By this we know the spirit of truth and the spirit of error.
Dear friends, let us love one another, for love is from God; everyone who loves has been born of God and knows God.
Anyone who does not love does not know God, because God is love.
In this, the love of God was revealed among us, that God sent His one and only Son into the world so that we might live through Him.
In this is love: not that we loved God, but that He loved us and sent His Son to be the atoning sacrifice for our sins.
Beloved, if God so loved us, we also ought to love one another.
No one has ever seen God; if we love one another, God abides in us, and His love is perfected in us.
By this we know that we abide in Him and He in us, because He has given us of His Spirit.
And we have seen and testify that the Father has sent His Son to be the Savior of the world.
Whoever confesses that Jesus is the Son of God, God abides in him, and he in God.
And we have come to know and believe the love that God has for us. God is love; and he who abides in love abides in God, and God abides in him.
In this, love is perfected with us, so that we may have boldness on the day of judgment; for as He is, so are we in this world.
There is no fear in love, but perfect love casts out fear, for fear involves punishment, and whoever fears has not been made perfect in love.
We love Him because He first loved us.
If someone says, 'I love God,' and yet hates his brother, he is a liar; for the one who does not love his brother whom he has seen cannot love God whom he has not seen.
And this commandment we have from Him: that the one who loves God must also love his brother.
Everyone who believes that Jesus is the Christ has been born of God, and everyone who loves the Father loves whoever has been born of Him.
By this we know that we love the children of God, when we love God and keep His commandments.
For this is the love of God, that we keep His commandments; and His commandments are not burdensome.
For whatever is born of God conquers the world; and this is the victory that has conquered the world—our faith.
Who is it that conquers the world, except the one who believes that Jesus is the Son of God?
This is He who came by water and blood—Jesus Christ; not by water only, but by water and blood. And it is the Spirit who bears witness, because the Spirit is truth.
For there are three that bear witness in heaven: the Father, the Word, and the Holy Spirit; and these three are one.
There are three that bear witness on earth: the Spirit, the water, and the blood; and these three agree in one.
If we accept the testimony of men, the testimony of God is greater; for this is the testimony of God which He has borne concerning His Son.
The one who believes in the Son of God has the testimony in himself; the one who does not believe God has made Him a liar, because he has not believed in the testimony that God has borne concerning His Son.
And this is the testimony: God has given us eternal life, and this life is in His Son.
He who has the Son has life; he who does not have the Son of God does not have life.
I have written these things to you who believe in the name of the Son of God, so that you may know that you have eternal life, and that you may continue to believe in the name of the Son of God.
And this is the confidence we have in Him, that if we ask anything according to His will, He hears us.
And if we know that He hears us in whatever we ask, we know that we have the petitions that we have requested of Him.
If anyone sees his brother committing a sin that does not lead to death, he shall ask, and God will give him life for those who commit sin not leading to death. There is sin leading to death; I do not say that he should pray about that.
All wrongdoing is sin, and there is sin that does not lead to death.
We know that everyone born of God does not continue in sin; rather, the one born of God keeps himself, and the evil one cannot touch him.
We know that we are from God, and that the whole world lies in the grip of the evil one.
And we know that the Son of God has come and has given us understanding, so that we may know Him who is true; and we are in Him who is true, in His Son Jesus Christ. He is the true God and eternal life.
Little children, guard yourselves from idols. Amen.
The elder to the chosen lady and her children, whom I love in truth—and not I only, but also all who know the truth,
because of the truth that abides in us, and will be with us forever.
Grace, mercy, and peace will be with us from God the Father and from Jesus Christ, the Son of the Father, in truth and love.
I rejoiced greatly that I found some of your children walking in truth, just as we received commandment from the Father.
And now I ask you, dear lady, not as if I were writing you a new command, but the one we have had from the beginning, that we love one another.
And this is love: that we walk according to His commandments. This is the commandment, as you have heard from the beginning, that you should walk in it.
For many deceivers have gone out into the world, those who do not confess Jesus Christ as coming in the flesh. This is a deceiver and the Antichrist.
Watch yourselves, so that you may not lose what we have worked for, but may receive a full reward.
Everyone who goes ahead and does not abide in the teaching of Christ does not have God; whoever abides in the teaching has both the Father and the Son.
If anyone comes to you and does not bring this teaching, do not receive him into your house or give him any greeting.
For whoever greets him shares in his wicked works.
Though I have many things to write to you, I did not wish to do so with pen and ink; instead, I hope to come to you and speak face to face, that our joy may be complete.
The children of your chosen sister greet you. Amen.
The elder to Gaius, my beloved, whom I love in truth.
Beloved, I pray that in all respects you may prosper and be in good health, just as your soul is prospering.
For I rejoiced greatly when the brothers came and testified to your faithfulness to the truth, just as you are walking in the truth.
I have no greater joy than to hear that my children are walking in the truth.
Beloved, you are acting faithfully in whatever you do for the brothers and for strangers.
They have testified about your love before the church. You will do well to send them on their journey in a manner worthy of God.
For they went out for the sake of the Name, accepting nothing from the Gentiles.
Therefore, we ought to support such people, so that we may be fellow workers for the truth.
I wrote to the church, but Diotrephes, who loves to be first among them, does not welcome us.
Therefore, if I come, I will bring up his deeds, which he does, prattling against us with malicious words. And not satisfied with this, he neither receives the brothers himself, nor does he allow those who would, to welcome them, and he expels them from the church.
Dear friend, do not imitate what is evil but what is good. The one who does good is of God; the one who does evil has not seen God.
Demetrius has received a good testimony from everyone, and from the truth itself; we also testify, and you know that our testimony is true.
I have much to say to you, but I do not wish to write to you with ink and pen.
But I hope to see you soon, and we will speak face to face.
Peace be with you. The friends greet you. Greet the friends by name.
Jude, a servant of Jesus Christ and brother of James, to those who are sanctified by God the Father and preserved in Jesus Christ, called.
Mercy, peace, and love be multiplied to you.
Dear friends, although I was very eager to write to you about the common salvation, I found it necessary to write to you, urging you to contend for the faith that was once for all entrusted to the saints.
For certain individuals have secretly slipped in among you—those who were long ago marked out for this condemnation—ungodly persons who turn the grace of our God into a license for immorality and deny our only Master and Lord, Jesus Christ.
Now I want to remind you, although you once fully knew it, that Jesus, who saved a people out of the land of Egypt, afterward destroyed those who did not believe.
And the angels who did not keep their own position of authority but abandoned their proper dwelling, He has kept in eternal chains under darkness for the judgment of the great day.
Just as Sodom and Gomorrah and the surrounding cities, having given themselves over to sexual immorality and pursued unnatural desires, serve as an example by undergoing a punishment of eternal fire.
In the same way, these individuals also dream about defiling the flesh, rejecting authority, and blaspheming glorious beings.
But Michael, the archangel, when he disputed with the devil and argued about the body of Moses, did not presume to pronounce a railing judgment against him, but said, 'The Lord rebuke you!'
But these men blaspheme what they do not understand; and what they instinctively know, like unreasoning animals, in these things they corrupt themselves.
Woe to them! For they have followed the way of Cain, and for pay they have rushed headlong into the error of Balaam, and in rebellion they perished like Korah.
These are the hidden reefs in your love feasts, shamelessly feasting with you, feeding only themselves; they are clouds without water, carried along by the winds; they are autumn trees without fruit, twice dead, uprooted.
They are wild waves of the sea, foaming up their own shame; wandering stars, for whom the blackness of darkness has been reserved forever.
And Enoch, the seventh from Adam, prophesied about these men, saying: "Behold, the Lord comes with thousands of His holy ones."
to execute judgment against all, and to convict all the ungodly of their deeds of ungodliness that they have committed in such an ungodly way, and of all the harsh things that ungodly sinners have spoken against Him.
These are grumblers and fault-finders, following their own desires; they speak arrogantly, flattering others to gain an advantage.
But you, beloved, remember the words spoken beforehand by the apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ.
For they said to you that in the last times there will be mockers who walk according to their own ungodly desires.
These are the ones who cause divisions; they are worldly, devoid of the Spirit.
But you, dear friends, build yourselves up in your most holy faith and pray in the Holy Spirit.
Keep yourselves in the love of God, eagerly awaiting the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ that leads to eternal life.
And have mercy on those who doubt;
Save others by snatching them from the fire; to others show mercy with fear, hating even the garment stained by the flesh.
To Him who is able to keep you from stumbling and to present you blameless before His glory with great joy.
To the only wise God our Savior, be glory, majesty, power, and authority, now and forever. Amen.
The Revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave him to show his servants what must soon take place. He made it known by sending his angel to his servant John.
who bore witness to the word of God and to the testimony of Jesus Christ, all that he saw.
Blessed is the one who reads aloud the words of this prophecy, and blessed are those who hear and take to heart what is written in it, for the time is near.
John, to the seven churches that are in Asia: Grace to you and peace from God, who is, and who was, and who is to come, and from the seven spirits who are before His throne.
and from Jesus Christ, the faithful witness, the firstborn from the dead, and the ruler of the kings of the earth. To Him who loves us and has freed us from our sins by His blood,
And He has made us a kingdom, priests to His God and Father; to Him be glory and dominion forever and ever. Amen.
Behold, He is coming with the clouds, and every eye will see Him, even those who pierced Him; and all the tribes of the earth will wail on account of Him. Yes, Amen.
I am the Alpha and the Omega, says the Lord God, who is and who was and who is to come, the Almighty.
I, John, your brother and partner in the tribulation and kingdom and endurance in Jesus, was on the island called Patmos because of the word of God and the testimony of Jesus Christ.
I was in the Spirit on the Lord's Day, and I heard behind me a loud voice like a trumpet.
saying, 'Write what you see in a book and send it to the seven churches, to Ephesus, to Smyrna, to Pergamum, to Thyatira, to Sardis, to Philadelphia, and to Laodicea.'
And I turned to see the voice that was speaking to me. And when I turned, I saw seven golden lampstands.
And in the midst of the seven lampstands, I saw one like a son of man, clothed in a long robe and with a golden sash wrapped around His chest.
His head and His hairs were white like wool, as white as snow; and His eyes were like a flame of fire.
And His feet were like fine brass, as if they had been refined in a furnace; and His voice was like the sound of many waters.
And He held seven stars in His right hand, and out of His mouth came a sharp, two-edged sword, and His countenance was like the sun shining in its strength.
And when I saw Him, I fell at His feet as though dead. But He laid His right hand upon me, saying, 'Do not be afraid; I am the First and the Last.'
And the Living One; I was dead, and behold, I am alive forevermore, and I hold the keys of death and Hades.
Write, therefore, what you have seen, what is now, and what will take place after this.
The mystery of the seven stars that you saw in My right hand, and the seven golden lampstands: the seven stars are the angels of the seven churches, and the seven lampstands are the seven churches.
To the angel of the church in Ephesus write: These are the words of Him who holds the seven stars in His right hand, who walks among the seven golden lampstands.
I know your works, your toil, and your perseverance, and that you cannot bear those who are evil. You have tested those who call themselves apostles and are not, and found them to be liars.
And you have persevered, and have endured for my name's sake, and have not grown weary.
But I have this against you, that you have forsaken your first love.
Therefore, remember from where you have fallen; repent, and do the works you did at first. If not, I will come to you soon and remove your lampstand from its place, unless you repent.
But this you have: that you hate the works of the Nicolaitans, which I also hate.
Let anyone who has an ear listen to what the Spirit says to the churches. To the one who conquers, I will grant to eat from the tree of life, which is in the paradise of my God.
And to the angel of the church in Smyrna write: These are the words of the First and the Last, who died and came to life.
I know your works, your tribulation, and your poverty; yet you are rich. I also know the slander of those who claim to be Jews but are not, for they are a synagogue of Satan.
Do not be afraid of what you are about to suffer. Behold, the devil is about to throw some of you into prison, that you may be tested, and for ten days you will have tribulation. Be faithful unto death, and I will give you the crown of life.
He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches. The one who conquers shall not be harmed by the second death.
And to the angel of the church in Pergamum write: 'These are the words of him who has the sharp, double-edged sword.'
I know your deeds and where you dwell, where Satan's throne is; yet you hold fast to my name and did not deny my faith, even in the days of Antipas, my faithful witness, who was killed among you, where Satan dwells.
But I have a few things against you, because you hold to the teaching of Balaam, who instructed Balak to put a stumbling block before the children of Israel, to eat things sacrificed to idols and to commit sexual immorality.
Thus you also have those who hold to the teaching of the Nicolaitans in the same way.
Therefore, repent; if not, I will come to you soon and wage war against them with the sword of my mouth.
He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches. To the one who conquers, I will give some of the hidden manna, and I will give him a white stone, and on the stone a new name written, which no one knows except the one who receives it.
And to the angel of the church in Thyatira write: 'These things says the Son of God, who has eyes like a flame of fire, and His feet are like fine bronze.'
I know your works, your love, your faith, your service, and your endurance; and that your latter works are greater than the first.
But I have a few things against you, that you tolerate that woman Jezebel, who calls herself a prophetess and is teaching and leading my servants astray to commit sexual immorality and to eat food sacrificed to idols.
And I gave her time to repent, but she refuses to repent of her sexual immorality.
Behold, I will throw her onto a bed of suffering, and those who commit adultery with her will suffer greatly, unless they repent of her deeds.
And I will strike her children dead. Then all the churches will know that I am He who searches the minds and hearts, and I will give to each of you according to your works.
But to you who are remaining in Thyatira, as many as do not hold to this teaching, who have not known the depths of Satan, as they say, I do not lay upon you any other burden.
But hold fast to what you have until I come.
And to the one who conquers and keeps My works until the end, I will give authority over the nations.
He will shepherd them with a rod of iron, as vessels of pottery are shattered, just as I received from My Father.
And I will give him the morning star.
He who has an ear, let him listen to what the Spirit says to the churches.
And to the angel of the church in Sardis write: These things says He who has the seven spirits of God and the seven stars: 'I know your works, that you have a name that you are alive, but you are dead.'
Be watchful, and strengthen the things which remain, that are ready to die; for I have not found your works perfect before my God.
Remember therefore how you have received and heard; hold fast and repent. If you will not watch, I will come upon you as a thief, and you will not know what hour I will come upon you.
Yet you have a few names in Sardis who have not defiled their garments; and they shall walk with Me in white, for they are worthy.
The one who conquers will be clothed in white garments; I will never erase his name from the Book of Life, but will confess his name before My Father and before His angels.
He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches.
And to the angel of the church in Philadelphia write: ‘These are the words of the Holy One, the True One, who holds the key of David, who opens and no one will shut, who shuts and no one opens.’
I know your deeds; behold, I have set before you an open door, which no one is able to shut; because you have a little power, and have kept My word, and have not denied My name.
Behold, I will make those from the synagogue of Satan, who claim to be Jews but are not, for they lie—behold, I will cause them to come and worship before your feet, and they will know that I have loved you.
Because you have kept My command to persevere, I also will keep you from the hour of trial which shall come upon the whole world, to test those who dwell on the earth.
I am coming soon; hold fast to what you have, so that no one may take your crown.
The one who conquers, I will make him a pillar in the temple of my God, and he shall never go out from it anymore. And I will write on him the name of my God, and the name of the city of my God, the new Jerusalem, which descends from my God out of heaven, and my new name.
Let the one who has an ear listen to what the Spirit says to the churches.
And to the angel of the church in Laodicea write: 'These things says the Amen, the faithful and true witness, the beginning of the creation of God:'
I know your works, that you are neither cold nor hot. I wish you were cold or hot.
So then, because you are lukewarm, neither hot nor cold, I am about to spew you out of my mouth.
For you say, ‘I am rich, and have become wealthy, and have need of nothing,’ but you do not know that you are wretched, miserable, poor, blind, and naked.
I counsel you to buy from me gold refined by fire, so that you may be rich; and white garments so that you may clothe yourself and the shame of your nakedness may not be seen; and salve to anoint your eyes, so that you may see.
As many as I love, I rebuke and discipline; therefore be zealous and repent.
Behold, I stand at the door and knock. If anyone hears My voice and opens the door, I will come in to him and dine with him, and he with Me.
To the one who conquers, I will grant him to sit with Me on My throne, as I also conquered and sat down with My Father on His throne.
Let the one who has an ear listen to what the Spirit says to the churches.
After this, I looked, and behold, a door was opened in heaven. And the first voice I heard, like a trumpet speaking to me, said, 'Come up here, and I will show you what must take place after this.'
And immediately I was in the Spirit; and behold, a throne stood in heaven, and One was seated on the throne.
And He who sat there appeared like a jasper stone and a sardius in appearance; and there was a rainbow around the throne, resembling an emerald in its brilliance.
Surrounding the throne were twenty-four other thrones, and seated on these thrones were twenty-four elders, dressed in white robes, with golden crowns upon their heads.
And from the throne came flashes of lightning, voices, and thunder; and there were seven torches of fire burning before the throne, which are the seven Spirits of God.
And before the throne there was a sea of glass, like crystal; and in the midst of the throne and around the throne were four living creatures full of eyes in front and in back.
The first living creature was like a lion, the second living creature was like an ox, the third living creature had a face like a man, and the fourth living creature was like a flying eagle.
And the four living creatures, each one of them having six wings, were full of eyes all around and within. They do not rest day or night, saying: 'Holy, holy, holy is the Lord God Almighty, who was and is and is to come!'
And whenever the living creatures give glory and honor and thanks to the One seated on the throne, to the One who lives forever and ever,
The twenty-four elders will fall down before the One seated on the throne and will worship the One who lives forever and ever, and they will cast their crowns before the throne, saying:
Worthy are You, O Lord and God of ours, to receive glory and honor and power; for You created all things, and by Your will they existed and were created.
And I saw in the right hand of Him who sat on the throne a scroll written inside and on the back, sealed with seven seals.
And I saw a mighty angel proclaiming with a loud voice, 'Who is worthy to open the scroll and break its seals?'
And no one in heaven, nor on the earth, nor under the earth was able to open the scroll or even to look at it.
And I began to weep bitterly, because no one was found worthy to open the scroll or to look into it.
And one of the elders said to me, 'Do not weep; behold, the Lion of the tribe of Judah, the Root of David, has prevailed to open the scroll and its seven seals.'
And I looked, and behold, in the midst of the throne and of the four living creatures, and in the midst of the elders, stood a Lamb as though it had been slain, having seven horns and seven eyes, which are the seven spirits of God sent out into all the earth.
And He came and took the scroll out of the right hand of Him who sat on the throne.
And when He had taken the scroll, the four living creatures and the twenty-four elders fell down before the Lamb, each holding a harp and golden bowls full of incense, which are the prayers of the saints.
And they sang a new song, saying: "Worthy are You to take the scroll and to open its seals, for You were slain and by Your blood You ransomed people for God from every tribe and language and people and nation.
And You have made them to be a kingdom and priests to our God; and they shall reign upon the earth.
And I looked and heard the voice of many angels surrounding the throne, and the living creatures and the elders; their number was myriads of myriads and thousands of thousands.
saying with a loud voice, 'Worthy is the Lamb who was slain to receive power and riches and wisdom and strength and honor and glory and blessing!'
And I heard every creature in heaven and on earth and under the earth and in the sea, and all that is in them, saying: 'To the one who sits on the throne and to the Lamb belong blessing and honor and glory and power forever and ever.'
And the four living creatures said, 'Amen!' And the elders fell down and worshiped.
And I watched as the Lamb opened one of the seven seals; and I heard one of the four living creatures saying, with a voice like thunder, 'Come!'
And I looked, and behold, a white horse! The one sitting on it had a bow, and a crown was given to him. He went out conquering and to conquer.
And when He opened the second seal, I heard the second living creature say, 'Come forth!'
And another horse came forth, fiery red, and to him who sat upon it was given the authority to take peace from the earth, causing men to slay one another. And a great sword was given to him.
And when He opened the third seal, I heard the third living creature say, 'Come!' And I looked, and behold, a black horse, and he who sat on it had a pair of scales in his hand.
And I heard a voice in the midst of the four living creatures saying, 'A measure of wheat for a denarius, and three measures of barley for a denarius; but do not harm the oil and the wine.'
And when He opened the fourth seal, I heard the voice of the fourth living creature saying, 'Come forth.'
And I looked, and behold, a pale horse, and its rider's name was Death, and Hades followed him. Authority was given to them over a fourth of the earth, to kill by the sword, by famine, by pestilence, and by the wild beasts of the earth.
And when he opened the fifth seal, I saw underneath the altar the souls of those who had been slain for the word of God and for the testimony they bore.
And they cried out with a loud voice, saying, ‘How long, O Sovereign Lord, holy and true, until You judge and avenge our blood on those who dwell on the earth?’
And a white robe was given to each of them, and they were told to rest a little longer, until the full number of their fellow servants and brothers should be completed, who were to be killed as they themselves had been.
And I watched as He opened the sixth seal, and a great earthquake occurred; and the sun turned as black as sackcloth made of goat hair, and the whole moon became like blood.
And the stars of heaven fell to the earth, like a fig tree dropping its unripe figs when shaken by a strong wind.
And the sky receded like a scroll being rolled up, and every mountain and island was removed from its place.
And the kings of the earth, the great ones, the commanders, the wealthy, the mighty, and every slave and free person hid themselves in the caves and among the rocks of the mountains.
And they cried out to the mountains and the rocks, 'Fall upon us and hide us from the face of Him who is seated on the throne and from the wrath of the Lamb.'
For the great day of His wrath has come, and who is able to stand?
After this, I saw four angels standing at the four corners of the earth, holding back the four winds of the earth, so that no wind would blow on the earth or on the sea or upon any tree.
And I saw another angel ascending from the east, having the seal of the living God; and he cried out with a loud voice to the four angels to whom it was granted to harm the earth and the sea.
saying, 'Do not harm the earth, the sea, or the trees, until we have sealed the servants of our God on their foreheads.'
And I heard the number of those who were sealed: one hundred forty-four thousand sealed from every tribe of the sons of Israel.
From the tribe of Judah twelve thousand were sealed, from the tribe of Reuben twelve thousand, from the tribe of Gad twelve thousand.
From the tribe of Asher twelve thousand were sealed, from the tribe of Naphtali twelve thousand, from the tribe of Manasseh twelve thousand.
From the tribe of Simeon, twelve thousand were sealed; from the tribe of Levi, twelve thousand; from the tribe of Issachar, twelve thousand.
From the tribe of Zebulun, twelve thousand were sealed; from the tribe of Joseph, twelve thousand; from the tribe of Benjamin, twelve thousand were sealed.
After this I looked, and behold, a great multitude that no one could number, from every nation and all tribes and peoples and languages, standing before the throne and before the Lamb, clothed in white robes, with palm branches in their hands.
And they cried out with a loud voice, saying, 'Salvation belongs to our God who sits upon the throne, and to the Lamb!'
And all the angels stood in a circle around the throne, and the elders, and the four living creatures, and they fell before the throne on their faces and worshiped God.
saying: "Amen! Blessing and glory and wisdom and thanksgiving and honor and power and might belong to our God forever and ever! Amen."
Then one of the elders addressed me, saying, 'These who are clothed in white robes—who are they, and where have they come from?'
And I said to him, 'My lord, you know.' And he said to me, 'These are the ones coming out of the great tribulation; they have washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb.'
Therefore, they are before the throne of God and serve Him day and night in His temple. And He who sits on the throne will shelter them with His presence.
They will no longer experience hunger or thirst, and the sun will not strike them, nor will any scorching heat.
For the Lamb at the center of the throne will shepherd them and lead them to the springs of the waters of life, and God will wipe away every tear from their eyes.
And when He opened the seventh seal, there was silence in heaven for about half an hour.
And I saw the seven angels who stood before God, and to them were given seven trumpets.
And another angel came and stood at the altar, holding a golden censer; and he was given much incense to offer, with the prayers of all the saints, upon the golden altar before the throne.
And the smoke of the incense, along with the prayers of the saints, ascended from the angel's hand before God.
And the angel took the censer, filled it with fire from the altar, and hurled it to the earth. And there were voices, thunderings, lightnings, and an earthquake.
And the seven angels who held the seven trumpets prepared themselves to sound.
And the first angel sounded his trumpet, and there came hail and fire mixed with blood, and it was hurled down upon the earth; and a third of the earth was burned up, and a third of the trees were burned up, and all the green grass was burned up.
And the second angel sounded his trumpet, and something like a great mountain burning with fire was thrown into the sea; and a third of the sea became blood.
And a third of the living creatures in the sea died, and a third of the ships were destroyed.
And the third angel sounded his trumpet, and a great star fell from heaven, burning like a lamp, and it fell upon a third of the rivers and upon the springs of water.
And the name of the star is called Wormwood. And a third of the waters became bitter, and many people died from the waters because they were made bitter.
And the fourth angel sounded his trumpet, and a third of the sun was struck, and a third of the moon, and a third of the stars, so that a third of them was darkened, and the day did not shine for a third of it, and likewise the night.
And I looked, and I heard one eagle flying in midheaven, saying with a loud voice, "Woe, woe, woe to those who dwell on the earth, because of the remaining blasts of the trumpets of the three angels who are about to sound!"
And the fifth angel sounded his trumpet; and I saw a star that had fallen from heaven to the earth, and to him was given the key to the abyss.
And he opened the pit of the abyss, and smoke arose from the pit like the smoke of a burning furnace; and the sun and the air were darkened because of the smoke from the pit.
And from the smoke came forth locusts upon the earth, and they were given authority like the authority that scorpions have on the earth.
And they were told not to harm the grass of the earth, nor any green thing, nor any tree, but only those people who do not have the seal of God on their foreheads.
And they were given authority not to kill them, but to torment them for five months; and their torment was like the torment of a scorpion when it strikes a man.
In those days, people will seek death and will not find it; they will long to die, but death will flee from them.
And the shapes of the locusts were like horses prepared for battle, and on their heads were crowns resembling gold, and their faces were like the faces of men.
They had hair like the hair of women, and their teeth were like those of lions.
They had breastplates that looked like iron, and the sound of their wings was like the noise of many chariots with horses rushing into battle.
And they had tails like scorpions, with stingers, and in their tails they had the power to harm men for five months.
They have as their king the angel of the abyss; his name in Hebrew is Abaddon, and in Greek he has the name Apollyon.
The first woe has passed; behold, two more woes are coming after this.
Then the sixth angel sounded his trumpet; and I heard a voice coming from the four horns of the golden altar that is before God.
saying to the sixth angel, the one who had the trumpet, 'Release the four angels who are bound at the great river Euphrates.'
So the four angels, who had been prepared for the exact hour, day, month, and year, were released to kill a third of mankind.
And the number of the armies of the horsemen was two hundred million; I heard their number.
Thus I saw the horses in the vision, and those who sat on them had breastplates of fiery red, hyacinth blue, and sulfur yellow; and the heads of the horses were like the heads of lions. From their mouths came fire and smoke and brimstone.
By these three plagues, a third of mankind was killed: by the fire, the smoke, and the sulfur that came out of their mouths.
For the power of the horses is in their mouths and in their tails; for their tails are like serpents, having heads, and with them they inflict harm.
And the rest of mankind, who were not killed by these plagues, did not repent of the works of their hands, nor give up worshiping demons and idols of gold, silver, bronze, stone, and wood, which cannot see or hear or walk.
And they did not repent of their murders, nor of their sorceries, nor of their sexual immorality, nor of their thefts.
And I saw another strong angel descending from heaven, wrapped in a cloud, and a rainbow was upon his head; his face shone like the sun, and his feet were like pillars of fire.
And he had in his hand an open scroll. He set his right foot upon the sea, and his left foot upon the land.
And he cried out with a loud voice, like a lion roaring. And when he cried out, the seven thunders uttered their voices.
And when the seven thunders had spoken, I was about to write; but I heard a voice from heaven saying, 'Seal up what the seven thunders have said, and do not write it down.'
And the angel whom I saw standing on the sea and on the land raised his right hand to heaven.
And he swore by the One who lives forever and ever, who created the heavens and all that is in them, and the earth and all that is upon it, and the sea and all that is in it, saying, "There will be no more delay."
But in the days of the voice of the seventh angel, when he is about to sound his trumpet, the mystery of God will be fulfilled, just as He declared to His servants the prophets.
And the voice that I heard from heaven spoke again with me, saying, ‘Go, take the little scroll that is open in the hand of the angel standing on the sea and on the land.’
So I went to the angel and said to him, ‘Give me the little scroll.’ And he said to me, ‘Take it and eat it; it will make your stomach bitter, but in your mouth it will be as sweet as honey.'
And I took the scroll from the angel's hand and ate it; it was as sweet as honey in my mouth, but when I had eaten it, my stomach became bitter.
And they said to me, 'You must prophesy again concerning many peoples and nations and languages and kings.'
And a measuring rod like a staff was given to me, saying, 'Rise and measure the temple of God, the altar, and those who worship there.'
But exclude the outer court of the temple; do not measure it, for it has been given over to the nations, and they will trample the holy city for forty-two months.
And I will give authority to my two witnesses, and they will prophesy for one thousand two hundred sixty days, clothed in sackcloth.
These are the two olive trees and the two lampstands that stand before the Lord of the earth.
And if anyone seeks to harm them, fire comes forth from their mouths and consumes their enemies; and if anyone would harm them, thus must he be killed.
These two witnesses have the authority to shut the sky, so that no rain falls during the days of their prophecy; and they have authority over the waters to turn them into blood, and to strike the earth with every kind of plague as often as they desire.
And when they have completed their testimony, the beast that rises from the abyss will make war on them and conquer them, and kill them.
And their dead bodies will lie in the street of the great city, which is symbolically called Sodom and Egypt, where also their Lord was crucified.
And people from the nations and tribes and tongues and peoples will gaze at their lifeless bodies for three and a half days, and they will not permit their corpses to be laid in a tomb.
And those who dwell on the earth will rejoice over them and be glad, and they will send gifts to one another, because these two prophets had tormented those who dwell on the earth.
But after three and a half days, the breath of life from God entered them, and they stood on their feet; and great fear fell upon those who saw them.
And I heard a loud voice from heaven saying to them, 'Come up here.' And they ascended to heaven in a cloud, while their enemies watched them.
And in that day, a great earthquake occurred, and a tenth of the city fell, and seven thousand names of men were killed in the earthquake; and the rest were terrified and gave glory to the God of heaven.
The second woe has passed; behold, the third woe is coming swiftly.
And the seventh angel sounded the trumpet; and there were loud voices in heaven saying: 'The kingdom of this world has become the kingdom of our Lord and of His Christ, and He shall reign forever and ever!'
And the twenty-four elders who sit before God on their thrones fell on their faces and worshiped God.
saying, ‘We give thanks to You, Lord God Almighty, who is and who was, for You have taken Your great power and begun to reign.’
And the nations were enraged, and Your wrath has come, and the time has come for the nations to be judged, and to give reward to Your servants the prophets and to the saints, to those who fear Your name, both small and great, and to destroy those who destroy the earth.
Then the temple of God in heaven was opened, and the Ark of His Covenant was seen within His temple; and there were flashes of lightning, voices, thunders, an earthquake, and great hail.
And a great sign appeared in heaven: a woman clothed with the sun, and the moon under her feet, and on her head a crown of twelve stars.
And she was pregnant, crying out in the throes of childbirth and in great distress to give birth.
And another sign appeared in heaven: behold, a great red dragon, having seven heads and ten horns, and on his heads seven diadems.
And his tail swept away a third of the stars of heaven, and he hurled them to the earth. The dragon stood in front of the woman who was about to give birth, so that when she bore her child, he might devour it.
And she bore a son, a male child, who is to rule all the nations with a rod of iron; and her child was caught up to God and to His throne.
And the woman fled into the wilderness, where she has a place prepared by God, that they should nourish her there for one thousand two hundred sixty days.
And war broke out in heaven; Michael and his angels fought against the dragon, and the dragon and his angels fought back.
And he could not prevail, nor was there any place found for him in heaven any longer.
And the dragon was cast down, that ancient serpent, who is called the Devil and Satan, the one deceiving the whole world; he was thrown down to the earth, and his angels were cast out with him.
And I heard a loud voice in heaven proclaiming, 'Now has come the salvation and the power and the kingdom of our God, and the authority of His Christ; for the accuser of our brothers has been cast down, who accuses them before our God day and night.'
And they triumphed over him by the blood of the Lamb and by the word of their testimony; they did not love their lives so much as to shrink from death.
Therefore, rejoice, you heavens, and all who dwell in them! Woe to the earth and the sea, for the devil has come down to you with great wrath, knowing that he has but a short time."
And when the dragon saw that he had been thrown down to the earth, he pursued the woman who had given birth to the male child.
And to the woman were given two wings of the great eagle, that she might fly into the wilderness, to her place, where she is nourished for a time, times, and half a time, from the face of the serpent.
And the serpent poured out from his mouth water like a river after the woman, so that he might sweep her away with the flood.
But the earth helped the woman, and the earth opened its mouth and swallowed the river that the dragon had poured out from his mouth.
And the dragon became enraged with the woman and went off to make war against the rest of her offspring, those who keep the commandments of God and hold to the testimony of Jesus.

And I stood upon the sand of the sea, and I saw a beast rising up out of the sea, having ten horns and seven heads, and upon his horns ten crowns, and upon his heads the names of blasphemy.
And the beast that I saw was like a leopard, its feet were like those of a bear, and its mouth was like the mouth of a lion. The dragon gave it his power, his throne, and great authority.
One of its heads seemed to be wounded fatally, but its deadly wound was healed. And the whole earth marveled and followed the beast.
And they worshiped the dragon who gave authority to the beast; and they worshiped the beast, saying, 'Who is like the beast? Who is able to make war against it?'
And there was given to him a mouth speaking great things and blasphemies; and authority was given to him to continue for forty-two months.
And he opened his mouth to speak blasphemies against God, to blaspheme His name and His dwelling, those who dwell in heaven.
And it was granted to him to make war with the saints and to overcome them, and authority was given to him over every tribe and people and language and nation.
And all who dwell on the earth will worship him, whose names have not been written in the Book of Life of the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world.
If anyone has an ear, let him hear!
If anyone is destined for captivity, to captivity he goes; if anyone kills with the sword, by the sword he must be killed. Here is the perseverance and faith of the saints.
Then I saw another beast rising out of the earth. It had two horns like a lamb, but it spoke like a dragon.
And it exercises all the authority of the first beast in its presence. And it makes the earth and those who dwell in it worship the first beast, whose deadly wound was healed.
And it performs great signs, making fire come down from heaven to earth in the sight of people.
And he deceives those who dwell on the earth through the signs that were given to him to perform in the presence of the beast, telling those who dwell on the earth to make an image for the beast, who had the wound by the sword and lived.
And it was granted to him to give breath to the image of the beast, so that the image of the beast might speak and cause those who would not worship the image of the beast to be killed.
And he causes all, both small and great, both rich and poor, both free and slave, to be given a mark on their right hand or on their foreheads.
so that no one could buy or sell unless he had the mark, the name of the beast, or the number of its name.
This calls for wisdom: Let the one who has understanding calculate the number of the beast, for it is the number of a man. And his number is six hundred sixty-six.
Then I looked, and behold, the Lamb stood on Mount Zion, and with Him one hundred forty-four thousand who had His name and the name of His Father written on their foreheads.
And I heard a voice from heaven like the sound of many waters and like the voice of great thunder. And the voice I heard was like that of harpists playing on their harps.
And they sing a new song before the throne and before the four living creatures and the elders; and no one could learn that song except the one hundred and forty-four thousand who were redeemed from the earth.
These are the ones who have not been defiled with women, for they are pure; they follow the Lamb wherever He goes. These have been redeemed from among men, the firstfruits to God and to the Lamb.
And no lie was found in their mouths; for they are without blemish.
And I saw another angel flying in midair, having the eternal gospel to proclaim to those who dwell on the earth, to every nation, tribe, language, and people.
saying with a loud voice, 'Fear God and give Him glory, for the hour of His judgment has come; and worship Him who made the heaven, the earth, the sea, and the springs of water.'
And another angel, a second, followed, saying, 'Fallen, fallen is Babylon the great, she who has made all nations drink of the wine of the fury of her sexual immorality.'
And another angel, a third, followed them, saying with a loud voice, ‘If anyone worships the beast and its image, and receives its mark on his forehead or on his hand...'
He will also drink from the wine of God's fury, poured full strength into the cup of His wrath, and he will be tormented with fire and sulfur in the presence of the holy angels and in the presence of the Lamb.
And the smoke of their torment ascends forever and ever; they have no rest, day or night, who worship the beast and his image, and whoever receives the mark of his name.
Here is the steadfastness of the saints; those who keep the commandments of God and hold fast to the faith of Jesus.
And I heard a voice from heaven saying, "Write this: Blessed are the dead who die in the Lord from now on." "Yes," says the Spirit, "that they may rest from their labors, for their deeds follow them."
And I looked, and behold, a white cloud, and seated on the cloud was one like a son of man, having a golden crown on His head, and in His hand a sharp sickle.
And another angel came out of the temple, crying out with a loud voice to Him who sat on the cloud, 'Send forth your sickle and reap, for the hour to reap has come, for the harvest of the earth is ripe.'
So He who sat upon the cloud swung His sickle over the earth, and the earth was harvested.
And another angel came forth from the temple that is in heaven, also having a sharp sickle.
And another angel came out from the altar, having authority over the fire, and cried out with a loud voice to the one who had the sharp sickle, saying: ‘Send forth your sharp sickle and gather the clusters of grapes from the vine of the earth, for its grapes are ripe.’
And the angel swung his sickle over the earth, and gathered the grapes of the vine of the earth, and threw them into the winepress of the wrath of God, which was great.
And the winepress was trampled outside the city, and blood flowed from the winepress up to the bridles of the horses for a distance of one thousand six hundred stadia.
And I saw another great and marvelous sign in heaven: seven angels holding the seven last plagues, for with them the wrath of God is completed.
And I saw something like a sea of glass mixed with fire, and those who had overcome the beast, his image, and the number of his name standing on the sea of glass, holding the harps of God.
And they sang the song of Moses, the servant of God, and the song of the Lamb, saying: "Great and marvelous are Your works, O Lord God Almighty; just and true are Your ways, O King of the nations."
Who will not fear You, Lord, and glorify Your name? For You alone are holy; all nations will come and worship before You, for Your righteous acts have been revealed.
After this, I looked, and the temple of the tabernacle of testimony in heaven was opened.
And the seven angels came out of the temple, having the seven plagues, dressed in pure, shining linen, and girded about their chests with golden sashes.
And one of the four living creatures gave to the seven angels seven golden bowls, filled with the wrath of the living God, for the ages of ages.
And the temple was filled with smoke from the glory of God and from His power; and no one could enter the temple until the seven plagues of the seven angels were completed.
Then I heard a loud voice coming from the temple, saying to the seven angels, 'Go and pour out the seven bowls of God’s wrath upon the earth.'
And the first angel went and poured out his bowl upon the earth, and a foul and painful sore came upon the people who had the mark of the beast and who worshiped its image.
And the second angel poured out his bowl into the sea, and it became as blood, like that of a dead man; and every living soul in the sea perished.
And the third angel poured out his bowl into the rivers and the springs of water, and they became blood.
And I heard the angel of the waters saying, "You are righteous, O One who is and who was, the Holy One, for you have judged these things."
For they have shed the blood of saints and prophets, and You have given them blood to drink; they are worthy.
And I heard from the altar saying, 'Yes, Lord God Almighty, true and just are Your judgments.'
And the fourth angel poured out his bowl upon the sun; and it was given to him to scorch men with fire.
And the people were scorched by great heat, and they blasphemed the name of God who has authority over these plagues; and they did not repent to give Him glory.
And the fifth angel poured out his bowl upon the throne of the beast; and his kingdom was plunged into darkness, and they gnawed their tongues in agony.
And they blasphemed the God of heaven because of their pains and their sores, and they did not repent of their deeds.
And the sixth angel poured out his bowl upon the great river Euphrates, and its water was dried up, so that the way would be prepared for the kings from the east.
And I saw coming out of the mouth of the dragon, and out of the mouth of the beast, and out of the mouth of the false prophet, three unclean spirits like frogs.
For they are spirits of demons performing signs, which go out to the kings of the whole world, to gather them together for the battle of that great day of God Almighty.
Behold, I am coming like a thief. Blessed is the one who stays awake and keeps his garments, so that he may not walk naked and be seen exposed.
And they assembled them at the place called in Hebrew, Armageddon.
And the seventh angel poured out his bowl into the air; and a loud voice came out of the temple from the throne, saying, 'It is done!'
And there were flashes of lightning, and voices, and thunder; and a great earthquake occurred, such as had not been since mankind was upon the earth, so mighty was that earthquake.
And the great city was divided into three parts, and the cities of the nations fell. And Babylon the great was remembered before God, to give her the cup of the wine of the fury of His wrath.
And every island fled away, and the mountains were not found.
And great hail, as heavy as talents, fell from heaven upon men; and men blasphemed God because of the plague of the hail, for the plague was exceedingly great.
Then one of the seven angels who had the seven bowls came and spoke with me, saying, 'Come, I will show you the judgment of the great harlot who sits upon many waters.'
With whom the kings of the earth have committed fornication, and the inhabitants of the earth have been made drunk with the wine of her fornication.
And he carried me away in the Spirit into the wilderness. And I saw a woman sitting on a scarlet beast, full of names of blasphemy, having seven heads and ten horns.
And the woman was dressed in purple and scarlet, and adorned with gold and precious stones and pearls, holding a golden cup in her hand, full of abominations and the filthiness of her fornication.
And upon her forehead was written a name: Mystery, Babylon the Great, the Mother of Fornications and of the Abominations of the Earth.
And I saw the woman drunk with the blood of the saints and with the blood of the martyrs of Jesus. And when I saw her, I marveled with great astonishment.
And the angel said to me, "Why did you marvel? I will explain to you the mystery of the woman and of the beast that carries her, which has the seven heads and ten horns."
The beast that you saw was, and is not, and is about to ascend from the abyss and go to destruction. And those who dwell on the earth will marvel, whose names have not been written in the Book of Life from the foundation of the world, when they see the beast that was, and is not, and yet is.
This calls for a mind with wisdom: The seven heads are seven mountains upon which the woman sits.
And they are seven kings: five have fallen, one is, and the other has not yet come; and when he comes, he must remain for a little while.
And the beast that was, and is not, is himself the eighth, and is of the seven, and goes to destruction.
And the ten horns that you saw are ten kings who have not yet received a kingdom, but they will receive authority as kings for one hour, along with the beast.
These have one purpose, and they give their power and authority to the beast.
These will wage war against the Lamb, and the Lamb will triumph over them, for He is Lord of lords and King of kings; and those who are with Him are called, chosen, and faithful.
And he said to me, 'The waters that you saw, where the harlot sits, are peoples and multitudes and nations and languages.'
And the ten horns that you saw, along with the beast, will hate the harlot; they will make her desolate and naked, and they will devour her flesh and burn her up with fire.
For God has put it into their hearts to fulfill His purpose, to be of one mind and to give their kingdom to the beast, until the words of God are fulfilled.
And the woman whom you saw is the great city that reigns over the kings of the earth.
After these things, I saw another angel descending from heaven, having great authority, and the earth was illuminated by his glory.
And he cried out with a mighty voice, saying: "Fallen, fallen is Babylon the great! It has become a dwelling place for demons and a haunt for every unclean spirit, and a cage for every unclean and hated bird."
For all nations have drunk from the wine of the wrath of her fornication, and the kings of the earth have committed acts of immorality with her, and the merchants of the earth have grown rich through the abundance of her luxury.
And I heard another voice from heaven saying, 'Come out of her, My people, so that you do not share in her sins and so that you do not receive of her plagues.'
For her sins have piled up to heaven, and God has remembered her iniquities.
Render to her as she has rendered to you; and repay her double according to her works; in the cup which she mixed, mix double for her.
As much as she glorified herself and indulged in luxury, so much torment and grief give her. For she says in her heart, ‘I sit as a queen; I am not a widow, and I will never mourn.’
Therefore, in one day her plagues will come: death, mourning, and famine; and she will be utterly burned with fire, for the Lord God who judges her is mighty.
And the kings of the earth who committed fornication and lived luxuriously with her will weep and lament for her when they see the smoke of her burning.
Standing far off because of the fear of her torment, they cried out, ‘Alas, alas, the great city, Babylon, the mighty city! For in one hour your judgment has come.’
And the merchants of the earth will weep and mourn for her, for no one buys their cargo anymore.
cargo of gold, and silver, and precious stones, and pearls, and fine linen, and purple, and silk, and scarlet, and every kind of fragrant wood, and every vessel made of the most exquisite wood, and of bronze, and iron, and marble,
and cinnamon, and incense, and fragrant oils, and wine, and olive oil, and fine flour, and wheat, and cattle, and sheep, and horses, and chariots, and bodies, and souls of men.
And the fruit of your soul’s desire has vanished from you; and all the luxuries and splendors have departed from you, and you will never find them again.
The merchants of these things, who grew wealthy from her, will stand at a distance, fearful of her torment, weeping and mourning.
saying, 'Woe, woe, the great city, clothed in fine linen and purple and scarlet, adorned with gold and precious stones and pearls; for in one hour such great wealth has been laid waste!'
For in one hour such great riches have come to ruin! And every shipmaster, and all who navigate the sea, and sailors, and all who work the sea, stood far off.
And they cried out as they saw the smoke of her burning, saying, 'What city is like this great city?'
And they threw dust upon their heads and cried out, weeping and lamenting, saying: 'Woe, woe, the great city, in which all who had ships at sea grew rich from her wealth! For in one hour she has been laid waste.'
Rejoice over her, O heaven, and you saints and apostles and prophets, for God has judged your case against her.
And a mighty angel took up a stone like a great millstone and threw it into the sea, saying, 'Thus will Babylon the great city be thrown down with violence, and it will be found no more.'
And the sound of harpists, musicians, flutists, and trumpeters shall be heard no more in you; and no craftsman of any craft shall be found in you any longer; and the sound of the mill shall be heard no more in you.
And the light of the lamp shall shine in you no longer, and the voice of the bridegroom and bride shall be heard in you no longer; for your merchants were the great ones of the earth, and by your sorcery all nations were deceived.
And in her was found the blood of prophets and saints, and of all who had been slain on the earth.
After this, I heard what sounded like the roar of a great multitude in heaven, shouting: "Hallelujah! Salvation and glory and power belong to our God!"
For true and just are His judgments; for He has judged the great harlot who corrupted the earth with her immorality, and He has avenged the blood of His servants at her hand.
And again they said, 'Hallelujah!' And her smoke rises up forever and ever.'
And the twenty-four elders and the four living creatures fell down and worshiped God who sits on the throne, saying, 'Amen! Hallelujah!'
And a voice came from the throne, saying: 'Praise our God, all you His servants, and you who fear Him, both small and great!'
And I heard what seemed to be the voice of a great multitude, like the sound of many waters and like the sound of mighty thunder, crying out: 'Hallelujah! For the Lord our God, the Almighty, reigns!'
Let us rejoice and be glad and give glory to Him, for the marriage of the Lamb has come, and His bride has made herself ready.
And it was granted to her to be clothed in fine linen, bright and clean; for the fine linen is the righteous acts of the saints.
Then he said to me, "Write this: Blessed are those who are called to the wedding supper of the Lamb." And he added, "These are the true words of God."
And I fell at his feet to worship him. But he said to me, "See that you do not do that! I am your fellow servant and of your brothers who hold to the testimony of Jesus. Worship God! For the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy."
And I saw heaven opened, and behold, a white horse! The one sitting on it is called Faithful and True, and in righteousness he judges and makes war.
His eyes were like flames of fire, and on His head were many crowns; He had a name written that no one knew except Himself.
He was clothed in a robe dipped in blood, and His name is called The Word of God.
And the armies in heaven followed Him on white horses, clothed in fine linen, white and clean.
And from His mouth comes a sharp sword, so that with it He may strike down the nations; and He will rule them with a rod of iron; and He treads the winepress of the fury of the wrath of God Almighty.
And He has a name written on His robe and on His thigh: King of kings and Lord of lords.
Then I saw an angel standing in the sun, and he cried out with a loud voice, saying to all the birds that fly in midheaven, 'Come, gather for the great supper of God,'
So that you may eat the flesh of kings, the flesh of captains, the flesh of mighty men, the flesh of horses and of those who sit upon them, and the flesh of all people, both free and slave, both small and great.
And I saw the beast, and the kings of the earth, and their armies gathered to wage war against Him who sat on the horse and against His army.
And the beast was captured, along with the false prophet who had performed signs in its presence, by which he deceived those who had received the mark of the beast and who worshiped its image; the two of them were thrown alive into the lake of fire that burns with sulfur.
And the rest were killed with the sword of the One sitting on the horse, the sword that came out of His mouth; and all the birds were filled with their flesh.
And I saw an angel coming down from heaven, holding the key to the abyss and a great chain in his hand.
And he seized the dragon, that ancient serpent, who is the Devil and Satan, the one who deceives the world; and he bound him for a thousand years.
And he threw him into the abyss, and shut it, and sealed it over him, so that he would no longer deceive the nations until the thousand years were completed; after these things he must be released for a little while.
And I saw thrones, and they sat upon them, and judgment was given to them. And the souls of those who had been beheaded for their testimony of Jesus and for the word of God, and who had not worshiped the beast or its image, and had not received its mark on their foreheads or their hands; and they lived and reigned with Christ for a thousand years.
And the rest of the dead did not come to life until the thousand years were completed. This is the first resurrection.
Blessed and holy is the one who has part in the first resurrection; over such, the second death has no power, but they shall be priests of God and of Christ, and shall reign with Him for a thousand years.
And when the thousand years are completed, Satan will be released from his prison.
And he will go out to deceive the nations that are in the four corners of the earth, Gog and Magog, to gather them for battle, whose number is like the sand of the sea.
And they ascended over the breadth of the earth, and surrounded the camp of the saints and the beloved city; but fire came down from God out of heaven and consumed them.
And the devil, who deceived them, was thrown into the lake of fire and brimstone, where the beast and the false prophet are; and they will be tormented day and night forever and ever.
And I saw a great white throne, and the One who sat upon it; from whose presence the earth and the sky fled away, and no place was found for them.
And I saw the dead, great and small, standing before the throne, and books were opened; and another book was opened, which is the Book of Life. The dead were judged according to what they had done as recorded in the books.
And the sea gave up the dead that were in it, and death and Hades surrendered the dead that were in them, and each was judged according to their deeds.
And death and Hades were thrown into the lake of fire. This is the second death.
And if anyone’s name was not found written in the book of life, he was thrown into the lake of fire.
And I saw a new heaven and a new earth; for the first heaven and the first earth had passed away, and the sea was no more.
And I saw the holy city, the new Jerusalem, descending from heaven, prepared by God, adorned as a bride beautifully dressed for her husband.
And I heard a loud voice from the throne saying, 'Look! The dwelling of God is with humanity. He will make His home with them, and they will be His people. God Himself will be with them and be their God.'
And God will wipe away every tear from their eyes, and there will be no more death, nor sorrow, nor crying, nor pain; for the former things have passed away.
And He who sits on the throne said, 'Behold, I am making all things new.' And He said to me, 'Write this down, for these words are faithful and true.'
And He said to me, 'It is accomplished! I am the Alpha and the Omega, the beginning and the end. To the one who is thirsty, I will freely give from the spring of the water of life.'
The one who conquers will inherit these things, and I will be his God, and he will be my son.
But as for the cowardly, the faithless, the detestable, the murderers, the sexually immoral, the sorcerers, the idolaters, and all liars, their place will be in the lake that burns with fire and sulfur, which is the second death.
Then one of the seven angels who had the seven bowls filled with the seven last plagues came and spoke to me, saying, 'Come, I will show you the Bride, the wife of the Lamb.'
And he carried me away in the Spirit to a great and high mountain, and showed me the holy city, Jerusalem, descending out of heaven from God.
Having the glory of God, its brilliance was like that of a precious stone, like a jasper, clear as crystal.
It had a great and high wall with twelve gates, and at the gates were twelve angels, and names inscribed, which are the names of the twelve tribes of the children of Israel.
There were three gates on the east, three gates on the north, three gates on the south, and three gates on the west.
And the wall of the city had twelve foundations, and on them were the names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb.
And the one speaking with me had a golden measuring rod to measure the city, its gates, and its wall.
The city lies square, its length equal to its width. He measured the city with the rod, and it measured twelve thousand stadia in length and in width and in height, it is equal.
And he measured its wall, one hundred forty-four cubits, according to the measure of a man, which is also that of an angel.
The structure of its wall was jasper, and the city was pure gold, like clear glass.
The foundations of the city's wall were adorned with every kind of precious stone: the first foundation was jasper, the second was sapphire, the third was chalcedony, and the fourth was emerald.
The fifth was sardonyx, the sixth was carnelian, the seventh was chrysolite, the eighth was beryl, the ninth was topaz, the tenth was chrysoprase, the eleventh was jacinth, and the twelfth was amethyst.
And the twelve gates were twelve pearls, each gate made from a single pearl. And the street of the city was pure gold, as transparent as glass.
And I saw no temple in it, for the Lord God Almighty and the Lamb are its temple.
And the city does not need the sun or the moon to shine on it, for the glory of God illuminates it, and its lamp is the Lamb.
And the nations shall walk by its light, and the kings of the earth shall bring their glory and honor into it.
And its gates shall never be shut by day, for there shall be no night there.
And they shall bring the glory and the honor of the nations into it.
And nothing unclean shall enter it, nor anyone who does what is detestable or false, but only those whose names are written in the Lamb's book of life.
And he showed me a river of the water of life, bright as crystal, flowing from the throne of God and of the Lamb.
In the midst of the city square and along the river, on both sides, was the tree of life, bearing twelve kinds of fruit, yielding its fruit each month; and the leaves of the tree were for the healing of the nations.
And there shall be no more curse; but the throne of God and of the Lamb shall be in it, and His servants shall serve Him.
And they shall see His face, and His name shall be on their foreheads.
And there will be no night there; they will not need the light of a lamp or the light of the sun, for the Lord God will shine upon them, and they will reign forever and ever.
And he said to me, 'These words are faithful and true. The Lord God, who inspires the spirits of the prophets, has sent His angel to show His servants what must soon take place.'
And behold, I am coming quickly. Blessed is he who keeps the words of the prophecy of this book.
I, John, the one who heard and saw these things, fell down to worship before the feet of the angel who showed them to me.
But he said to me, "Do not do that! I am your fellow servant, and of your brothers the prophets, and of those who keep the words of this book. Worship God!"
And he said to me, 'Do not seal the words of the prophecy of this book, for the time is at hand.'
Let the one who does wrong continue to do wrong, and let the filthy remain filthy; let the one who is righteous continue in righteousness, and let the holy remain holy.
Behold, I am coming quickly, and my reward is with me, to give to each one according to his work.
I am the Alpha and the Omega, the First and the Last, the Beginning and the End.
Blessed are those who do His commandments, that they may have the right to the tree of life and may enter through the gates into the city.
Outside are the dogs, the sorcerers, the sexually immoral, the murderers, the idolaters, and everyone who loves and commits falsehood.
I, Jesus, have sent my angel to testify to you about these things for the churches. I am the root and the offspring of David, the bright and morning star.
And the Spirit and the Bride say, 'Come!' And let the one who hears say, 'Come!' And let the one who is thirsty come; let the one who desires take the water of life freely.
I testify to everyone who hears the words of the prophecy of this book: if anyone adds to them, God will add to him the plagues that are written in this book.
And if anyone takes away from the words of the prophecy of this book, God will take away his share from the tree of life and from the holy city, which are described in this book.
He who testifies to these things says, 'Yes, I am coming quickly.' Amen! Come, Lord Jesus!
The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with all the saints. Amen.
