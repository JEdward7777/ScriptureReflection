I will outline these key points succinctly, ensuring to reflect the conservative Christian perspective while maintaining child-appropriate language.", "summary": "The peer review of JHN 3:36 highlights several important areas for improvement: 1. **Removal of Harsh Language**: A strong consensus exists on softening or removing phrases like 'God’s anger stays on them,' with suggestions for gentler alternatives, such as 'they won’t be part of God’s happy family' or 'God feels sad for them.' This is essential for making the text suitable for children. 2. **Fixing Content for Clarity**: Reviewers stress the importance of clearly communicating the seriousness of disbelief while maintaining a child-friendly tone. The translations should emphasize the weight of unbelief effectively. 3. **Age-Appropriate Language**: The language must remain simple and relatable, ensuring clear connections between belief in Jesus and the concept of being part of 'God’s happy family.' 4. **Adding Positive Aspects**: Some suggestions focus on enhancing the message regarding God's love and the wonderful gift of eternal life, but this is of lower priority. Overall, the translation aims to be accessible to young audiences while preserving theological integrity."}}]}
