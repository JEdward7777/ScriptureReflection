Working on verse LUK 1:9 which has grade 86.66666666666667

The peer reviews affirm that the translation of Luke 1:9 faithfully and conservatively captures the original Greek meaning and theological intent, highlighting the priestly custom and the allotment of incense burning duties. However, the specific phrase translating 'he was chosen by lot'—"چەك تاشلىغاندا شۇنداق بولدىكى، چەك ئۇنىڭغا چىقتى"—is consistently identified as awkward, unclear, and somewhat redundant in modern Uyghur. Reviewers recommend revising this phrase to a more natural, straightforward, and fluent expression that clearly conveys the idea of being allotted the duty by lot. This improvement will enhance readability and clarity for contemporary readers without compromising theological fidelity. Overall, the translation is accurate and doctrinally sound but would benefit from stylistic refinements to ensure smooth, natural, and accessible language.
