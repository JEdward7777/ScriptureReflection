**MAT 23:2**: _(Grade 75.8)_

**Source**:
> λέγων· ἐπὶ τῆς Μωσέως καθέδρας ἐκάθισαν οἱ γραμματεῖς καὶ οἱ Φαρισαῖοι. (saying: "The scribes and the Pharisees sit on Moses' seat.")

**Translation**:
> «¡Cualquiera que ve a estos escribas y fariseos creando leyes se creerá que son “Moisés en persona”! (Anyone who sees these scribes and Pharisees creating laws will think they are 'Moses in person'!)

**Combined Review**: The translation of MAT 23:2 shows a commendable effort to make the biblical text accessible for modern Spanish speakers. However, several reviewers expressed concerns that the phrase "creando leyes" (creating laws) may misrepresent the original Greek intent. The original text emphasizes the authority of the scribes and Pharisees sitting in Moses' seat rather than suggesting they are literally creating laws. A more precise translation could be more aligned with a conservative approach, maintaining the respect for scriptural authority and accurately reflecting Jesus' criticism of their hypocrisy. Suggestions include using a phrase such as "los escribas y fariseos han tomado asiento en la cátedra de Moisés" (the scribes and Pharisees have taken their seat in the chair of Moses), which would better capture the original message without introducing subjective interpretations. Overall, while the translation is engaging for a Latin American audience, it requires adjustments for clarity, accuracy, and theological precision.

**MAT 22:3**: _(Grade 78.3)_  

**Source**:  
> καὶ ἀπέστειλε τοὺς δούλους αὐτοῦ καλέσαι τοὺς κεκλημένους εἰς τοὺς γάμους, καὶ οὐκ ἤθελον ἐλθεῖν.  
(And he sent his servants to call those who were invited to the wedding, but they were not willing to come.)  

**Translation**:  
> Envió muchísimas invitaciones, y cuando el banquete estuvo listo, mandó un mensajero a notificar a los convidados que ya podían ir. ¡Pero nadie fue!  
(Sent many invitations, and when the banquet was ready, he sent a messenger to notify the guests that they could go. But no one went!)  

**Combined Review**: _(Grade 78.3)_  
The translation of MAT 22:3 attempts to make the text accessible for Spanish speakers in Latin America, but it faces several issues regarding fidelity to the original text. Phrases like "Envió muchísimas invitaciones" (Sent many invitations) imply a large number of invitations, which diverges from the singular invitation emphasized in the Greek text. Moreover, the use of "¡Pero nadie fue!" (But no one went!) simplifies the original message of indifference and could benefit from a more serious tone, such as "no quisieron venir" (they did not want to come). Overall, while the translation is clear and modern, it lacks precision in conveying the original intent of the scripture. Further adjustments are recommended to improve both accuracy and respect for the context of the parable.

**MAT 10:34**: _(Grade 79.2)_

**Source**:
> Μὴ νομίσητε ὅτι ἦλθον βαλεῖν εἰρήνην ἐπὶ τὴν γῆν· οὐκ ἦλθον βαλεῖν εἰρήνην, ἀλλὰ μάχαιραν. (Do not think that I have come to bring peace to the earth; I have not come to bring peace, but a sword.)

**Translation**:
> No crean que vine a traer paz a la tierra. ¡Vine a traer guerras!; (Do not think that I have come to bring peace to the earth. I have come to bring wars!);

**Combined Review**: The translation of MAT 10:34 captures the essence of the original text but contains some inaccuracies. While it reflects the provocative nature of Jesus' statement, the choice of the word 'guerras' (wars) could mislead readers into thinking of physical conflict rather than the metaphorical sense of division implied by the Greek term 'μάχαιραν' (sword). Multiple reviewers noted that terms like 'división' (division) or 'confrontación' (confrontation) would better align with the original intent. Additionally, the use of an exclamation point may exaggerate the tone of the original statement. Although the translation aims to be modern and accessible, greater fidelity to the theological meaning is crucial. The overall consensus is that while the translation is engaging, it requires adjustments for clarity and accuracy to truly reflect the message of Jesus.

**MAT 23:14**: _(Grade 79.2)_  

**Source**:  
> Οὐαὶ ὑμῖν, γραμματεῖς καὶ Φαρισαῖοι ὑποκριταί, ὅτι κλείετε τὴν βασιλείαν τῶν οὐρανῶν ἔμπροσθεν τῶν ἀνθρώπων· ὑμεῖς γὰρ οὐκ εἰσέρχεσθε, οὐδὲ τοὺς εἰσερχομένους ἀφίετε εἰσελθεῖν.  
  
**Translation**:  
> ¡Ay de ustedes, escribas y fariseos hipócritas, que por un lado hacen oraciones larguísimas en las calles y por el otro les roban las casas a las viudas! ¡Hipócritas!  
  
**Combined Review**:  
The translation of MAT 23:14 has been noted for its strengths and weaknesses. While it effectively captures the essence and condemnation of hypocrisy in Jesus's message, it introduces inaccuracies by including phrases not present in the original Greek. The expressions 'hacen oraciones larguísimas' (make very long prayers) and 'les roban las casas a las viudas' (they rob the houses of the widows) deviate from the original focus on closing the kingdom of heaven. This could mislead readers and detracts from the textual integrity that is important from a conservative Christian perspective. To improve accuracy, the translation should emphasize their role in hindering access to the kingdom rather than adding unrelated commentary. Overall, while the translation is modern and relatable, greater fidelity to the original scripture is necessary for clarity and authenticity.

**MAT 24:34**: _(Grade 79.2)_  

**Source**:  
> ἀμὴν λέγω ὑμῖν, οὐ μὴ παρέλθῃ ἡ γενεὰ αὕτη ἕως ἂν πάντα ταῦτα γένηται. (Amen, I say to you, this generation will not pass away until all these things take place.)  

**Translation**:  
> Sólo entonces terminará esta era de maldad. (Only then will this era of wickedness end.)  

**Review Summary**:  
The translation of MAT 24:34 as "Sólo entonces terminará esta era de maldad" captures the urgency and finality of Christ's statement, yet it diverges from the original Greek text, which emphasizes that 'this generation' will not pass away until all these events occur. Multiple reviews express that while the translation is clear and modern, it risks misrepresenting the intended meaning by interpreting 'era of wickedness' instead of 'generation'. To enhance accuracy, a recommended revision would be: "Esta generación no pasará hasta que todas estas cosas sucedan." (This generation will not pass away until all these things happen.) Overall, the translation is effective for a contemporary audience, but minor adjustments are necessary to ensure fidelity to the original scriptural intent.

**MAT 10:9**: _(Grade 80.8)_  

**Source**:  
> μὴ κτήσησθε χρυσὸν μηδὲ ἄργυρον μηδὲ χαλκὸν εἰς τὰς ζώνας ὑμῶν,  
*(Do not acquire gold, silver, or bronze for your belts)*  

**Translation**:  
> No lleven dinero *(Do not carry money)*  

**Combined Review**:  
The translation of Matthew 10:9 as "No lleven dinero" is clear and straightforward, effectively communicating the essential message of the original Greek. However, it lacks completeness by not capturing the full directive present in the Greek text, which specifically mentions not acquiring gold, silver, or bronze. This omission could lead to a less precise understanding of Jesus' instruction. Reviews suggest that a more comprehensive translation could enhance clarity and reflect the seriousness of the command, aligning closely with the intent of the original text. Suggestions for improvement include adding context regarding the types of currency and potentially adopting a tone that conveys the urgency and authority of the message. While the translation serves modern Spanish speakers well, enriching it with these details could provide a deeper understanding of the scripture.

**MAT 18:32**: _(Grade 81.7)_

**Source**:
> τότε προσκαλεσάμενος αὐτὸν ὁ κύριος αὐτοῦ λέγει αὐτῷ· δοῦλε πονηρέ, πᾶσαν τὴν ὀφειλὴν ἐκείνην ἀφῆκά σοι, ἐπεὶ παρεκάλεσάς με.  
(Then his lord called him and said to him, 'O wicked servant! I forgave you all that debt because you begged me.')

**Translation**:
> El rey, sin pérdida de tiempo, mandó llamar al hombre al que había perdonado. “¡Malvado! ¡Perverso!”, le dijo. “¡Así que yo te perdoné aquella inmensa deuda porque me lo pediste,  
(The king, without wasting time, summoned the man he had forgiven. 'Wicked! Perverse!' he said. 'So I forgave you that immense debt because you asked me.')

**Combined Review**: The translation of Matthew 18:32 generally captures the core message of the original text, effectively communicating the seriousness of the king's reprimand. However, the phrases "¡Malvado! ¡Perverso!" ("Wicked! Perverse!") might be perceived as overly dramatic or informal, which could undermine the reverence intended in this significant biblical lesson about mercy and forgiveness. A suggestion is to consider alternative phrasing such as "¡Malvado! ¡Desgraciado!" ("Wicked! Unfortunate!") to convey a stronger impact while maintaining the seriousness of the context. Additionally, the latter part of the translation could be improved by ensuring a more formal tone, specifically in the phrase "porque me lo pediste" ("because you asked me"), which may be too informal. Adjusting this could help maintain the gravity of the original scripture while still being accessible to a modern audience. Overall, the translation is clear and engaging, but minor adjustments in tone and word choice would enhance its suitability for a conservative interpretation of the text.

**MAT 23:5**: _(Grade 81.7)_

**Source**:
> πάντα δὲ τὰ ἔργα αὐτῶν ποιοῦσι πρὸς τὸ θεαθῆναι τοῖς ἀνθρώποις. πλατύνουσι γὰρ τὰ φυλακτήρια αὐτῶν καὶ μεγαλύνουσι τὰ κράσπεδα τῶν ἱματίων αὐτῶν,

**Translation**:
> »¡Y luego se dedican a hacer obras de caridad para que los demás los vean! Para aparentar santidad, se ponen en la frente y en los brazos porciones de las Escrituras escritas en las tiras de pergamino o piel más anchas que puedan encontrar, y procuran que los flecos de sus mantos sean más largos que los de los demás.

---

**Combined Review**: The translation of MAT 23:5 has received various critiques that highlight both its strengths and weaknesses. While the modern and accessible language resonates well with contemporary Spanish speakers, there are concerns about the tone and precision of certain phrases. The expression "obras de caridad" may not fully capture the intent of the original Greek term "ἔργα" (works), which encompasses a broader scope beyond charity. Additionally, the phrase "aparentar santidad" may dilute the serious nature of the hypocrisy being condemned. Critics suggest that more accurate alternatives, such as "buenas obras" or "actos de justicia," would align better with the text's theological intent. The description of wearing scriptural portions could also be clarified to enhance understanding, specifically referring to "escrituras en tiras de pergamino." Overall, the translation needs to strike a better balance between accessibility and fidelity to the original scripture to adequately reflect the gravity of Jesus' message.

**MAT 27:30**: _(Grade 81.7)_

**Source**:
> καὶ ἐμπτύσαντες εἰς αὐτὸν ἔλαβον τὸν κάλαμον καὶ ἔτυπτον εἰς τὴν κεφαλὴν αὐτοῦ.  
(*And they spat on him, and took the staff, and struck him on the head.*)

**Translation**:
> A veces lo escupían o le quitaban la vara y lo golpeaban con ella en la cabeza.  
(*Sometimes they spat on him or took the staff and struck him on the head.*)

**Combined Review** _(Grade 81.7)_: The translation of MAT 27:30 effectively conveys the essence of the original Greek text, successfully capturing the actions of the soldiers in their mockery and abuse of Jesus. However, the phrase 'A veces lo escupían' (*sometimes they spat on him*) could be perceived as downplaying the severity of the repeated actions. A more impactful translation might be 'Le escupieron' (*they spat on him*), which aligns more closely with the continuous brutality depicted in the scene. While the translation maintains clarity and accessibility for contemporary Spanish speakers, it could benefit from minor adjustments for greater emotional weight and fidelity to the original scripture. Overall, it is a commendable translation that meets the accessibility objective but requires refinement to fully resonate with the conservative Christian perspective.

**MAT 1:25**: _(Grade 83.3)_  

**Source**:  
> καὶ οὐκ ἐγίνωσκεν αὐτὴν ἕως οὗ ἔτεκε τὸν υἱὸν αὐτῆς τὸν πρωτότοκον, καὶ ἐκάλεσε τὸ ὄνομα αὐτοῦ Ἰησοῦν.  
  
**Translation**:  
> aunque no tuvo relaciones sexuales con ella hasta que nació su hijo. Cuando el niño nació, José lo llamó Jesús.  
  
### Combined Review  
The translation of MAT 1:25 successfully conveys the essential meaning of the original text, with clarity and accessibility for modern audiences. However, several reviews indicate that the phrase "no tuvo relaciones sexuales con ella" might be perceived as overly explicit in a conservative Christian context. A more respectful and euphemistic phrase such as "no la conoció" is suggested to maintain the reverence typically associated with biblical texts. Additionally, while the structure of the translation is clear, some reviewers recommend softening the language further, particularly in the second sentence, to better align with traditional interpretations. Overall, the translation is effective but could benefit from slight adjustments to enhance its sensitivity and appropriateness for a conservative audience.

**MAT 13:51**: _(Grade 83.3)_

**Source**:
> Λέγει αὐτοῖς ὁ Ἰησοῦς· συνήκατε ταῦτα πάντα; λέγουσιν αὐτῷ, ναί, Κύριε.
> (Jesus said to them, "Do you understand all these things?" They said to him, "Yes, Lord.")

**Translation**:
> ¿Entienden ahora?». (Do you understand now?)
> ―Sí —contestaron—. Gracias. (Yes, they answered—. Thank you.)

**Combined Review** _(Grade 85)_: The translation of MAT 13:51 successfully captures the essence of the original Greek text while using a modern, accessible style appropriate for Latin American Spanish speakers. However, the response 'Gracias' (Thank you) is seen as overly casual for a biblical context, detracting from the solemnity of the exchange. Several reviewers suggested a more formal acknowledgment, such as 'Sí, Señor' (Yes, Lord), to better align with the gravity of the dialogue between Jesus and his disciples. Overall, while the translation is effective in engaging the target audience, adjustments are needed for a more faithful representation of the original intent and reverence expected in biblical texts.

**MAT 15:15**: _(Grade 83.3)_  

**Source**:  
> ἀποκριθεὶς δὲ ὁ Πέτρος εἶπεν αὐτῷ· φράσον ἡμῖν τὴν παραβολὴν ταύτην. (And Peter answered and said to Him, "Explain this parable to us.")  

**Translation**:  
> Pedro le pidió que les explicara aquello de que comer los alimentos que la ley judía prohíbe no es lo que contamina al hombre. (Peter asked Him to explain what eating the foods that the Jewish law prohibits has to do with what contaminates a person.)  

### Combined Review Summary  
The translation of MAT 15:15 effectively communicates the essence of Peter's inquiry to Jesus, presenting it in a clear and modern style suitable for Latin American audiences. However, several reviews noted that the phrasing around contamination could potentially distract from the deeper spiritual message that Jesus conveyed regarding internal purity versus external observance of dietary laws.  

Reviewers suggested that the translation could be refined for greater accuracy, particularly to reflect that Peter's question is seeking clarification rather than emphasizing contamination due to dietary restrictions. Some recommended that the phrase about contamination be clarified to better connect with the surrounding verses, focusing more on the heart's intentions.  

Overall, while the translation is modern and engaging, it could benefit from a slight adjustment to enhance clarity and ensure fidelity to the original text's meaning.

**MAT 22:5**: _(Grade 83.3)_

**Source**:
> οἱ δὲ ἀμελήσαντες ἀπῆλθον, ὁ μὲν εἰς τὸν ἴδιον ἀγρόν, ὁ δὲ εἰς τὴν ἐμπορίαν αὐτοῦ; (But the ones who were careless went away, one to his own field, and another to his business.)

**Translation**:
> Algunos de los invitados se rieron de los mensajeros y se fueron a sus labranzas o negocios; (Some of the invited laughed at the messengers and went to their farming or business.)

**Combined Review**:  
The translation of MAT 22:5 generally conveys the essence of the original text, effectively capturing the dismissive attitude of the invited guests towards the king's invitation. However, it could benefit from improvements in clarity and word choice. 

Specifically, the phrase 'se rieron de los mensajeros' may not adequately reflect the degree of disregard present in the original Greek; a more precise term like 'despreciaron a los mensajeros' might communicate a stronger sense of disdain. The expression 'se fueron a sus labranzas o negocios' could also be made clearer by suggesting 'se fueron a trabajar en sus campos o a sus negocios'. Furthermore, using more common terminology such as 'trabajos' or 'actividades' in place of 'labranza' may enhance comprehension among various audiences. Overall, the translation is a commendable effort but requires adjustments to better convey the seriousness of the biblical message.

**MAT 22:11**: _(Grade 83.3)_

**Source**:
> εἰσελθὼν δὲ ὁ βασιλεὺς θεάσασθαι τοὺς ἀνακειμένους εἶδεν ἐκεῖ ἄνθρωπον οὐκ ἐνδεδυμένον ἔνδυμα γάμου,  
(When the king entered to see the guests, he saw there a man who was not dressed in wedding attire)

**Translation**:
> Pero cuando el rey fue a ver a los convidados, vio que uno no traía puesto el vestido de boda que había comprado para los invitados.  
(But when the king went to see the guests, he saw that one did not wear the wedding garment that he had bought for the guests.)

**Combined Review**: 
The translation of MAT 22:11 is generally clear and maintains the essence of the original text while using modern Spanish. However, the phrase 'que había comprado para los invitados' introduces an implication not found in the original Greek, suggesting that the man purchased the garment. This alteration could mislead readers regarding the significance of the wedding garment, which is typically understood as a requirement provided for the guests. A more faithful translation that directly reflects the nature of the garment and its theological importance would enhance accuracy and clarity. Overall, while the translation is accessible, it could be improved to align more closely with traditional interpretations, focusing on the necessity of wearing the proper attire rather than the implication of purchasing it.

**MAT 23:11**: _(Grade 83.3)_

**Source**:
> ὁ δὲ μείζων ὑμῶν ἔσται ὑμῶν διάκονος. (But the greatest among you shall be your servant.)

**Translation**:
> Mientras más humildemente sirvamos a los demás, más grandes seremos. Para ser grande hay que servir a los demás. (The more humbly we serve others, the greater we will be. To be great, one must serve others.)

**Combined Review** _(Grade 85)_: The translation of MAT 23:11 effectively captures the essence of the original Greek text, emphasizing humility and service in modern Spanish. However, the phrase 'Mientras más humildemente sirvamos a los demás, más grandes seremos. Para ser grande hay que servir a los demás,' while conveying the intended message, could be refined for clarity and formality. Suggestions for improvement include adopting a more direct representation of the original wording, such as 'El mayor entre ustedes será su servidor' (The greatest among you shall be your servant), which retains the authoritative tone of the original scripture. While the translation is accessible and suitable for contemporary readers, it should aim for greater precision to preserve the original meaning and tone. Overall, it demonstrates a solid understanding of the source material, but adjustments could enhance its fidelity to the biblical text.

**MAT 24:43**: _(Grade 83.3)_

**Source**:

**Translation**:
> De la misma manera que el padre de familia se mantiene vigilante para que los ladrones no se introduzcan en la casa, ("In the same way, the householder stays alert so that thieves do not enter the house,")

### Combined Review
The translation of MAT 24:43 has received varied feedback highlighting both strengths and areas for improvement. Generally, the translation captures the essence of the original Greek text, making it accessible for a modern Spanish-speaking audience. However, several reviews pointed out that the phrase 'de la misma manera que el padre de familia se mantiene vigilante' could be improved to emphasize vigilance more directly, possibly as 'así como el dueño de casa se mantiene alerta'. Additionally, it has been noted that the translation is incomplete, lacking crucial elements from the original scripture that convey the urgency of the warning. To enhance accuracy and clarity, it is important to retain the original imagery and message regarding preparedness for Christ's return. Overall, while the translation is modern and engaging, it would benefit from adjustments to improve faithfulness to the text and enhance the tone of alertness inherent in the scripture.

**MAT 26:48**: _(Grade 83.3)_  

**Source**:  
> ὁ δὲ παραδιδοὺς αὐτὸν ἔδωκεν αὐτοῖς σημεῖον λέγων· ὃν ἂν φιλήσω, αὐτός ἐστι· κρατήσατε αὐτόν.  
(Translation: "And he who was betraying him gave them a sign, saying, 'Whomever I kiss, he is the one; seize him.")  

**Translation**:  
> esperaban solamente que Judas identificara con un beso al Maestro.  
(Translation: "they were only waiting for Judas to identify the Master with a kiss.")  

**Combined Review**: _(Grade 85)_  
The translation of MAT 26:48 effectively captures the essence of the original Greek text while maintaining accessibility for Spanish speakers. The phrase "esperaban solamente que Judas identificara con un beso al Maestro" conveys the urgency behind Judas's actions, but there is room for improvement in emphasizing the betrayal aspect of the verse. Suggested revisions include using a more direct phrase like "aquel a quien besara" or rephrasing it to clarify Judas's role as the betrayer, such as "El traidor les dio una señal: al que yo bese, ese es; agárrenlo". These adjustments would enhance both clarity and the emotional impact of the moment, making the translation more resonant for the audience. Overall, the translation meets the objective of being relatable and modern, but minor tweaks could further enrich its clarity and seriousness regarding Judas's betrayal.

**MAT 3:8**: _(Grade 83.8)_

**Source**:
> ποιήσατε οὖν καρπὸν ἄξιον τῆς μετανοίας (Therefore, produce fruit worthy of repentance)

**Translation**:
> Demuestren, antes de bautizarse, que están arrepentidos. (Demonstrate, before being baptized, that you are repentant.)

**Combined Review** _(Grade 84.2)_: The translation of Matthew 3:8, "Demuestren, antes de bautizarse, que están arrepentidos," generally captures the essence of the original Greek text. It effectively communicates the imperative nature of repentance. However, several reviewers noted that the phrase "antes de bautizarse" may inadvertently suggest that repentance is merely a prerequisite to baptism, rather than emphasizing the necessity of producing evidence of true repentance as stated in the Greek. A more direct rendering like "Produzcan, pues, frutos dignos de arrepentimiento" (Produce, therefore, fruits worthy of repentance) would enhance accuracy and theological clarity. Additionally, the translation could better reflect the depth and urgency of the original message. While it is engaging for contemporary Spanish-speaking audiences, the feedback highlights opportunities for improving fidelity to the source text. Overall, the translation is solid, but revisions are recommended for greater precision and alignment with the original intent.

**MAT 19:3**: _(Grade 83.8)_

**Source**:
> Καὶ προσῆλθον αὐτῷ οἱ Φαρισαῖοι πειράζοντες αὐτὸν καὶ λέγοντες αὐτῷ· εἰ ἔξεστιν ἀνθρώπῳ ἀπολῦσαι τὴν γυναῖκα αὐτοῦ κατὰ πᾶσαν αἰτίαν; (And the Pharisees came to Him, testing Him, and saying to Him, "Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife for any reason?")

**Translation**:
> Varios fariseos, en una entrevista, trataron de hacerlo caer en la trampa de decir algo que luego ellos pudieran utilizar contra él. (Several Pharisees, in an interview, tried to trap Him into saying something they could later use against Him.)  
> —¿Apruebas el divorcio? —le preguntaron. ("Do you approve of divorce?" they asked.)

**Combined Review**:
The translation of MAT 19:3 is generally engaging and modern, effectively conveying the interaction between Jesus and the Pharisees. However, it presents some issues concerning the gravity and context of the original text. Phrases like "en una entrevista" do not adequately capture the confrontational nature of the encounter, which was a testing rather than a casual discussion. Additionally, "trataron de hacerlo caer en la trampa" and the simplification to "¿Apruebas el divorcio?" may undermine the seriousness of the topic of divorce, which is critical for a conservative Christian audience. A more direct approach that maintains the solemnity and authority of the dialogue would enhance accuracy without sacrificing readability. Overall, while the translation is accessible, it would benefit from adjustments to ensure it reflects the seriousness of the inquiry posed to Jesus.

**MAT 13:37**: _(Grade 84.2)_

**Source**:
> ὁ δὲ ἀποκριθεὶς εἶπεν αὐτοῖς· ὁ σπείρων τὸ καλὸν σπέρμα ἐστὶν ὁ υἱὸς τοῦ ἀνθρώπου· (And he answered and said to them: The one sowing the good seed is the Son of Man)

**Translation**:
> —Muy bien—comenzó—: Yo soy el labrador que siembra el grano selecto. (Very well—he began—: I am the farmer who sows the select grain.)

**Combined Review** _(Grade 85)_: The translation of MAT 13:37 is generally well executed, capturing the essence of the original Greek text while striving to be modern and accessible for Spanish-speaking audiences. However, the phrase "Yo soy el labrador que siembra el grano selecto" may lead to ambiguity, as 'labrador' (farmer) is less precise than the original Greek 'ο σπείρων' (the sower). A more accurate term such as "el Hijo del Hombre" (the Son of Man) would better reflect Jesus' identity, which is essential for conservative interpretations. Additionally, the informal tone could detract from the reverence typically associated with biblical text. Overall, the translation is commendable, yet slight adjustments in terminology and tone could enhance its fidelity and respect towards the original scripture.

**MAT 10:10**: _(Grade 84.3)_

**Source**:
> μὴ πήραν εἰς ὁδὸν μηδὲ δύο χιτῶνας μηδὲ ὑποδήματα μηδὲ ῥάβδον· ἄξιος γάρ ἐστιν ὁ ἐργάτης τῆς τροφῆς αὐτοῦ.  
>(Do not take a bag for the journey, or extra tunics, or sandals, or a staff; for the worker is worthy of his food.)

**Translation**:
> ni bolsa con comida; no lleven más túnicas ni más calzado que los que traen puestos, ni lleven bordón, porque las personas a las que ustedes ayuden tienen el deber de alimentarlos y cuidarlos.  
>(do not take a bag for the journey; do not carry extra tunics or sandals, or a staff, because those whom you help have the duty to care for them.)

**Combined Review Summary**:  
The translation of Matthew 10:10 effectively conveys the original meaning while maintaining a modern and accessible style for Spanish speakers. It preserves essential elements and communicates directives clearly. However, the phrase "porque las personas a las que ustedes ayuden tienen el deber de alimentarlos y cuidarlos" introduces a potential interpretative bias that shifts focus from the directive of relying on the hospitality of others to an implied obligation from recipients. This can create ambiguity and detracts from the simplicity of the original message, which emphasizes the worthiness of the worker without suggesting a duty from those being ministered to. It is recommended to revise this phrase for greater fidelity to the original text. Overall, the translation is strong, capturing the essential message, but minor improvements in clarity and adherence to the original intention could enhance its effectiveness.

**MAT 15:21**: _(Grade 84.5)_

**Source**:
> Καὶ ἐξελθὼν ἐκεῖθεν ὁ Ἰησοῦς ἀνεχώρησεν εἰς τὰ μέρη Τύρου καὶ Σιδῶνος. (And going out from there, Jesus withdrew to the regions of Tyre and Sidon.)

**Translation**:
> Jesús salió de allí y caminó los ochenta kilómetros que lo separaban de la región de Tiro y Sidón. (Jesus left there and walked the eighty kilometers that separated him from the region of Tyre and Sidon.)

### Combined Review Summary
The translation of MAT 15:21 effectively communicates the essence of the original text while being accessible for modern Spanish speakers. However, several reviews noted that the phrase "caminó los ochenta kilómetros que lo separaban" adds unnecessary detail not present in the Greek source, which simply indicates Jesus' movement to the regions of Tyre and Sidon without specifying a distance. While this detail may enhance engagement for some readers, it could detract from the text's fidelity and clarity. A more straightforward translation, such as "Jesús salió de allí y fue a la región de Tiro y Sidón" (Jesus left there and went to the region of Tyre and Sidon), may better align with the intention of maintaining textual integrity while remaining accessible. Overall, the translation is well-received but has room for improvement in its adherence to the original text.

**MAT 10:12**: _(Grade 84.7)_

**Source**:  
> εἰσερχόμενοι δὲ εἰς τὴν οἰκίαν ἀσπάσασθε αὐτὴν λέγοντες· εἰρήνη τῷ οἴκῳ τούτῳ. (And as you enter the house, greet it, saying, 'Peace be to this house.')  

**Translation**:  
> Y al entrar a la casa, den su bendición a los que allí viven. (And upon entering the house, bless those who live there.)

### Combined Review Summary:  
The translation of MAT 10:12 effectively captures the essential message of the original Greek text, though there are several areas for refinement. The phrase "den su bendición a los que allí viven" could benefit from more direct translations like "saluden" or "digan paz" to better reflect the intention of greeting with peace, as emphasized in the original verse (εἰρήνη). While the modern and accessible style is suitable for Spanish speakers, the choice of "bendición" may dilute the specific meaning of "peace" that carries significant spiritual weight in conservative Christian interpretation. The translation is generally clear and aligns with the objective of accessibility, but slight adjustments to incorporate the concept of peace more directly would enhance its fidelity to the original text.

**MAT 15:11**: _(Grade 84.7)_

**Source**:
> οὐ τὸ εἰσερχόμενον εἰς τὸ στόμα κοινοῖ τὸν ἄνθρωπον, ἀλλὰ τὸ ἐκπορευόμενον ἐκ τοῦ στόματος τοῦτο κοινοῖ τὸν ἄνθρωπον.  
(Translation: "Not what goes into the mouth defiles a man, but what comes out of the mouth, this defiles a man.")

**Translation**:
> Lo que daña el alma no es lo que entra por la boca, sino los pensamientos malos y las palabras con que estos se expresan.  
(Translation: "What harms the soul is not what enters through the mouth, but the bad thoughts and the words by which they are expressed.")

**Combined Review**: The translation of Matthew 15:11 effectively conveys the essential message of the verse, emphasizing that it is not what enters the mouth that defiles a person but rather what comes out of it. However, the phrase "daña el alma" may be seen as an over-interpretation; a more literal translation such as "contamina al hombre" (defiles a man) would align more closely with the original Greek text. It's important that the focus remains on the actions and words that reflect the heart's condition rather than an interpretation of soul damage. Adjustments to the phrase regarding speech versus thoughts would enhance clarity and fidelity to the text. The modern, accessible language is commendable, particularly for a Latin American audience, but maintaining a stricter adherence to the original wording could improve theological accuracy.

**MAT 18:28**: _(Grade 84.7)_

**Source**:
> ἐξελθὼν δὲ ὁ δοῦλος ἐκεῖνος εὗρεν ἕνα τῶν συνδούλων αὐτοῦ, ὃς ὤφειλεν αὐτῷ ἑκατὸν δηνάρια, καὶ κρατήσας αὐτὸν ἔπνιγε λέγων· ἀπόδος μοι εἴ τι ὀφείλεις. ("But when that same servant went out, he found one of his fellow servants who owed him a hundred denarii, and he seized him and began to choke him, saying, 'Pay what you owe.'")

**Translation**:
> »Pero cuando aquel mismo hombre salió de allí, fue adonde estaba alguien que le debía veinte mil pesos ("twenty thousand pesos") y, agarrándolo por el cuello ("seizing him by the neck"), exigió pago inmediato ("demanded immediate payment").

**Combined Review**: The translation of MAT 18:28 is generally clear and accessible, successfully conveying the essence of the original text for a modern Spanish-speaking audience. However, there are significant concerns regarding the translation of the debt amount. The original Greek refers to 'a hundred denarii', which is not accurately reflected by the phrase 'veinte mil pesos', as this could mislead readers about the gravity of the situation depicted in the parable. While the use of contemporary language helps engage the audience, it is crucial to ensure that key elements like the debt amount align with the biblical context to maintain theological accuracy. Additionally, expressions such as 'agarrándolo por el cuello' may be too colloquial and should be reconsidered for a more formal tone without losing accessibility. Overall, the translation meets the objective of accessibility but requires adjustments for precision and fidelity to the original text.

**MAT 19:12**: _(Grade 84.7)_

**Source**:
> εἰσὶ γὰρ εὐνοῦχοι οἵτινες ἐκ κοιλίας μητρὸς ἐγεννήθησαν οὕτω. καὶ εἰσὶν εὐνοῦχοι οἵτινες εὐνουχίσθησαν ὑπὸ τῶν ἀνθρώπων, καὶ εἰσιν εὐνοῦχοι οἵτινες εὐνούχισαν ἑαυτοὺς διὰ τὴν βασιλείαν τῶν οὐρανῶν. ὁ δυνάμενος χωρεῖν χωρείτω.  
(For there are eunuchs who were born that way from their mother’s womb, and there are eunuchs who were made eunuchs by men, and there are eunuchs who made themselves eunuchs for the kingdom of heaven. The one who is able to accept this, let him accept it.)

**Translation**:
> Hay personas que no se casan porque nacieron incapacitados para el matrimonio; otros no lo hacen porque los hombres los incapacitaron; y aun otros, porque no desean hacerlo por amor al reino de los cielos. El que pueda aceptar esto último, que lo acepte.

**Combined Review**: The translation of MAT 19:12 is commendable for its clarity and accessibility to modern Spanish-speaking audiences, particularly in Latin America. It successfully conveys the core message regarding eunuchs and their reasons for celibacy, aligning with conservative Christian values related to the Kingdom of Heaven. However, several reviews highlight the use of the phrase "incapacitados para el matrimonio," which may diminish the theological understanding of eunuchs, potentially causing ambiguity. Some reviewers suggest that a more direct reference to "eunuchs" would enhance the translation's accuracy and respect for the original text. Additionally, the ending phrase "que lo acepte" may come across as informal for a biblical context, indicating a need for more reverent wording. Overall, while the translation is engaging and relevant, careful consideration of language choices could elevate its fidelity to the scriptural message.

**MAT 6:3**: _(Grade 85.0)_

**Source**:  
> σοῦ δὲ ποιοῦντος ἐλεημοσύνην μὴ γνώτω ἡ ἀριστερά σου τί ποιεῖ ἡ δεξιά σου, (But when you give to the needy, let not your left hand know what your right hand is doing)

**Translation**:  
> Pero cuando hagan algún bien, háganlo discretamente. (But when you do good, do it discreetly)

**Combined Review**:  
The translation of MAT 6:3 is generally well-executed and captures the essence of the original Greek text while maintaining a modern and accessible style for Spanish speakers. However, the phrase "háganlo discretamente" may be seen as less impactful than the original phrase "μὴ γνώτω ἡ ἀριστερά σου τί ποιεῖ ἡ δεξιά σου" which emphasizes a deeper instruction regarding secrecy in charitable actions. A more accurate and direct translation such as "que no sepa tu mano izquierda lo que hace tu mano derecha" would preserve the metaphorical nuance of humility and anonymity in giving. While the translation succeeds in being clear and relatable to the target audience, refining the expression to align more closely with the original text would enhance its fidelity and depth. Overall, the translation is commendable but could benefit from adjustments to improve precision and convey the full weight of the instruction.

**MAT 6:16**: _(Grade 85.0)_

**Source**:
> Ὅταν δὲ νηστεύητε, μὴ γίνεσθε ὥσπερ οἱ ὑποκριταὶ σκυθρωποί· ἀφανίζουσι γὰρ τὰ πρόσωπα αὐτῶν ὅπως φανῶσι τοῖς ἀνθρώποις νηστεύοντες· ἀμὴν λέγω ὑμῖν ὅτι ἀπέχουσι τὸν μισθὸν αὐτῶν.  
(Translation: "When you fast, do not look somber as the hypocrites do, for they disfigure their faces to show others they are fasting. Truly I tell you, they have received their reward in full.")

**Translation**:
> »Cuando ustedes ayunen, no lo hagan en público como los hipócritas, que tratan de aparentar que están pálidos y desaliñados para que la gente se dé cuenta de que ayunaron. Les aseguro que, aparte de esto, no tendrán más recompensa.

**Combined Review**:  
The translation of MAT 6:16 is clear and accessible, effectively conveying the message intended in the original text. While it is relatable for modern Spanish-speaking audiences, certain phrases need refinement. The expression 'aparte de esto, no tendrán más recompensa' does not fully reflect the gravity of the original Greek, which emphasizes the complete absence of reward for hypocrisy. Additionally, the phrase 'tratan de aparentar que están pálidos y desaliñados' may be misleading, as it focuses on outward appearances rather than the core issue of hypocrisy. Suggestions for improvement include simplifying or altering language to capture the nuances of the original scripture while preserving clarity and faithfulness to the conservative Christian perspective. Overall, while the translation meets accessibility standards, slight adjustments could enhance accuracy and maintain reverence.

**MAT 17:15**: _(Grade 85.0)_

**Source**:
> Κύριε, ἐλέησόν μου τὸν υἱόν, ὅτι σεληνιάζεται καὶ κακῶς πάσχει· πολλάκις γὰρ πίπτει εἰς τὸ πῦρ καὶ πολλάκις εἰς τὸ ὕδωρ. (Lord, have mercy on my son, for he is epileptic and suffers terribly; he often falls into the fire and often into the water.)

**Translation**:
> ―Señor —dijo—, ten misericordia de mi hijo, que está enfermo de la mente y padece muchísimo. Muchas veces se cae en el fuego o en el agua, con peligro de su vida. ("Lord," he said, "have mercy on my son, who is sick in the mind and suffers greatly. Many times he falls into the fire or into the water, at the risk of his life.")

**Combined Review**: 
The translation of MAT 17:15 is commendable and successfully conveys the essential meaning of the original Greek text while utilizing modern and accessible language appropriate for Latin American Spanish speakers. However, there are concerns regarding the translation of 'σεληνιάζεται' (epileptic or moon-struck) as 'está enfermo de la mente' (is sick in the mind). This rendering may imply a more psychological condition rather than the traditional interpretation related to demonic possession, which is a significant aspect of the original text. While the urgency of the father's plea is effectively maintained, a more precise term that reflects the original's gravity—such as 'poseído' (possessed) or 'lunático' (moonstruck)—could enhance both clarity and theological accuracy. Overall, while the translation meets accessibility goals, slight adjustments are suggested for a more traditional and faithful representation of the source material.

**MAT 18:34**: _(Grade 85.0)_

**Source**:
> καὶ ὀργισθεὶς ὁ κύριος αὐτοῦ παρέδωκεν αὐτὸν τοῖς βασανισταῖς ἕως οὗ ἀποδῷ πᾶν τὸ ὀφειλόμενον αὐτῷ. (And being angry, his lord delivered him to the torturers until he should pay all that was due unto him.)

**Translation**:
> Tan enojado estaba el rey que lo envió a las cámaras de tortura hasta que pagara el último centavo. (The king was so angry that he sent him to the torture chambers until he paid the last penny.)

**Combined Review**: _(Grade 85)_
The translation of MAT 18:34 effectively captures the essence of the original Greek text, clearly communicating the king's anger and the severe consequence faced by the servant. The phrase 'cámaras de tortura' (torture chambers) successfully conveys the seriousness of the punishment, although it may be perceived as overly graphic for a conservative Christian audience. A more nuanced term such as 'lugar de tormento' (place of torment) or 'lugar de castigo' (place of punishment) might better suit the sensibilities of that demographic while maintaining the gravity of the message. The translation effectively conveys the emotional weight of the passage and its themes of forgiveness and judgment, making it accessible to Spanish speakers, but could benefit from slight adjustments for improved audience sensitivity. Overall, it is a strong translation that aligns well with conservative Christian values, meriting a score of 85.

(But Jesus called them to him and said, "You know that the rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them, and their great ones exercise authority over them.")

**Translation**:
> pero Jesús los llamó y les dijo:
> ―En las naciones paganas, los reyes, los tiranos o cualquier funcionario está por encima de sus súbditos.  
(But Jesus called them and said: "In the pagan nations, the kings, the tyrants, or any official are above their subjects.")

### Combined Review:
The translation of MAT 20:25 successfully captures the essence of the original text, presenting it in a modern and accessible manner suitable for Spanish-speaking audiences in Latin America. However, the phrase "los reyes, los tiranos o cualquier funcionario está por encima de sus súbditos" introduces a potentially negative connotation that is not present in the original Greek text, which conveys authority in a more neutral context. Several reviewers suggest replacing "tirano" with a more neutral term like "gobernantes de las naciones" or simply "los grandes" to maintain fidelity to the scripture’s intent and avoid any emotional bias. Additionally, the term "súbditos" may not resonate with all readers; alternatives like "ciudadanos" or "seguidores" could improve relatability. Overall, while the translation is clear and understandable, adjustments to word choice and phrasing are recommended to enhance theological precision and reflect the original structure more accurately.

**MAT 21:30**: _(Grade 85.0)_

**Source**:
> καὶ προσελθὼν τῷ δευτέρῳ εἶπεν ὡσαύτως. ὁ δὲ ἀποκριθεὶς εἶπεν· ἐγώ, κύριε· καὶ οὐκ ἀπῆλθε. (And coming to the second, he said likewise. And he answered and said, 'I go, sir,' but he did not go.)

**Translation**:
> Cuando el padre le pidió al menor que fuera, este le respondió: “¡Con mucho gusto! ¡Ahora mismo voy!”. Pero no fue. Díganme: (When the father asked the younger one to go, he responded, "With pleasure! Right now!" But he did not go. Tell me:)

**Combined Review**: The translation of MAT 21:30 is generally clear and accessible, effectively conveying the essence of the original Greek text. However, the phrase '¡Con mucho gusto! ¡Ahora mismo voy!' may come across as overly casual or even sarcastic, which does not fully respect the seriousness of the original context. Suggested alternatives like 'Sí, padre; ahora mismo voy' or 'Sí, voy' would maintain a more appropriate tone of respect and urgency. Additionally, the phrase 'Díganme:' at the end could be confusing as it seems out of place. Overall, while the translation is strong and captures the message well, minor adjustments are recommended for improved clarity and fidelity to the original text.

**MAT 22:4**: _(Grade 85.0)_  

**Source**:  
> πάλιν ἀπέστειλεν ἄλλους δούλους λέγων· εἴπατε τοῖς κεκλημένοις· ἰδοὺ τὸ ἄριστόν μου ἡτοίμασα, οἱ ταῦροί μου καὶ τὰ σιτιστὰ τεθυμένα, καὶ πάντα ἕτοιμα· δεῦτε εἰς τοὺς γάμους. (Again he sent other servants saying, "Tell those who are invited: Look, my feast is ready, my oxen and fattened calves have been slaughtered, and everything is ready; come to the wedding.")  

**Translation**:  
> Envió a otros siervos a decirles que fueran pronto, que no se demoraran, que ya los asados estaban listos. (He sent other servants to tell them to come quickly, that the roasted meat was ready.)  

### Combined Review:  
The translation of MAT 22:4 successfully captures the essence of the original text while employing modern and accessible language for Spanish speakers. However, there are several important considerations. While the phrase "que no se demoraran" conveys a sense of urgency, it may come off as too casual and could be strengthened with a more direct expression like "vengan pronto" to reflect the immediate nature of the invitation. Additionally, the use of the term "asados" might be perceived as informal and may detract from the reverence typically associated with biblical texts. A suggestion would be to use terms like "banquete" or "comida" which would better reflect the solemnity of the occasion. Overall, the translation is effective, engaging, and maintains theological integrity, but minor adjustments in phrasing and word choice could enhance its fidelity and respectfulness in alignment with conservative Christian values.

> Οἱ δὲ Φαρισαῖοι ἀκούσαντες ὅτι ἐφίμωσε τοὺς Σαδδουκαίους, συνήχθησαν ἐπὶ τὸ αὐτό,  
(Translation: But the Pharisees, hearing that he had silenced the Sadducees, gathered together.)

**Translation**:  
> Los fariseos no se dejaron amedrentar por la derrota de los saduceos  
(Translation: The Pharisees were not intimidated by the defeat of the Sadducees)

**Combined Review**:  
The translation of MAT 22:34 is considered clear and accessible for a modern Spanish-speaking audience, especially in Latin America. However, there is a consensus that the phrase "no se dejaron amedrentar por la derrota de los saduceos" does not accurately convey the original intent of the Greek text. The emphasis should be on the Pharisees gathering in response to Jesus silencing the Sadducees, rather than suggesting they were not intimidated by a defeat. Suggestions for improvement include using a more neutral phrasing such as "los fariseos, al oír que Jesús había silenciado a los saduceos, se reunieron entre sí" (the Pharisees, upon hearing that Jesus had silenced the Sadducees, gathered together), which would better reflect the solemnity and seriousness of the context. Overall, while the translation's style is modern and suitable for the audience, enhancing accuracy and maintaining a reverent tone would be beneficial in preserving the integrity of the biblical text.

(And you have filled the measure of your fathers.)

**Translation**:  
> ¡Acaben de imitarlos! ¡Pónganse a la altura de ellos!  
(End up imitating them! Measure up to them!)

**Combined Review**:  
The translation of MAT 23:32 as "¡Acaben de imitarlos! ¡Pónganse a la altura de ellos!" captures the essence of the original Greek text but has received mixed feedback. While many reviews appreciate the contemporary and engaging style for a modern Spanish-speaking audience, concerns have been raised about the phrase "¡Acaben de imitarlos!" This expression may imply a neutral or positive action rather than conveying the condemnation intended in the original message. A more accurate rendering could clarify that the listeners are filling the measure of their fathers' sins, aligning more closely with the Greek text's meaning. Suggestions such as using "¡Completen la medida de sus padres!" have been proposed to enhance clarity and fidelity to the original intent. Overall, while the translation is engaging and resonates with the audience, it requires adjustments to improve its accuracy and alignment with conservative Christian perspectives.

**Translation**:
> Pero esto será sólo el principio de los horrores que vendrán. (But this will be only the beginning of the horrors that will come.)

**Combined Review** _(Overall Grade 85)_: The translation "Pero esto será sólo el principio de los horrores que vendrán" generally conveys the urgency and seriousness of the original Greek text. However, the term "horrores" may not fully encapsulate the theological significance of "birth pains" as it pertains to the suffering preceding the end times. While the translation is accessible for a Latin American audience and effectively communicates the gravity of the message, some reviewers suggested that terms like "dolores" (pains) or "tribulaciones" (tribulations) could enhance clarity and align more closely with traditional interpretations. Adjustments to soften the language might help to maintain the prophetic nature of the text without inducing unnecessary fear, thus enhancing fidelity to the original meaning. Overall, the translation is strong but could benefit from minor refinements.

**MAT 24:10**: _(Grade 85.0)_

**Source**:
> καὶ τότε σκανδαλισθήσονται πολλοὶ καὶ ἀλλήλους παραδώσουσι καὶ μισήσουσιν ἀλλήλους. (And then many will be offended and will betray one another, and will hate one another.)

**Translation**:
> y muchos de ustedes volverán a caer en pecado y traicionarán y aborrecerán a los demás. (and many of you will fall into sin again and will betray and will hate one another.)

**Combined Review**: 
The translation of MAT 24:10 is generally accurate and captures the original meaning; however, the phrase 'volverán a caer en pecado' may be misleading as it does not fully convey the original Greek term 'σκανδαλισθήσονται', which implies a more serious stumbling or offense related to faith. A more precise translation could be 'y muchos de ustedes se escandalizarán', which reflects the essence of the original text. Additionally, while 'aborrecerán a los demás' indicates hatred, it could be more accurately expressed as 'se odiarán mutuamente' to emphasize mutual betrayal. Overall, the translation meets accessibility objectives but would benefit from slight adjustments for improved clarity and theological accuracy.

**MAT 25:24-25**: _(Grade 85.0)_

**Source**:
> προσελθὼν δὲ καὶ ὁ τὸ ἓν τάλαντον εἰληφὼς εἶπε· κύριε· ἔγνων σε ὅτι σκληρὸς εἶ ἄνθρωπος, θερίζων ὅπου οὐκ ἔσπειρας καὶ συνάγων ὅθεν οὐ διεσκόρπισας·
> καὶ φοβηθεὶς ἀπελθὼν ἔκρυψα τὸ τάλαντόν σου ἐν τῇ γῇ· ἴδε ἔχεις τὸ σόν.  

**Translation**:
> "When the one who had received the one talent came, he said, 'Master, I knew you to be a hard man, reaping where you did not sow and gathering where you scattered no seed; and fearing, I went and hid your talent in the ground; here you have what is yours.'"  

**Review Summary**:  
The translation of MAT 25:24-25 is generally effective and maintains the original meaning while using modern Spanish that is accessible for Latin American readers. However, the term 'duro' (hard) may misrepresent the master's character and could be better rendered to reflect a more traditional understanding of God's nature, aligning with conservative values. The phrase 'hasta el último centavo' (to the last cent) might come across as informal and trivializes the gravity of the situation. Furthermore, adjustments are recommended to emphasize the servant's fear and misunderstanding of his master's true character more accurately. Overall, while the translation is fluent and clear, it requires some refinements to enhance fidelity to the original text and reflect a more respectful tone appropriate for biblical scripture.

**Translation**:  
> "¡Malvado! ¡Haragán! Si sabías que quería obtener utilidades,  

### Combined Review  
The translation of MAT 25:26 effectively conveys the essence of the original Greek text, maintaining accessibility for modern Spanish speakers while capturing the master's reproach towards the servant. However, the terms "malvado" (wicked) and "haragán" (lazy) might not fully reflect the gravity of the condemnation inherent in traditional interpretations. The phrase "si sabías que quería obtener utilidades" (if you knew that I wanted to make a profit) could benefit from a more direct expression of the original Greek's accusatory tone. Consider using alternatives such as "siervo malo y perezoso" (bad and lazy servant) for greater fidelity to the text. Overall, the translation is clear and accessible but would benefit from slight adjustments in wording to enhance the theological depth and seriousness of the original scripture.

**Source**:  
> καὶ ἐχθροὶ τοῦ ἀνθρώπου οἱ οἰκιακοὶ αὐτοῦ. (And a man's enemies will be those of his own household.)  

**Translation**:  
> ¡Cada quien tendrá a sus peores enemigos en su propia casa! (Everyone will have their worst enemies in their own house!)  

**Combined Review**: _(Grade 85)_  
The translation of MAT 10:36 as "¡Cada quien tendrá a sus peores enemigos en su propia casa!" effectively conveys the essence of the original Greek text, addressing the conflict within familial relationships that Jesus describes. It uses modern and accessible Spanish suitable for Latin American audiences, promoting engagement and relatability. However, the colloquial nature of phrases like "peores enemigos" and "¡Cada quien!" might come across as too informal or casual for a conservative Christian audience. While the translation achieves its goal of accessibility, it would benefit from minor adjustments in language and tone to better reflect the reverence and seriousness of the original scripture. Suggested revisions include considering a more literal phrasing, such as "los mayores enemigos," and maintaining the depth and emotional impact of the message. Overall, it is a solid translation with room for refinement.

(Translation: "He said, 'Yes.' And when he entered the house, Jesus anticipated him, saying, 'What do you think, Simon? From whom do the kings of the earth take customs or taxes, from their sons or from strangers?")  

**Translation**:  
> —¡Claro que los paga! —les respondió Pedro—, e inmediatamente entró a la casa a hablarle a Jesús sobre el asunto.  
(No translation needed)  
> No había pronunciado todavía la primera palabra, cuando Jesús le preguntó: —  
> ¿A quién crees tú, Pedro, que cobran tributos los reyes de la tierra? ¿A sus súbditos o a los extranjeros?  
(No translation needed)  

**Combined Review**:  
The translation of MAT 17:25 generally achieves clarity and modern accessibility while maintaining the essence of the original text. While the dialogue feels engaging and natural, there are concerns about the formality of certain phrases, particularly "¡Claro que los paga!", which may be overly colloquial for a sacred text. The intention to connect with Spanish speakers in Latin America is commendable; however, maintaining a respectful and reverent tone throughout is crucial. Adjustments could be made to ensure a closer alignment with the original text, especially regarding the nuances and rhetorical nature of Jesus' question. Overall, the translation is effective but would benefit from a more formal and faithful representation of the original dialogue.  

**Final Rating**:  
The overall rating remains at an average of 85.3, reflecting a solid effort with room for improvement.

**Translation**:
> Así fue como José regresó a la tierra de Israel con el niño y su madre. Pero en el camino se enteró de que Arquelao, hijo de Herodes, reinaba en Judea, y tuvo miedo de ir allí.  (This is how Joseph returned to the land of Israel with the child and his mother. But along the way, he learned that Archelaus, son of Herod, was reigning in Judea, and he was afraid to go there.)

**Combined Review**:  The translation of MAT 2:21 is generally accurate and maintains the essence of the original Greek text. It effectively communicates the action of Joseph returning to Israel with the child and his mother while using modern and accessible Spanish. Most reviewers noted that while the phrasing is fluid and appropriate for a Latin American audience, the additional context regarding Archelaus may detract from the direct translation goal, as this detail is not present in the Greek text. Minor adjustments could enhance clarity without compromising fidelity to the source material. Overall, this translation successfully balances accessibility with a contemporary style.

(Translation: "And he said to him, 'If you are the Son of God, throw yourself down; for it is written, 'He will command his angels concerning you,' and 'On their hands they will bear you up, lest you strike your foot against a stone.'")  

**Translation**:  
> —Si eres el Hijo de Dios —le dijo—, tírate desde aquí. Las Escrituras dicen que Dios enviará a sus ángeles a cuidarte, y ni siquiera te tropezarás con las rocas.  
(Translation: "—If you are the Son of God —he said—, throw yourself down from here. The Scriptures say that God will send his angels to take care of you, and you will not even strike your foot against the rocks.")  

### Combined Review  
The translation of MAT 4:6 effectively conveys the original text's message while utilizing accessible modern Spanish. The phrase 'tírate desde aquí' maintains the imperative nature of the original; however, it may benefit from using 'lánzate' to sound more dynamic. The explanation regarding the Scriptures emphasizes their authority, which is important for a conservative Christian audience. The translation's phrase 'y ni siquiera te tropezarás con las rocas' is seen as somewhat colloquial and could detract from the seriousness of Jesus' response to temptation. A more traditional rendering might preserve the reverence expected in Scripture. Overall, while the translation meets the objective of clarity and engagement, it could be enhanced by incorporating a more formal tone and explicitly quoting Scripture for theological alignment.

**MAT 8:6**: _(Grade 85.5)_

**Source**:
> Κύριε, ὁ παῖς μου βέβληται ἐν τῇ οἰκίᾳ παραλυτικός, δεινῶς βασανιζόμενος. (Lord, my servant is lying at home paralyzed, dreadfully tormented.)

**Translation**:
> que sanara a un sirviente que estaba en cama paralítico y que sufría mucho. (that he may heal a servant who is bedridden, paralyzed, and suffering greatly.)

### Combined Review
The translation of Matthew 8:6 generally captures the essential meaning of the original Greek text, reflecting the urgency of the centurion's plea. Phrases like 'que sanara a un sirviente que estaba en cama paralítico y que sufría mucho' convey the situation clearly and are accessible for modern Spanish audiences. However, there are several areas for improvement:  
1. The term 'sirviente' might not fully encompass the original Greek term 'παῖς' (pais), which carries connotations of a closer or more intimate relationship, possibly suggesting a son or loved one. Using 'mi niño' (my child) or 'mi siervo' (my servant) could add emotional depth.  
2. The phrase 'que sanara' may imply past action rather than the immediacy of a request. A direct phrasing like 'que cure a mi siervo...' could enhance the urgent tone.  
3. While the structure is generally clear, it can be made more fluid, avoiding phrases like 'y que sufría mucho' (and suffering much) to create a more natural flow.  

Overall, while the translation is clear and effective, slight adjustments in terminology and structure would enhance both clarity and the emotional weight of the plea, aligning it more closely with the original intent.

> εἰς ἣν δ᾽ ἂν πόλιν ἢ κώμην εἰσέλθητε, ἐξετάσατε τίς ἐν αὐτῇ ἄξιός ἐστι, κἀκεῖ μείνατε ἕως ἂν ἐξέλθητε. (Into whatever city or village you enter, inquire who is worthy in it, and stay there until you go out.)

**Translation**:
> Cuando lleguen a cualquier ciudad o pueblo, busquen a una persona de confianza (trustworthy person) y quédense en su casa (stay in his house) hasta que se vayan a otro pueblo (until you go out to another village).

**Combined Review**:
The translation of MAT 10:11 is commendable, effectively communicating the original intent of the scripture while maintaining clarity and modern accessibility for Spanish speakers. However, there is a consensus that the phrase 'busquen a una persona de confianza' (look for a trustworthy person) does not fully capture the original meaning of 'quién es digno' (who is worthy) implied in the Greek text. A suggested adjustment is to use 'una persona digna' (a worthy person) to align more closely with the biblical context. Additionally, simplifying 'hasta que se vayan a otro pueblo' (until you go to another village) to 'hasta que salgan' (until you leave) could enhance clarity. While the translation effectively relays the directive of staying in the home of those who welcome them, refining these phrases would better convey the intended nuances of the original text. Overall, this translation deserves a solid score, reflecting its effectiveness while acknowledging the potential for minor improvements in accuracy.

**MAT 10:26**: _(Grade 85.5)_

**Source**:
> μὴ οὖν φοβηθῆτε αὐτούς· οὐδὲν γάρ ἐστι κεκαλυμμένον ὃ οὐκ ἀποκαλυφθήσεται, καὶ κρυπτὸν ὃ οὐ γνωσθήσεται. (Do not therefore be afraid of them; for there is nothing covered that shall not be revealed, and hid that shall not be known.)

**Translation**:
> Pero no tengan miedo, porque pronto llegará la hora de la verdad y no habrá secreto que no se descubra. (But do not be afraid, for the hour of truth will soon come and there will be no secret that will not be uncovered.)

**Combined Review**: The translation of Matthew 10:26 effectively captures the essence of the original Greek text, reassuring readers not to fear because truth will ultimately be revealed. While the phrase "pero no tengan miedo" accurately conveys the intended reassurance, the interpretation of "pronto llegará la hora de la verdad" introduces a slight interpretive bias and diverges from the more direct rendering found in the source. Suggestions include a more literal translation such as "no habrá nada oculto que no será revelado" to preserve theological integrity and remain faithful to conservative Christian perspectives. Overall, the translation is accessible and suitable for a modern Spanish-speaking audience, but slight adjustments could enhance its accuracy and fidelity to the original message.

**MAT 13:46**: _(Grade 85.5)_

**Source**:
> ὃς εὑρὼν ἕνα πολύτιμον μαργαρίτην ἀπελθὼν πέπρακε πάντα ὅσα εἶχε καὶ ἠγόρασεν αὐτόν.  
(Who, upon finding one pearl of great value, went and sold all that he had and bought it.)

**Translation**:
> Por fin descubre una verdadera oportunidad cuando le ofrecen a buen precio una perla de gran valor. Entonces corre, vende todo lo que tiene y la compra.  
(Finally, he discovers a true opportunity when they offer him a pearl of great value at a good price. Then he runs, sells all that he has, and buys it.)

**Combined Review** _(Grade 85)_: The translation of MAT 13:46 effectively captures the essence of the original text while maintaining an engaging and modern tone suitable for Spanish-speaking audiences, particularly in Latin America. Phrases like 'verdadera oportunidad' convey a sense of excitement, but some reviews noted that this may distract from the original message of sacrifice for the Kingdom of Heaven. Suggestions were made to replace 'ofrecen a buen precio' with a phrase that better reflects the intrinsic value of the pearl, such as 'gran valor' or simply 'una perla de gran valor', to maintain fidelity to the text's meaning. Overall, while the translation is commendable in clarity and accessibility, slight adjustments to phrasing would enhance its faithfulness to the biblical text.

**MAT 14:4**: _(Grade 85.5)_  

**Source**:  
> ἔλεγε γὰρ αὐτῷ ὁ Ἰωάννης· οὐκ ἔξεστί σοι ἔχειν αὐτήν. (For John said to him, 'It is not lawful for you to have her.')  

**Translation**:  
> Herodías odiaba a Juan, porque este se había atrevido a decirle al rey que era incorrecto que se casara con ella. (Herodias hated John, because he had dared to tell the king that it was wrong for him to marry her.)  

**Combined Review**:  
The translation of MAT 14:4 generally conveys the original Greek text's essence while maintaining clarity for modern Spanish speakers. While the phrase 'se había atrevido a decirle al rey que era incorrecto' captures some meaning, it could be more precise by directly translating the prohibition mentioned in the original text, which is critical for understanding John the Baptist's condemnation of Herod's marriage to Herodias. Additionally, while the phrase 'odiaba a Juan' is accurate, the focus should ideally reflect John's authoritative rebuke rather than merely Herodias's feelings towards him. Overall, the translation is clear and accessible, but minor adjustments would enhance fidelity to the original intent and maintain a respectful tone appropriate for conservative interpretation.

**MAT 16:3**: _(Grade 85.5)_

**Source**:
> καὶ πρωΐ· σήμερον χειμών· πυρράζει γὰρ στυγνάζων ὁ οὐρανός. [ὑποκριταί,] τὸ μὲν πρόσωπον τοῦ οὐρανοῦ γινώσκετε διακρίνειν, τὰ δὲ σημεῖα τῶν καιρῶν οὐ δύνασθε [γνῶναι];

**Translation**:
> y si por la mañana se pone rojo, saben que habrá tempestad. ¡Y sin embargo, no pueden leer las notorias señales de los tiempos!  (And if in the morning it is red, you know there will be a storm. Yet, you cannot read the signs of the times!)

**Combined Review**:
The translation of MAT 16:3 is generally effective in conveying the meaning of the original text, but there are areas that require refinement for improved clarity and impact. While the phrase "si por la mañana se pone rojo, saben que habrá tempestad" captures the metaphorical essence, it may benefit from a more direct expression such as "si por la mañana se ve rojo, saben que habrá tormenta." The use of the term "notorias" in "¡Y sin embargo, no pueden leer las notorias señales de los tiempos!" could be replaced with a more common synonym to enhance accessibility. Moreover, the omission of the term "¡Hipócritas!" in the translation lessens the emphasis on Jesus' critique of the Pharisees, potentially diluting the message's impact. Overall, the translation is relatable and modern but would gain from adjustments that uphold the seriousness of Jesus' message and enhance adherence to the original context.

**MAT 26:45**: _(Grade 85.5)_

**Source**:  
> τότε ἔρχεται πρὸς τοὺς μαθητὰς αὐτοῦ καὶ λέγει αὐτοῖς· καθεύδετε τὸ λοιπὸν καὶ ἀναπαύεσθε! ἰδοὺ ἤγγικεν ἡ ὥρα καὶ ὁ υἱὸς τοῦ ἀνθρώπου παραδίδοται εἰς χεῖρας ἁμαρτωλῶν.  
(Translation: "Then he comes to his disciples and says to them: 'Sleep and rest now! Behold, the hour has come, and the Son of Man is being delivered into the hands of sinners.")  

**Translation**:  
> Cuando volvió a los discípulos les dijo:  
> «Duerman, descansen…, pero no, ha llegado la hora. Me van a entregar en manos de los pecadores.  
(Translation: "When he returned to the disciples, he said: 'Sleep, rest... but no, the hour has come. They are going to hand me over to the hands of sinners.'")  

### Combined Review Summary  
The translation of MAT 26:45 is generally clear and maintains the essence of the original text, effectively conveying Jesus' message. While the use of the phrase "Duerman, descansen..." is accessible and familiar for Spanish speakers, it may not fully reflect the gravity of the moment Jesus is facing. The urgency in the statement "..., pero no, ha llegado la hora" could be made more emphatic to better represent the original Greek tone. Some reviews noted that alternatives like using "los impíos" instead of "pecadores" might better capture the seriousness of the situation. Overall, the translation succeeds in its aim of accessibility and engagement for modern audiences, with minor adjustments recommended to enhance its emotional and spiritual depth.

(And while He was still speaking, behold, Judas, one of the twelve, came, and with him a great multitude with swords and clubs, from the chief priests and elders of the people.)

**Translation**:
> No había terminado de pronunciar estas palabras cuando Judas, uno de los doce, se acercó al frente de una turba armada con espadas y palos. Iban en nombre de los líderes judíos y  
(He had not yet finished speaking when Judas, one of the twelve, came up to him, and with him a great crowd armed with swords and clubs. They came from the Jewish leaders and)

**Combined Review** _(Grade 86)_:
The translation of MAT 26:47 effectively conveys the essential meaning of the original Greek text, accurately capturing the context of Judas approaching Jesus with an armed crowd for His arrest. The use of modern, accessible Spanish is commendable, making the text engaging for Latin American readers. However, the translation could benefit from enhancements in clarity and flow. Specifically, the phrase at the end of the translation feels incomplete and could be refined for coherence, perhaps by ensuring each sentence stands alone clearly. Additionally, rephrasing certain expressions like "turba armada con espadas y palos" and including elements such as 'pueblo' after 'líderes judíos' could enhance readability and contextual understanding. Overall, this is a strong translation with minor adjustments needed to improve fluidity and emotional impact.

(Translation: "And he laid it in his own new tomb, which he had hewn out in the rock: and he rolled a great stone to the door of the sepulchre, and departed.")  

**Translation**:  
> y lo colocó en un sepulcro nuevo labrado en la peña. Hacía poco que había hecho ese sepulcro y ordenó que rodaran una piedra grande para cerrar la entrada. José se alejó,  
(Translation: "And he placed it in a new tomb hewn in the rock. He had recently made that tomb and ordered that a large stone be rolled to close the entrance. Joseph departed,")  

**Combined Review** _(Grade 85)_ :  
The translation of MAT 27:60 successfully captures the essence of the original Greek text while making it accessible to contemporary Spanish readers. However, the phrase 'Hacía poco que había hecho ese sepulcro' can be seen as awkward and might imply a sense of hastiness that is not intended in the original text. A more direct and natural phrasing, such as 'Era un sepulcro nuevo, recién labrado en la roca,' would improve both clarity and engagement. Additionally, the phrase 'y ordenó que rodaran una piedra grande para cerrar la entrada' may benefit from simplification for better fluidity in modern Spanish. Overall, while the translation is clear and generally effective, slight adjustments are recommended to enhance naturalness and readability for the target audience.

**Translation**:
> Zorobabel de Abiud, Abiud de Eliaquín y Eliaquín de Azor.  
(Translation: Zorobabel begat Abiud, Abiud begat Eliakim, and Eliakim begat Azor.)

**Combined Review**:  
The translation of MAT 1:13 effectively conveys the lineage presented in the original Greek text. However, to enhance clarity and accessibility for modern Spanish readers, it is recommended to incorporate more explicit relational language. Suggestions include replacing 'de' with 'fue el padre de' (was the father of) for each name, which would clarify the relationships being described. Additionally, using 'y' (and) before each name may improve readability. While the translation is accurate and maintains the essence of the original, minor adjustments in phrasing and structure could enhance the overall engagement and understanding for readers. Therefore, the translation deserves a score of 85.

**MAT 6:11**: _(Grade 85.8)_

**Source**:
> τὸν ἄρτον ἡμῶν τὸν ἐπιούσιον δὸς ἡμῖν σήμερον· (Give us this day our daily bread)

**Translation**:
> Danos hoy los alimentos que necesitamos (Give us today the food we need)

**Combined Review** _(Grade 85)_: The translation of MAT 6:11 as "Danos hoy los alimentos que necesitamos" is clear and accessible for modern Spanish speakers, successfully conveying the request for daily provision. However, several reviews note that while this phrasing captures the essence of the original Greek text, it could benefit from incorporating the word 'pan' (bread) instead of 'alimentos' (food) to more accurately reflect the specific nuance and spiritual significance of 'daily bread' as intended in the biblical context. Overall, the translation is effective in its modern approach, yet minor adjustments could enhance its alignment with the original text's depth and theological meaning.

> ἦλθον γὰρ διχάσαι ἄνθρωπον κατὰ τοῦ πατρὸς αὐτοῦ καὶ θυγατέρα κατὰ τῆς μητρὸς αὐτῆς καὶ νύμφην κατὰ τῆς πενθερᾶς αὐτῆς·  (For I have come to set a man against his father, and a daughter against her mother, and a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law.)

**Translation**:
> a poner al hijo contra su padre, a la hija contra su madre, a la nuera contra su suegra.  (to set a son against his father, a daughter against her mother, a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law.)

**Combined Review**: The translation of MAT 10:35, "a poner al hijo contra su padre, a la hija contra su madre, a la nuera contra su suegra," generally captures the essence of the original Greek text while maintaining an accessible style for Spanish speakers. However, the phrase may lack the direct impact of the original and could lead to misunderstandings regarding the concept of division Jesus describes. Suggestions for improvement include adopting a more literal phrase such as "he venido a dividir" instead of "a poner" to enhance fidelity to the original text and better convey the seriousness of the message. Overall, the translation effectively communicates the intended meaning but could benefit from slight adjustments to enhance clarity and reverence.

**MAT 11:12**: _(Grade 85.8)_

**Source**:
> ἀπὸ δὲ τῶν ἡμερῶν Ἰωάννου τοῦ βαπτιστοῦ ἕως ἄρτι ἡ βασιλεία τῶν οὐρανῶν βιάζεται, καὶ βιασταὶ ἁρπάζουσιν αὐτήν.  (From the days of John the Baptist until now, the kingdom of heaven suffers violence, and the violent take it by force.)

**Translation**:
> Desde que Juan el Bautista comenzó a predicar hasta ahora, se ha combatido mucho contra el reino de los cielos, y los que son violentos luchan para acabar con él. (Since John the Baptist began to preach until now, there has been much struggle against the kingdom of heaven, and the violent are fighting to end it.)

**Combined Review**:
The translation of MAT 11:12 effectively communicates the original Greek text's essence in a modern Spanish that resonates well with a Latin American audience. The phrase "se ha combatido mucho contra el reino de los cielos" captures the notion of struggle and resistance towards the kingdom of heaven. However, the phrase "los que son violentos luchan para acabar con él" may introduce a misunderstanding as it could imply opposition rather than the intended meaning of a fervent pursuit of the kingdom. A more nuanced choice of wording that reflects an active engagement rather than hostility would enhance clarity and theological accuracy. Overall, while the translation maintains accessibility and modernity, it could benefit from refinements to better align with conservative interpretations and the original intent. Therefore, the translation is graded at 85.

> Καὶ προσελθόντες οἱ μαθηταὶ εἶπον αὐτῷ· διατί ἐν παραβολαῖς λαλεῖς αὐτοῖς;  
(And the disciples came and said to him, "Why do you speak to them in parables?")

**Translation**:
> Sus discípulos se le acercaron y le dijeron:  
> ―¿Por qué usas esos simbolismos tan difíciles de entender?  
("His disciples approached him and said, 'Why do you use those symbols that are so difficult to understand?')

### Combined Review Summary
The translation of MAT 13:10 is generally well-received, capturing the essence of the original Greek text while maintaining accessibility for modern Spanish speakers. Multiple reviews highlight that the phrase "simbolismos tan difíciles de entender" is not the most precise terminology. It has been suggested that using "parábolas" (parables) instead would better reflect the biblical context and the storytelling aspect of Jesus’ teaching. The concerns regarding informality in language indicate a preference for terminology that honors the depth and gravity of Jesus’ teachings. Overall, while the translation succeeds in clarity and relatability, refining specific terms could enhance fidelity to the original text and respect for the message.

> καὶ ἔφαγον πάντες καὶ ἐχορτάσθησαν, καὶ ἦραν τὸ περισσεῦον τῶν κλασμάτων δώδεκα κοφίνους πλήρεις.  
(Translation: And they all ate and were satisfied, and they took up twelve baskets full of the fragments.)  

**Translation**:  
> Nadie se quedó sin comer. ¡Y hasta sobraron doce cestas de comida,  
(Translation: No one was left without eating. And even twelve baskets of food remained.)  

**Combined Review** _(Overall Grade: 85)_:  
The translation of MAT 14:20 effectively communicates the miracle of Jesus feeding the multitude in a modern and accessible style suitable for Spanish-speaking audiences, particularly in Latin America. However, several reviews pointed out that the phrase "Nadie se quedó sin comer" does not fully capture the emphasis on the miraculous provision that is conveyed in the original text. A suggested improvement would be to use a phrasing like "Todos comieron hasta saciarse" (Everyone ate until they were satisfied) to better reflect the miracle's abundance and significance. Additionally, the expression "¡Y hasta sobraron doce cestas de comida!" might be perceived as informal, and adjusting it to something like "y recogieron doce cestas llenas de sobras" (and they took up twelve baskets full of leftovers) could enhance clarity and reverence. Overall, the translation is well done but could benefit from minor adjustments to ensure the fullness of the message is conveyed, aligning more closely with conservative interpretations of the passage.

**MAT 15:18**: _(Grade 85.8)_  

**Source**:  
> τὰ δὲ ἐκπορευόμενα ἐκ τοῦ στόματος ἐκ τῆς καρδίας ἐξέρχεται, κἀκεῖνα κοινοῖ τὸν ἄνθρωπον.  

**Translation**:  
> pero el mal hablar brota de la suciedad del corazón y corrompe a la persona que así habla. (but evil speech comes from the impurity of the heart and corrupts the person who speaks this way.)  

**Combined Review**:  
The translation of MAT 15:18 effectively conveys the core message regarding the connection between the heart and speech. While it is clear and accessible for Spanish speakers, certain phrases could benefit from more precise word choices to reflect the gravity of the original text better. Specifically, the term 'suciedad del corazón' (impurity of the heart) may lack the seriousness intended in traditional translations. Alternatives like 'maldad del corazón' (wickedness of the heart) or 'malicia' (malice) could enhance the theological depth. The expression 'mal hablar' (evil speech) might also be refined to something like 'los malos pensamientos' (evil thoughts) to align more closely with the biblical concept of inner purity over mere outward expression. Overall, the translation maintains its clarity and relevance, though minor adjustments could deepen its theological impact, achieving a strong engagement with the audience.

**Translation**:
> Pero cuando los labradores vieron que se acercaba, se dijeron: “Este no es nada menos que el heredero. Matémoslo y así nos quedaremos con la herencia”. (But when the farmers saw him coming, they said to themselves, "This is nothing less than the heir. Let us kill him and thus keep the inheritance for ourselves.")

**Combined Review**:
The translation of MAT 21:38 effectively captures the original meaning and is generally clear and modern, making it accessible to a Spanish-speaking audience, particularly in Latin America. While the use of contemporary expressions enhances engagement, certain phrases could be refined for greater theological clarity and alignment with a conservative Christian perspective. 

Specifically, changing 'este no es nada menos que el heredero' to a more respectful tone such as 'Este es el heredero' would better reflect the gravity of the context. Additionally, simplifying the phrase 'matémoslo y así nos quedaremos con la herencia' could maintain its original seriousness without losing its intent. The expression 'se dijeron' might be replaced with 'pensaron' or 'se dijeron entre ellos' for a more natural conversational tone. Overall, the translation is commendable but would benefit from minor adjustments to enhance both clarity and reverence for the text.

**MAT 22:2**: _(Grade 85.8)_  

**Source**:  
> ὡμοιώθη ἡ βασιλεία τῶν οὐρανῶν ἀνθρώπῳ βασιλεῖ, ὅστις ἐποίησε γάμους τῷ υἱῷ αὐτοῦ. (The kingdom of heaven is like a king who prepared a wedding feast for his son.)  

**Translation**:  
> «El reino de los cielos puede ilustrarse con el cuento de un rey que preparó un gran banquete en celebración de la boda de su hijo. (The kingdom of heaven can be illustrated by the story of a king who prepared a great banquet in celebration of his son's wedding.)  

**Combined Review** _(Average Grade 85.0)_: The translation of MAT 22:2 captures the essence of the original Greek text while aiming for modern accessibility for Spanish speakers. However, there are concerns regarding the use of the term "cuento" (story), which may imply a fictional narrative rather than the significant teaching of a parable. Suggestions include replacing "cuento" with terms like "parábola" or "historia" to better convey the reverence associated with biblical texts. Additionally, while the translation effectively communicates the message, the phrase "puede ilustrarse con" (can be illustrated by) might be reconsidered to maintain a more formal tone. Overall, the translation is engaging and aligns with the objective of accessibility, but a few adjustments could enhance its appropriateness from a conservative Christian perspective.

**MAT 22:6**: _(Grade 85.8)_

**Source**:
> οἱ δὲ λοιποὶ κρατήσαντες τοὺς δούλους αὐτοῦ ὕβρισαν καὶ ἀπέκτειναν. (But the rest seized his servants, insulted them, and killed them.)

**Translation**:
> y los otros tomaron a los mensajeros y, tras golpearlos y afrentarlos, los mataron. (and the others took the messengers and, after beating and insulting them, killed them.)

### Combined Review Summary:
The translation of MAT 22:6 effectively conveys the core message of the original Greek text, reflecting the serious nature of the rejection faced by the messengers. The modern Spanish phrasing is accessible for contemporary readers, especially in Latin America. However, there are several areas for potential improvement:

1. The term 'afrentarlos' may not fully capture the gravity of 'ὕβρισαν', which suggests a stronger connotation of insult or blasphemy. A more impactful alternative like 'humillarlos' could enhance clarity and accessibility.

2. The phrase 'tomaron a los mensajeros' could be revised to 'tomaron a los siervos' to align better with traditional biblical language and emphasize the servitude aspect, which holds significant weight in the context of this parable.

3. Overall, while the translation succeeds in being engaging and relatable, it should strive for a balance between modern accessibility and the formal tone typically associated with biblical texts. Emphasizing the serious consequences of the actions described can help convey the intended gravity of the scripture more effectively. Overall, this translation is commendable, with suggestions aimed at enhancing fidelity to the original message.

**MAT 22:16**: _(Grade 85.8)_

**Source**:
> καὶ ἀποστέλλουσιν αὐτῷ τοὺς μαθητὰς αὐτῶν μετὰ τῶν Ἡρῳδιανῶν λέγοντες· διδάσκαλε, οἴδαμεν ὅτι ἀληθὴς εἶ καὶ τὴν ὁδὸν τοῦ Θεοῦ ἐν ἀληθείᾳ διδάσκεις, καὶ οὐ μέλει σοι περὶ οὐδενός· οὐ γὰρ βλέπεις εἰς πρόσωπον ἀνθρώπων· (And they sent to him their disciples, along with the Herodians, saying, "Teacher, we know that you are true and teach the way of God in truth, and do not care about anyone's opinion, for you are not swayed by appearances.")

**Translation**:
> Decidieron enviar a algunos de sus hombres, juntamente con algunos herodianos, (They decided to send some of their men, along with some Herodians,)
> a formularle algunas preguntas. (to ask him some questions.)
> ―Señor —le dijeron—, sabemos que amas la verdad y que la enseñas sin miedo a las consecuencias. ("Teacher," they said, "we know that you love the truth and teach it without fear of the consequences.")

### Combined Review
The translation of MAT 22:16 successfully conveys the meaning of the original Greek text while maintaining a clear and respectful tone, which is essential for delivering the biblical message effectively. The use of modern Spanish makes the text accessible for contemporary readers, particularly in Latin America. However, multiple reviews suggest that minor refinements could enhance clarity and flow. Specific phrases such as "amigo mío" could be simplified to "amigo" to improve tone, and the footnote regarding the Herodians, while informative, may disrupt the flow of the translation. Additionally, phrases like "amar la verdad" might be perceived as less formal; aligning these with more traditional biblical language could better suit conservative Christian perspectives. Overall, the translation is commendable but could benefit from adjustments for conciseness, grammatical precision, and a more formal tone to align with reverent biblical presentation.

## MAT 22:35 (Grade 85.8)

**Source**:  
> καὶ ἐπηρώτησεν εἷς ἐξ αὐτῶν, νομικός, πειράζων αὐτὸν καὶ λέγων·  
(And one of them, a lawyer, asked him, testing him, and saying:)

**Translation**:  
> y se les ocurrió una nueva idea. Uno de ellos, abogado, preguntó a Jesús:  
(and they thought of a new idea. One of them, a lawyer, asked Jesus:)

### Combined Review:
The translation of MAT 22:35 successfully conveys the essence of the original text while ensuring accessibility for modern Spanish-speaking audiences. However, the phrase "y se les ocurrió una nueva idea" is perceived as informal and does not fully capture the intent behind the lawyer's question, which is to challenge Jesus. A more accurate and reverent translation would be "y uno de ellos, un abogado, le preguntó a Jesús". This adjustment would enhance the professionalism and gravity of the text, aligning better with the solemnity of the biblical context. Overall, while the translation is clear and modern, it could benefit from slight revisions to increase fidelity to the original phrasing and to more appropriately reflect the serious nature of the conversation.

**Source**:  
> τότε ἠγέρθησαν πᾶσαι αἱ παρθένοι ἐκεῖναι καὶ ἐκόσμησαν τὰς λαμπάδας αὐτῶν. (Then all those virgins arose and trimmed their lamps.)  

**Translation**:  
> Las muchachas saltaron a arreglar las lámparas, (The girls jumped to fix the lamps.)  

**Combined Review**:  
The translation of MAT 25:7 as "Las muchachas saltaron a arreglar las lámparas" effectively conveys the essence of the original Greek text, capturing the urgency and action described. However, the choice of the word "muchachas" (girls) may not fully reflect the dignity or formality appropriate for the characters in this biblical context. A term like "doncellas" (maidens) or "vírgenes" (virgins) would align better with traditional expectations, especially given the parable's wedding context. Additionally, while the phrase "saltaron a arreglar" (jumped to fix) conveys immediacy, it may carry an informal tone that could be refined to enhance its gravity and nuance. Overall, the translation is modern and accessible, resonating well with Latin American audiences but could benefit from a more formal tone to reflect the original context and message more faithfully.

(Translation: A woman approached him with an alabaster jar of very expensive perfume, and she poured it on his head while he was reclining.)

**Translation**:  
> Durante la cena, una mujer se le acercó con un frasco de un perfume costosísimo y se lo echó en la cabeza.  
(Translation: During dinner, a woman approached him with a jar of very expensive perfume and poured it on his head.)

**Combined Review**:  
The translation of MAT 26:7 is generally clear and captures the essence of the original Greek text well. It effectively employs modern and familiar Spanish, making it accessible to a broad audience, particularly Spanish speakers in Latin America. The phrase "con un frasco de un perfume costosísimo" successfully conveys the high value of the perfume. However, some minor adjustments are recommended for clarity and fluidity. The expression 'se le acercó' could be made more direct as 'una mujer se acercó a Él'. Additionally, 'costosísimo' may feel informal; alternatives like 'muy caro' could reflect the seriousness of the situation better. The phrase 'se lo echó en la cabeza' might lack the formality expected in biblical texts; a more fitting option like 'se lo vertió sobre la cabeza' could enhance the reverence and weight of the action described. Overall, this translation is strong but could benefit from these refinements.

**Source**:
> Τῇ δὲ πρώτῃ τῶν ἀζύμων προσῆλθον οἱ μαθηταὶ τῷ Ἰησοῦ λέγοντες αὐτῷ· ποῦ θέλεις ἑτοιμάσωμέν σοι φαγεῖν τὸ πάσχα; (On the first day of the Feast of Unleavened Bread, the disciples came to Jesus, saying to Him, "Where do You want us to prepare for You to eat the Passover?")

**Translation**:
> El primer día de las ceremonias pascuales en que los judíos se abstenían de comer pan con levadura, los discípulos le preguntaron a Jesús: (On the first day of the Passover ceremonies when the Jews abstained from eating bread with leaven, the disciples asked Jesus:)  
> ―¿Dónde quieres que preparemos la cena de Pascua? ("Where do You want us to prepare for You to eat the Passover?")

**Combined Review**:
The translation of MAT 26:17 is accurate and maintains the essential meaning of the original Greek text. While it effectively conveys the significance of the Passover preparations, there are several suggestions for improvement. The phrase "el primer día de las ceremonias pascuales en que los judíos se abstenían de comer pan con levadura" is considered cumbersome and could be simplified to enhance accessibility, such as rephrasing it to "cuando los judíos celebraban la Pascua." The term "cena de Pascua" could also be adjusted to simply "Pascua" for greater reverence and alignment with traditional Christian terminology. Overall, while the translation is modern and relatable for Spanish speakers in Latin America, incorporating these minor adjustments could enhance clarity, fluidity, and engagement with the text.

**Translation**:  
> Luego dijo a la turba:  
> ―¿Soy acaso un asesino tan peligroso que tienen que venir con espadas y palos a arrestarme? Todos estos días he estado enseñando en el templo y no me detuvieron.  

**Combined Review**:  
The translation of MAT 26:55 has been recognized as clear and engaging, successfully conveying the essence of the original text while being accessible to modern Spanish-speaking audiences. The phrase "¿Soy acaso un asesino tan peligroso que tienen que venir con espadas y palos a arrestarme?" effectively communicates Jesus' rhetorical question, highlighting His innocence amidst the violence of the arrest. However, the use of the term "asesino" may misrepresent the tone of the original scripture, as it implies a more casual questioning of authority rather than the solemnity of the situation. It has been suggested that a more direct translation, such as replacing "asesino" with "criminal" or utilizing the term "ladrón," might better preserve the gravity of the context and emphasize the disproportionate nature of the crowd's reaction. Overall, while the translation is effective in accessibility and relatability, some adjustments to the wording and tone could enhance its fidelity to the original intent of the Scripture.

> Cuando lo vieron, lo adoraron, aunque algunos no estaban completamente convencidos de que en realidad era Jesús.  
(When they saw him, they worshipped him; but some doubted.)  

### Combined Review:  
The translation of Matthew 28:17 effectively captures the essence of the original Greek text, portraying the reverence and worship the disciples exhibited upon seeing the risen Jesus. The use of 'lo adoraron' (they worshipped him) accurately reflects their act of worship. However, the additional phrase 'aunque algunos no estaban completamente convencidos de que en realidad era Jesús' (although some were not completely convinced that he was really Jesus) introduces ambiguity regarding the disciples' faith. This deviates from the original meaning of 'οἱ δὲ ἐδίστασαν' (but some doubted), which suggests hesitation rather than a lack of complete conviction. A more faithful translation, such as 'algunos dudaron' (some doubted) or 'algunos titubearon' (some hesitated), would maintain the reverence of the moment and avoid interpretive layers that could undermine the clear acknowledgment of Jesus' identity and authority from a conservative Christian perspective. Overall, while the translation is clear and accessible for modern Spanish speakers, slight adjustments are needed to enhance its fidelity to the original text and align with traditional interpretations of the scripture.

**MAT 8:11**: _(Grade 86.0)_

**Source**:
> λέγω δὲ ὑμῖν ὅτι πολλοὶ ἀπὸ ἀνατολῶν καὶ δυσμῶν ἥξουσι καὶ ἀνακλιθήσονται μετὰ Ἀβραὰμ καὶ Ἰσαὰκ καὶ Ἰακὼβ ἐν τῇ βασιλείᾳ τῶν οὐρανῶν,  
> ("And I say to you that many will come from the east and the west and will recline at table with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven.")

**Translation**:
> Óiganme lo que les digo: Muchos gentiles, al igual que este soldado romano, irán de todas partes del mundo a sentarse en el reino de los cielos con Abraham, Isaac y Jacob.  
> ("Listen to me: Many Gentiles, just like this Roman soldier, will come from all parts of the world to sit in the kingdom of heaven with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.")

**Combined Review**:  
The translation of MAT 8:11 is generally effective and captures the essence of the original Greek text while conveying the message of inclusion for Gentiles in the Kingdom of Heaven. However, several points for improvement were noted across the reviews. The phrase "Óiganme lo que les digo" might be too informal and not reflect the solemnity of the original message; a more straightforward phrasing like "les digo" may be more appropriate. The use of "gentiles" is correct but could be clarified for accessibility; using "los gentiles" may enhance formality. The phrase "al igual que este soldado romano" could suggest an inappropriate comparison and should be rephrased to better communicate the intended distinction. Overall, while the translation is modern and accessible, it can be refined for greater clarity and fidelity to the original text.

**MAT 13:15**: _(Grade 86.0)_

**Source**:
> ἐπαχύνθη γὰρ ἡ καρδία τοῦ λαοῦ τούτου, καὶ τοῖς ὠσὶ βαρέως ἤκουσαν, καὶ τοὺς ὀφθαλμοὺς αὐτῶν ἐκάμμυσαν, μήποτε ἴδωσι τοῖς ὀφθαλμοῖς καὶ τοῖς ὠσὶν ἀκούσωσι καὶ τῇ καρδίᾳ συνῶσι καὶ ἐπιστρέψωσι, καὶ ἰάσομαι αὐτούς.

**Translation**:
> porque tienen el corazón endurecido (for their heart has become dull), no oyen bien (they do not hear well) y tienen los ojos cerrados (and their eyes are closed). Por lo tanto (Therefore), no verán (they will not see) ni oirán (nor hear) ni entenderán (nor understand) ni se convertirán (nor turn) ni dejarán que yo los sane (nor will they let me heal them).

---

**Combined Review**: 
The translation of MAT 13:15 captures the essence of the original Greek text, effectively conveying the seriousness of the spiritual condition described. The phrase 'porque tienen el corazón endurecido' is well-translated and reflects the intended meaning of spiritual insensitivity. However, some reviewers suggest improvements in certain phrases for enhanced clarity and formality. The expression 'no oyen bien' may benefit from a more formal alternative, such as 'no oyen correctamente', to align with the reverent tone appropriate for the text. Additionally, the latter part of the translation, specifically 'y dejarán que yo los sane', could imply a passive approach to healing, which may not fully encapsulate the original's emphasis on the people's refusal of healing. Overall, the translation is strong in accessibility and engagement for Spanish speakers, particularly within a Latin American context, but minor adjustments in wording could enhance theological accuracy and reverence.

**MAT 21:7**: _(Grade 86.0)_

**Source**:
> ἤγαγον τὴν ὄνον καὶ τὸν πῶλον, καὶ ἐπέθηκαν ἐπάνω αὐτῶν τὰ ἱμάτια αὐτῶν, καὶ ἐπεκάθισεν ἐπάνω αὐτῶν. (They brought the donkey and the colt, and they laid their cloaks on them, and he sat on them.)

**Translation**:
> y poco después regresaron con los animales. Pusieron luego sus mantos encima del burrito para que Jesús se montara. (and a little later they returned with the animals. They put their cloaks on the donkey so that Jesus could ride.)

**Combined Review**: 
The translation of Matthew 21:7 effectively captures the essence of the original Greek text while maintaining clarity and accessibility for modern Spanish speakers. However, several reviewers noted that the phrase "poco después regresaron con los animales" could imply a delay that is not present in the original text. It would be more precise to use "los discípulos llevaron la burra y el burrito" to convey immediacy and adherence to the source material. Additionally, while the term "burrito" is relatable, it may be deemed informal in a conservative context; alternatives like "asno" or "potro" might be more appropriate. Lastly, although "mantos" works for visual context, using a more biblically resonant term could enhance the cultural significance. Overall, the translation is commendable and achieves its goal of engagement, yet minor adjustments for precision and formality would improve its fidelity to the original scripture.

**MAT 21:34**: _(Grade 86.0)_

**Source**:
> ὅτε δὲ ἤγγισεν ὁ καιρὸς τῶν καρπῶν, ἀπέστειλε τοὺς δούλους αὐτοῦ πρὸς τοὺς γεωργοὺς λαβεῖν τοὺς καρποὺς αὐτοῦ.  
 (When the time of the fruits approached, he sent his servants to the farmers to receive his fruits.)

**Translation**:
> Cuando se acercó el tiempo de la cosecha, envió a empleados suyos a recoger lo que le correspondía.  
 (When the time of the harvest approached, he sent his employees to collect what belonged to him.)

**Combined Review**:  
The translation of Matthew 21:34 is generally clear and effective in conveying the original meaning. The phrase "Cuando se acercó el tiempo de la cosecha, envió a empleados suyos a recoger lo que le correspondía" captures the essence of the parable, making it accessible for Spanish speakers. However, the use of the term "empleados" is viewed as less personal and more secular compared to terms like "siervos" (or "dólares") that would better reflect the biblical context of servanthood. This adjustment would preserve the cultural and theological implications of the original text. While the overall translation meets its objectives, refining the language choice to align with traditional biblical terminology would enhance its fidelity and reverence.

**MAT 23:18**: _(Grade 86.0)_

**Source**:
> καί· ὃς ἂν ὀμόσῃ ἐν τῷ θυσιαστηρίῳ, οὐδέν ἐστιν, ὃς δ᾽ ἂν ὀμόσῃ ἐν τῷ δώρῳ τῷ ἐπάνω αὐτοῦ, ὀφείλει. (And whoever swears by the altar, it is nothing, but whoever swears by the gift that is on it, is obligated.)

**Translation**:
> Y dicen que se puede jurar en vano por el altar, pero si se jura en vano por lo que está sobre el altar, lo condenan. (And they say that one can swear in vain by the altar, but if one swears in vain by what is on the altar, they are condemned.)

**Combined Review**: _(Grade 86.0)_
The translation of MAT 23:18 effectively captures the essence of the original Greek text, providing clarity and accessibility in modern Spanish for a Latin American audience. However, there are several areas for improvement. The phrase "se puede jurar en vano" has been noted as potentially too colloquial and may obscure the seriousness of making oaths. Suggested alternatives like "no cuenta" or "pueden jurar sin valor" might convey the gravity of the vows more effectively. The translation aligns well with the intended message about the importance of integrity in oaths related to religious practices, but there is a need for more explicit language that reflects conservative theological perspectives on the seriousness of vows before God. Overall, while the translation is commendable and meets its objectives, refinements in word choice and phrasing could enhance its theological precision and urgency.

**MAT 2:22**: _(Grade 86.3)_

**Source**:
> ἀκούσας δὲ ὅτι Ἀρχέλαος βασιλεύει ἐπὶ τῆς Ἰουδαίας ἀντὶ Ηρῴδου τοῦ πατρὸς αὐτοῦ, ἐφοβήθη ἐκεῖ ἀπελθεῖν· χρηματισθεὶς δὲ κατ᾽ ὄναρ ἀνεχώρησεν εἰς τὰ μέρη τῆς Γαλιλαίας,  
*(Hearing that Archelaus was reigning over Judea in place of his father Herod, he was afraid to go there; but being warned in a dream, he withdrew to the regions of Galilee)*

**Translation**:
> Luego Dios le indicó en sueños que fuera a Galilea;  
*(Then God indicated to him in dreams that he should go to Galilee;)*

**Combined Review**: The translation of MAT 2:22 effectively captures the essential meaning of the original Greek text and maintains clarity, modernity, and accessibility for Spanish speakers in Latin America. However, it has been noted that the phrase "Dios le indicó" could better reflect the strength of the original Greek term "χρηματισθεὶς" which implies a more direct instruction. Suggestions include using terms like "instruyó" or "mandó". Furthermore, the translation would benefit from specifying that Joseph was afraid to go there and from indicating that it was God speaking through a dream, which is an important detail in the original context. Although the translation is engaging and mostly faithful, these adjustments would enhance both clarity and fidelity to the source material. Overall, this translation is a solid effort, deserving a grade of around 86.3.

**MAT 5:5**: _(Grade 86.3)_

**Source**:
> μακάριοι οἱ πραεῖς, ὅτι αὐτοὶ κληρονομήσουσι τὴν γῆν.  (Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the earth.)

**Translation**:
> ¡Dichosos los mansos, porque el mundo entero les pertenecerá!  (Blessed are the meek, for the whole world will belong to them!)

**Combined Review**: The translation of Matthew 5:5, "¡Dichosos los mansos, porque el mundo entero les pertenecerá!" effectively conveys the essence of the original Greek text. However, the phrase "el mundo entero les pertenecerá" is not an accurate reflection of the original meaning, which emphasizes inheriting "the earth" rather than suggesting general ownership of the world. A more appropriate translation would be to use "heredarán la tierra" (they shall inherit the earth) to align with traditional scriptural language and ensure theological accuracy. The term "mansos" is acceptable in a modern context but may not fully capture the nuance of "gentle" or "meek." Overall, while the translation remains accessible and engaging for Spanish speakers, slight adjustments could enhance its fidelity to the original text's intended meaning. Therefore, the review concludes with a score of 85 for clarity and modern language use, with notes on improving precision in theological interpretation.

**MAT 8:24**: _(Grade 86.3)_

**Source**:  
> καὶ ἰδοὺ σεισμὸς μέγας ἐγένετο ἐν τῇ θαλάσσῃ, ὥστε τὸ πλοῖον καλύπτεσθαι ὑπὸ τῶν κυμάτων· αὐτὸς δὲ ἐκάθευδε.  
> (And behold, there arose a great storm in the sea, so that the boat was covered with waves; but he was asleep.)

**Translation**:  
> Durante la travesía se quedó dormido.  
> Poco después se levantó una tormenta tan violenta que las olas inundaban la barca.  
> (During the crossing, he fell asleep. Soon after, a violent storm arose, causing the waves to flood the boat.)

**Combined Review**: _(Grade 86.6)_  
The translation of MAT 8:24 is generally clear and accessible for contemporary Spanish-speaking audiences, effectively capturing the essence of the original Greek text. While the modern style resonates well with Latin American readers, there are areas for improvement to enhance the reverence and emotional depth of the narrative. Suggestions include adjusting phrases like "Durante la travesía se quedó dormido" to a more reverent form, and ensuring the dramatic tension of the storm and Jesus' calmness is vividly depicted. Additionally, minor changes to improve flow and accuracy, such as more directly stating that Jesus was asleep when the storm arose, could provide a clearer sequence of events. Overall, this is a commendable effort that meets its goal of making the scripture engaging and understandable, yet it allows for further refinement in expressiveness and fidelity to the biblical context.

**MAT 14:16**: _(Grade 86.3)_

**Source**:
> ὁ δὲ Ἰησοῦς εἶπεν αὐτοῖς· οὐ χρείαν ἔχουσιν ἀπελθεῖν· δότε αὐτοῖς ὑμεῖς φαγεῖν. (But Jesus said to them, "They do not need to go away. You give them something to eat.")

**Translation**:
> ―¿Por qué? (Why?)  
> —les respondió Jesús—. (Jesus answered them)  
> ¡Denles ustedes de comer! (Give them something to eat!)

**Combined Review**: The translation of MAT 14:16 effectively communicates the original message while maintaining a modern and accessible style suitable for Latin American Spanish speakers. While the directive "¡Denles ustedes de comer!" captures the essence of Jesus' command well, the opening phrase “¿Por qué?” (Why?) may create confusion by implying a questioning of the disciples rather than a straightforward response. It has been suggested that this could be revised to enhance clarity, potentially rephrasing it to "No necesitan irse; ustedes denles de comer" (They do not need to go away; you give them something to eat) for a more immediate impact. Additionally, improvements in punctuation and structure could provide greater clarity and align with traditional biblical translations that may be preferred by conservative Christian audiences. Overall, the translation is engaging and fulfills the objective of accessibility, though careful attention to phrasing and nuance is recommended for clarity.

**MAT 18:17**: _(Grade 86.3)_

**Source**:
> ἐὰν δὲ παρακούσῃ αὐτῶν, εἰπὲ τῇ ἐκκλησίᾳ· ἐὰν δὲ καὶ τῆς ἐκκλησίας παρακούσῃ, ἔστω σοι ὥσπερ ὁ ἐθνικὸς καὶ ὁ τελώνης.

**Translation**:
> Si se niega a escucharte, presenta el caso a la iglesia, y si esta se pronuncia a tu favor y tu hermano no acepta la recomendación de la iglesia, entonces la iglesia debe expulsarlo.  
(If he refuses to listen to them, tell it to the church; and if he refuses to listen even to the church, let him be to you as a Gentile and a tax collector.)

### Combined Review:
The translation of MAT 18:17 generally conveys the meaning of the original Greek text effectively, making it accessible to Spanish speakers in contemporary contexts. Reviews consistently praise the clarity of the translation, especially the phrase 'presenta el caso a la iglesia' which reflects community accountability. However, multiple reviewers pointed out that the phrase 'la iglesia debe expulsarlo' might be perceived as too harsh or lacking in the spirit of reconciliation that this scripture aims to convey. Suggestions were made to consider more pastoral language that emphasizes restoration rather than expulsion. Additionally, clarity regarding the church's role in upholding biblical principles without appearing to take sides was also noted. Overall, the translation is strong and aligns with conservative Christian interpretations but could benefit from minor adjustments in tone and phrasing for enhanced pastoral sensitivity and clarity.

> μὴ ἔχοντος δὲ αὐτοῦ ἀποδοῦναι ἐκέλευσεν αὐτὸν ὁ κύριος αὐτοῦ πραθῆναι καὶ τὴν γυναῖκα αὐτοῦ καὶ τὰ τέκνα καὶ πάντα ὅσα εἶχε, καὶ ἀποδοθῆναι. ("But since he could not pay, his master ordered him to be sold, and his wife and children and all that he had, and payment to be made.")

**Translation**:
> Como no podía pagarle, el rey ordenó que lo vendieran como esclavo, y también a su esposa, a sus hijos y sus posesiones. ("Since he could not pay, the king ordered that he be sold as a slave, along with his wife, his children, and his possessions.")

**Combined Review**:  
The translation of MAT 18:25 effectively conveys the original text's meaning, retaining the context of debt and consequences. It utilizes clear and accessible language for modern Spanish-speaking audiences. However, suggestions for improvement include:
1. Using a more precise term than 'esclavo' to better reflect servitude in this context, enhancing clarity regarding forgiveness and grace.
2. Adopting a slightly more formal structure in phrases to reflect the gravity of the situation, for instance, "el rey ordenó que fuera vendido como esclavo" instead of "que lo vendieran como esclavo."
3. Considering alternatives to the term 'cien millones de pesos' for 'μυρίων ταλάντων' to represent the biblical context of the enormous debt more accurately.
4. Ensuring the phrase 'todas sus posesiones' is more explicit as 'todas sus pertenencias' for better reflection of the original meaning.  

Overall, the translation is a strong effort toward accessibility but could benefit from minor adjustments to improve fidelity and formal tone, achieving a rating of 85 to 90 across individual reviews.

**MAT 18:31**: _(Grade 86.3)_  

**Source**:  
> ἰδόντες δὲ οἱ σύνδουλοι αὐτοῦ τὰ γενόμενα ἐλυπήθησαν σφόδρα, καὶ ἐλθόντες διεσάφησαν τῷ κυρίῳ ἑαυτῶν πάντα τὰ γενόμενα.  
(Seeing this, his fellow servants were very upset, and they went and reported to their lord all that had happened.)  

**Translation**:  
> Los amigos del encarcelado, entristecidos, acudieron al rey y le contaron lo sucedido.  
(Literal translation: The friends of the imprisoned one, saddened, went to the king and told him what happened.)  

**Combined Review**:  
The translation of MAT 18:31 is generally well-executed, effectively capturing the essence of the original Greek text while maintaining accessibility for modern Spanish speakers. The term "Los amigos del encarcelado" is viewed as too casual and informal for the context; alternatives such as "los compañeros" or "los siervos" are suggested to reflect the more serious tone and nature of the relationship indicated by the Greek word 'σύνδουλοι' (fellow servants). The emotional weight of the term "entristecidos" is acknowledged as appropriate, but there is a call for slight adjustments in vocabulary to enhance fidelity to the serious message of accountability and consequences reflected in the scripture. Overall, while the translation achieves its purpose and is understandable, refining the terminology would better align it with a conservative Christian perspective and the contextual nuances of the biblical narrative.

**MAT 20:27**: _(Grade 86.3)_

**Source**:
> καὶ ὃς ἐὰν θέλῃ ἐν ὑμῖν εἶναι πρῶτος, ἔσται ὑμῶν δοῦλος·  (And whoever wishes to be first among you must be your servant.)

**Translation**:
> y el que quiera ocupar el primer lugar en la lista de honor debe ser esclavo de los demás. (and whoever wants to be first must be a slave to all.)

**Combined Review** _(Grade 86)_:
The translation of MAT 20:27, "y el que quiera ocupar el primer lugar en la lista de honor debe ser esclavo de los demás," is generally accurate and effectively conveys the essence of Jesus' teaching on servanthood and humility in a modern and accessible way for Spanish speakers. However, the term "esclavo" (slave) might evoke strong negative connotations in contemporary contexts, potentially detracting from the intended message of service. Several reviewers suggested that alternatives such as "siervo" (servant) or "servidor" (server) could better resonate with audiences, particularly within conservative Christian frameworks that emphasize servitude as a form of humility. While the translation meets its objectives, slight adjustments in word choice could enhance relatability and engagement with the intended audience.

**Translation**:  
> Así se cumplió la antigua profecía: (Thus the ancient prophecy was fulfilled:)  

**Combined Review** _(Grade 85)_:
The translation of MAT 21:4, "Así se cumplió la antigua profecía:", effectively conveys the essence of the original Greek text and reflects a modern, accessible style that aligns well with the goal of engaging Spanish speakers. However, the term 'la antigua profecía' may lack specificity and reverence, with suggestions to refer to 'la profecía de Zacarías' or 'lo que fue dicho por el profeta' to provide clearer context. While the current phrasing communicates the fulfillment of prophecy, adding a direct reference to the specific prophet could enhance understanding and depth, especially for a conservative audience that values the continuity of biblical prophecies. Overall, the translation is strong but could be improved with minor adjustments to clarify the prophetic aspect.

**MAT 24:48**: _(Grade 86.3)_

**Source**:
> ἐὰν δὲ εἴπῃ ὁ κακὸς δοῦλος ἐκεῖνος ἐν τῇ καρδίᾳ αὐτοῦ, χρονίζει ὁ κύριός μου ἐλθεῖν, (If that evil servant says in his heart, 'My lord is delaying his coming,')

**Translation**:
> »Pero si son tan malvados que, creyendo que voy a tardar en venir, (But if they are so wicked that, believing I will delay in coming,)  

**Combined Review** _(Grade 86)_: The translation of MAT 24:48 generally captures the essence of the original Greek text while aiming for accessibility for modern Spanish speakers. Phrases like 'Pero si son tan malvados que, creyendo que voy a tardar en venir,' effectively convey the meaning but could be refined for a more formal tone, as traditionally expected in biblical translations. The use of 'malvados' aligns with conservative interpretations, yet phrases such as 'tan malvados' and 'creyendo que' could be seen as informal and may detract from the weightiness of the scripture. Suggestions for improvement include adopting a more traditional phrasing like 'si el siervo malo dijere en su corazón' to better reflect the seriousness and reverence for the text. Overall, the translation serves its purpose well, with clear language and effective engagement, but could benefit from a slight adjustment in tone and fidelity to the original wording.

**MAT 26:53**: _(Grade 86.3)_

**Source**:
> ἢ δοκεῖς ὅτι οὐ δύναμαι ἄρτι παρακαλέσαι τὸν πατέρα μου, καὶ παραστήσει μοι πλείους ἢ δώδεκα λεγεῶνας ἀγγέλων; (Or do you think that I cannot now pray to my Father, and He will send me more than twelve legions of angels?)

**Translation**:
> ¿No sabes que podría pedirle a mi Padre que me enviara doce mil ángeles y me los enviaría al instante? (Do you not know that I could ask my Father to send me twelve thousand angels, and He would send them immediately?)

**Combined Review** _(Average Grade: 86.3)_: The translation of MAT 26:53 effectively captures the essence of the original Greek text while making it accessible to a modern Spanish-speaking audience. The phrase, "¿No sabes que podría pedirle a mi Padre que me enviara doce mil ángeles y me los enviaría al instante?" conveys both the power of Jesus and the urgency of His situation. However, there is a consensus that the translation should retain the term "doce legiones" (twelve legions) instead of "doce mil ángeles" (twelve thousand angels) to preserve the theological significance and gravity of the message. The original term connects with Roman military context, suggesting authority and divine power. While the modern language choice is appropriate, emphasizing this aspect of authority is crucial from a conservative Christian perspective. Overall, it is a solid translation that meets the objective, with a recommendation for minor adjustments to enhance theological fidelity.

**MAT 27:50**: _(Grade 86.3)_

**Source**:
> ὁ δὲ Ἰησοῦς πάλιν κράξας φωνῇ μεγάλῃ ἀφῆκε τὸ πνεῦμα. (And Jesus cried out again with a loud voice and yielded up his spirit.)

**Translation**:
> Jesús habló de nuevo con voz muy fuerte, y murió. (Jesus spoke again with a very loud voice, and died.)

**Combined Review**: _(Grade 86.0)_
The translation of MAT 27:50 captures the essence of the original text but can be improved for greater accuracy and emotional weight. While the phrase "Jesús habló de nuevo con voz muy fuerte, y murió" conveys the overall meaning, it lacks the impactful rendering of Jesus 'crying out' which underscores the intensity and significance of His final moments. Suggestions such as using "Jesús gritó de nuevo con voz fuerte, y entregó su espíritu" (Jesus shouted again with a strong voice, and yielded up His spirit) provide a more direct and powerful connection to the original Greek. This would align better with traditional translations and conservative theological interpretations, emphasizing the dramatic nature of Jesus's sacrifice. Overall, while the translation is accessible to modern Spanish speakers, minor adjustments could enhance both its clarity and theological depth.

**Translation**:  
> De la misma manera que los segadores separan el trigo de la mala hierba y queman esta, en el fin del mundo  

**Combined Review** _(Average Grade 86.5)_:  
The translation of Matthew 13:40 effectively conveys the essential message of the original Greek text while maintaining clarity and accessibility for Spanish-speaking audiences. It uses modern language that resonates well with a Latin American context. However, there are suggestions for improvement:  
1. A more precise term than "mala hierba" (weeds) might enhance the formal tone of the passage.  
2. The phrase "en el fin del mundo" (at the end of the world) could be better expressed as "al final del mundo" for clarity.  
3. Including the action of sending angels, which is vital for the complete understanding of the parable's context, could strengthen the translation further.  
Overall, the translation is strong but could benefit from these minor adjustments to enhance theological nuances and ensure a full representation of the scriptural context.

 ("The Son of Man will send His angels, and they will gather out of His kingdom all things that offend and those who practice lawlessness.")

**Translation**:
> enviaré a mis ángeles a arrancar del reino a los que tientan a los demás y a los que hacen el mal.  
 ("I will send my angels to uproot from the kingdom those who tempt others and those who do evil.")

**Combined Review**:  
The translation of Matthew 13:41 is overall clear and modern, making it accessible for Spanish speakers, particularly in Latin America. It successfully conveys the core message of divine judgment central to a conservative Christian interpretation. However, there are concerns regarding the term "tientan," which may dilute the broader implications of the original Greek term "σκάνδαλα" (scandals). A more direct reference to scandals could enhance theological accuracy and clarity, ensuring it better reflects the seriousness of leading others into sin. Suggestions for minor adjustments include reinforcing the original text's focus on causing offenses and iniquity. While the translation is strong, enhancing fidelity to the source text would improve its overall impact.

**Translation**:
> ¿Son ustedes siervos sabios y fieles a quienes el Señor ha encomendado la tarea de realizar los quehaceres de su casa y proporcionar a sus hijos el alimento cotidiano? (Are you wise and faithful servants to whom the Lord has entrusted the task of managing the duties of His house and providing for His children the daily food?)

### Combined Review Summary
The translation of Matthew 24:45 generally captures the essence of the original text well, presenting a clear and modern interpretation that resonates with Spanish speakers in Latin America. The use of familiar language makes the scripture more accessible, aligning with the goal of engaging a contemporary audience. However, the phrase 'realizar los quehaceres de su casa' may be viewed as too colloquial and might better reflect the intended seriousness of the servant's responsibility with a more specific term such as 'cuidar de su casa' or 'darles la comida en su debido tiempo.' The term 'alimento cotidiano' could also be simplified to 'el alimento diario' to enhance relatability. Overall, while the translation is solid and effective, slight adjustments are recommended for greater precision and clarity.

**MAT 1:19**: _(Grade 86.7)_

**Source**:
> Ἰωσὴφ δὲ ὁ ἀνὴρ αὐτῆς, δίκαιος ὢν καὶ μὴ θέλων αὐτὴν παραδειγματίσαι, ἐβουλήθη λάθρα ἀπολῦσαι αὐτήν.  (Joseph her husband, being a just man, and not wanting to make her a public example, was minded to put her away secretly.)

**Translation**:
> José, su novio, como era un hombre recto, quiso romper el compromiso en secreto, para no manchar el buen nombre de la joven.  (Joseph, her betrothed, being a righteous man, was unwilling to expose her to public disgrace, and resolved to divorce her quietly.)

**Combined Review**:
The translation of Matthew 1:19 is generally well-executed, with a modern and accessible style that resonates well with Spanish-speaking audiences, especially in Latin America. The term 'novio' (betrothed) is appropriate for contemporary Spanish usage, but some reviews suggest that using 'esposo' (husband) may be more fitting in light of the cultural and legal implications of betrothal during biblical times. The phrase 'como era un hombre recto' (as he was a righteous man) successfully reflects Joseph's character and maintains a conservative perspective. However, minor adjustments could enhance clarity and biblical fidelity. For instance, replacing 'romper el compromiso' (to break the engagement) with 'divorciarse' (to divorce) could convey the seriousness of the situation better. The expression 'no manchar el buen nombre de la joven' (to not tarnish the young woman's good name) is respectful but may benefit from further clarification to ensure its theological implications are fully understood. Overall, the translation is solid, with room for improvements in terminology and clarity to align it more closely with conservative values.

> ἦλθε γὰρ Ἰωάννης μήτε ἐσθίων μήτε πίνων, καὶ λέγουσι· δαιμόνιον ἔχει. (For John came neither eating nor drinking, and they say, 'He has a demon.')  

**Translation**:  
> »Vino Juan el Bautista, que no toma vino ni come mucho, y ustedes dicen que está endemoniado. (John the Baptist came, neither drinking wine nor eating much, and you say he has a demon.)  

**Overall Review Summary**:  
The translation of MAT 11:18 is generally well executed, capturing the essence of the original text effectively for modern Spanish speakers. While the use of accessible language aligns with the goal of making the Bible more approachable, some phrases warrant reconsideration for clarity and precision. Specifically, the phrase "que no toma vino ni come mucho" could be improved to "que no come ni bebe" or another rendering that conveys the notion of abstinence more clearly without implying moderation. Additionally, altering "está endemoniado" to "tiene un demonio" might resonate more strongly within a conservative Christian context, enhancing both clarity and theological fidelity. Overall, the translation is solid but would benefit from minor adjustments to refine its accuracy and maintain the text's reverence.

**Source**:
> καὶ ἐξίσταντο πάντες οἱ ὄχλοι καὶ ἔλεγον· μήτι οὗτός ἐστιν ὁ Χριστὸς ὁ υἱὸς Δαυΐδ; (And all the crowds were amazed and said, "Is this not the Christ, the Son of David?")

**Translation**:
> La gente estaba maravillada. «¡Quizás Jesús es el Hijo de David!» —exclamaban. (The people were amazed. "Maybe Jesus is the Son of David!" they exclaimed.)

**Combined Review**: _(Overall Grade: 85.0)_
The translation of MAT 12:23 effectively conveys the amazement and speculation of the crowd about Jesus's identity as the Son of David, utilizing contemporary Spanish that is accessible to modern audiences. Phrases like "La gente estaba maravillada" accurately reflect the crowd's astonishment, maintaining the original context. However, the term "quizás" (maybe) may introduce uncertainty about Jesus' identity, which could mislead readers regarding their recognition of Him as the Messiah. Many reviewers suggest using a stronger phrase such as "¡Seguramente este es el Hijo de David!" (Surely this is the Son of David!) to enhance clarity and affirm Jesus' divinity. Overall, while the translation meets the objective of being accessible and modern, adjustments for theological accuracy would strengthen its alignment with conservative Christian perspectives.

**MAT 13:57**: _(Grade 86.7)_

**Source**:
> καὶ ἐσκανδαλίζοντο ἐν αὐτῷ. ὁ δὲ Ἰησοῦς εἶπεν αὐτοῖς· οὐκ ἔστι προφήτης ἄτιμος εἰ μὴ ἐν τῇ πατρίδι αὐτοῦ καὶ ἐν τῇ οἰκίᾳ αὐτοῦ.

**Translation**:
> Y terminaron enojándose con él. Entonces Jesús les dijo.
> ―Al profeta nunca lo aceptan en su propia tierra ni entre su propia gente.

**Overall Review**:
The translation of MAT 13:57 is generally accurate and captures the essence of the original text well, earning an overall grade of 85. The phrase 'Al profeta nunca lo aceptan en su propia tierra ni entre su propia gente' communicates the meaning effectively and maintains the cultural context of Jesus' statement. However, several reviews suggest improvements in the wording and nuance of certain phrases. 

Specifically, the use of 'enojándose' (angering) is noted as potentially informal and could be replaced with 'escanadalizándose' (being offended) to better reflect the original Greek's implication of scandal or offense. Additionally, some reviewers mentioned that the attribution 'Entonces Jesús les dijo.' could be inferred from context and might be streamlined for clarity. 

Despite these suggestions, the translation is commended for being modern and accessible to contemporary Spanish-speaking audiences, particularly in Latin America, thus aligning with the translation objective.

**MAT 17:26**: _(Grade 86.7)_

**Source**:
> λέγει αὐτῷ ὁ Πέτρος· ἀπὸ τῶν ἀλλοτρίων. ἔφη αὐτῷ ὁ Ἰησοῦς· ἄραγε ἐλεύθεροί εἰσιν οἱ υἱοί. (Peter said to Him, "From strangers." Jesus said to him, "Then the sons are free.")

**Translation**:
> ―A los extranjeros, claro —respondió Pedro. ("To the foreigners, of course," replied Peter.)

**Combined Review**:
The translation of MAT 17:26 captures the essence of the original Greek text effectively while maintaining a modern and accessible style suitable for Latin American audiences. While it generally meets the objectives of clarity and engagement, there are suggestions for improvement. Reviewers noted that the current translation, while clear, could benefit from additional context regarding the implications of Jesus' message about exemption from the temple tax, specifically the phrase ‘Then the sons are free’ which highlights the freedom believers have in relation to the law. Enhancements could include minor adjustments to enrich theological depth and ensure the significance of the dialogue resonates more strongly with conservative Christian beliefs. The translation's informal tone is appropriate for the target audience, aligning well with the aim of making biblical texts relatable and engaging.

**MAT 18:24**: _(Grade 86.7)_

**Source**:
> ἀρξαμένου δὲ αὐτοῦ συναίρειν προσηνέχθη αὐτῷ εἷς ὀφειλέτης μυρίων ταλάντων. (When he began to settle accounts, one who owed him ten thousand talents was brought to him.)

**Translation**:
> En el proceso, le trajeron a uno que le debía cien millones de pesos. (In the process, one was brought to him who owed him one hundred million pesos.)

**Combined Review**:
The translation of MAT 18:24 as "En el proceso, le trajeron a uno que le debía cien millones de pesos" is generally well executed and accessible for Spanish-speaking audiences, especially in Latin America. While the term "cien millones de pesos" effectively conveys a sense of the vast debt, it does not fully reflect the original Greek text's "ten thousand talents," which carries significant theological implications about debt and forgiveness. Although the modern monetary expression is relatable, it may detract from the verse's depth and the historical context of the biblical narrative. Reviewers noted that the phrase "En el proceso" could be simplified for clarity. Additionally, there is a suggestion to include a footnote to clarify the hyperbolic nature of the original debt, helping to bridge the cultural gap. Overall, the translation is engaging and suitable for its purpose but would benefit from minor adjustments to enhance both accuracy and understanding of the biblical context.

> λέγων αὐτοῖς· πορεύθητε εἰς τὴν κώμην τὴν ἀπέναντι ὑμῶν, καὶ εὐθέως εὑρήσετε ὄνον δεδεμένην καὶ πῶλον μετ᾽ αὐτῆς· λύσαντες ἀγάγετέ μοι.  

**Translation**:  
> A la entrada del pueblo les dijo:  
> «Hallarán una burra atada y junto a ella un burrito. Desátenlos y me los traen.  

**Combined Review**: _(Grade 86)_  
The translation of MAT 21:2 effectively conveys the essence of the original Greek text while remaining accessible to modern Spanish speakers. Phrases like 'burra atada' and 'junto a ella un burrito' are appropriate and relatable. However, the instruction 'Desátenlos y me los traen' could be revised to 'Desátenlos y tráiganmelos' for grammatical accuracy and clarity. Additionally, simplifying 'a la entrada del pueblo les dijo' could improve accessibility. Overall, the translation is solid and aligns well with conservative Christian values, maintaining fidelity to the text while striving for engagement.

**MAT 21:16**: _(Grade 86.7)_

**Source**:
> καὶ εἶπον αὐτῷ· ἀκούεις τί οὗτοι λέγουσιν; ὁ δὲ Ἰησοῦς λέγει αὐτοῖς· ναί· οὐδέποτε ἀνέγνωτε ὅτι ἐκ στόματος νηπίων καὶ θηλαζόντων κατηρτίσω αἶνον;  
(Translation: "And they said to Him, 'Do you hear what these are saying?' And Jesus said to them, 'Yes; have you never read, 'Out of the mouth of infants and nursing babies you have prepared praise'?" )

**Translation**:
> —¿No oyes lo que están diciendo esos niños?  
> —Sí —respondió Jesús—.  
> ¿No dicen acaso las Escrituras que “aun los recién nacidos lo adoran”?  
(Translation: "—Do you not hear what these children are saying? —Yes —Jesus replied—. Do the Scriptures not say that 'even the newborns praise Him'?" )

**Combined Review**: The translation of MAT 21:16 is generally well done and engages modern Spanish speakers effectively. While it conveys the essence of the original text, the phrase 'aun los recién nacidos lo adoran' presents a slight deviation from the intended meaning of the original Greek, which emphasizes 'praise' rather than 'adoration'. Reviews suggest that a more precise wording such as "de la boca de los niños y de los que maman, has establecido alabanzas" would better reflect the biblical intent of the scripture, specifically aligning with Psalm 8:2. Minor adjustments in phrasing could enhance clarity and theological accuracy, ensuring that the translation adheres closely to the original message of Jesus affirming the children's praise. Overall, while the translation is accessible and suitable for its audience, improvements in specificity and accuracy would be beneficial.

**MAT 21:35**: _(Grade 86.7)_

**Source**:  
> καὶ λαβόντες οἱ γεωργοὶ τοὺς δούλους αὐτοῦ ὃν μὲν ἔδειραν, ὃν δὲ ἀπέκτειναν, ὃν δὲ ἐλιθοβόλησαν. (And taking the servants of his, the farmers beat one, killed another, and stoned another.)  

**Translation**:  
> Pero los labradores los atacaron: a uno lo golpearon, a otro lo mataron y a otro lo apedrearon. (But the laborers attacked them: one they beat, another they killed, and another they stoned.)

**Combined Review** _(Grade 86)_:  
The translation of MAT 21:35 is generally accurate and maintains the original meaning of the Greek text. It is rendered in a modern and accessible style suitable for Spanish speakers in Latin America, which fulfills the objective of making the Bible engaging. The phrase "los labradores los atacaron" effectively communicates the aggressive actions of the laborers. However, it may be beneficial to consider alternatives like "maltrataron" or "agredieron" to convey a more serious tone. Some reviewers noted that "atacaron" could evoke connotations of excessive violence, which might not align with the intended seriousness of the biblical context. Overall, the translation successfully conveys the essential message and aligns with conservative Christian values, but slight adjustments in terminology could enhance both fidelity and clarity. Minor improvements regarding the translation's fluency and directness could further align it with the intended biblical gravity.

> ἐπιδείξατέ μοι τὸ νόμισμα τοῦ κήνσου. οἱ δὲ προσήνεγκαν αὐτῷ δηνάριον.  

**Translation**:  
> Jesús, que sabía lo que se traían entre manos, les dijo:  
> ―¡Hipócritas! ¿A quién se creen que están tratando de engañar con preguntas como esas? Enséñenme una moneda.  
> Y ellos le mostraron una moneda romana de plata.  

**Combined Review**: _(Average Grade 86.7)_  
The translation of Matthew 22:18-19 is generally effective, capturing the essence of the original Greek text and making it accessible to modern Spanish-speaking audiences. The use of contemporary language serves its purpose of clarity, especially with phrases like 'mostraron una moneda romana de plata' which provides cultural context. However, the term '¡Hipócritas!' has raised concerns regarding its strength, potentially detracting from a more reverent tone expected in biblical translations. Suggestions include moderating the tone to invite reflection rather than confrontation. Phrasing such as 'lo que se traían entre manos' might be considered too colloquial, thus adjustments are recommended for a broader conservative audience to enhance both reverence and engagement. Overall, the translation is commendable but would benefit from minor tweaks for clarity and formality.

**MAT 23:30**: _(Grade 86.7)_

**Source**:
> καὶ λέγετε· εἰ ἦμεν ἐν ταῖς ἡμέραις τῶν πατέρων ἡμῶν, οὐκ ἂν ἦμεν κοινωνοὶ αὐτῶν ἐν τῷ αἵματι τῶν προφητῶν. (And say: 'If we had been in the days of our fathers, we would not have been companions with them in the blood of the prophets.')

**Translation**:
> y al hacerlo dicen: “¡Nosotros no los habríamos matado!”. (And in doing so they say: "We would not have killed them!")

**Combined Review**: The translation of MAT 23:30 effectively conveys the original meaning in a clear and modern style suitable for Spanish speakers. The phrase "¡Nosotros no los habríamos matado!" successfully reflects the denial of complicity that the Pharisees exhibit. However, the translation could be enhanced by incorporating a more formal tone or emphasizing the gravity of Jesus' rebuke to better capture the hypocrisy of the Pharisees. While the current phrasing is relatable and engaging for contemporary audiences, slight adjustments to reflect the original text's emotional depth could improve its impact. Overall, it is a solid translation that fulfills the objectives of accessibility and alignment with conservative interpretations.

> ("And you will hear of wars and rumors of wars; see that you are not alarmed; for this must take place, but the end is not yet.")  

**Translation**:  
> Cuando oigan rumores de guerras, no crean que ya estarán señalando mi retorno; habrá rumores y habrá guerra, pero todavía no será el fin.  

**Combined Review** _(Grade 85)_: The translation of MAT 24:6 captures the essence of the original Greek text while maintaining clarity in modern Spanish. It effectively communicates the warning against misinterpreting signs of the end times. However, the phrase "no crean que ya estarán señalando mi retorno" could imply a certainty not present in the original Greek. A more precise wording could clarify that the wars mentioned are merely rumors and not indications of Christ's return, aligning better with traditional eschatological interpretations. Additionally, correcting "él fin" to "el fin" is necessary for grammatical accuracy. Overall, while the translation is engaging and accessible, minor adjustments are recommended for improved clarity and alignment with conservative Christian perspectives.

**Translation**:
> el Señor llegará cuando menos lo esperen (the Lord will arrive when they least expect it),

**Combined Review**: The translation of MAT 24:50 as "el Señor llegará cuando menos lo esperen" accurately captures the essence of the original Greek text, communicating the unexpected nature of the Lord's coming effectively. Reviewers noted that while the current translation is accessible and modern for Spanish speakers, there is a consensus that slight adjustments could enhance the urgency and seriousness conveyed in the original scripture. Suggestions include phrases such as "llegará en un momento inesperado" or "el Señor vendrá en el momento menos esperado" to reflect both the urgency and the gravity of the message. Overall, the translation meets the objective well but could be improved by incorporating these nuances to deepen theological precision and resonance with the intended audience.

> (For just as a man going on a journey called his own servants and entrusted to them his possessions)

**Translation**:
> »Hubo una vez un hombre que juntó a sus siervos; antes de partir hacia otro país, y les prestó dinero para que lo invirtieran en su nombre durante su ausencia.  
> (Once there was a man who gathered his servants; before departing for another country, he lent them money to invest in his name during his absence)

### Combined Review:
The translation of MAT 25:14 generally captures the essence of the original Greek text while maintaining clarity for Spanish-speaking audiences. However, several key areas need refinement for improved fidelity to the original. 

The phrase 'juntó a sus siervos' could be more accurately translated as 'llamó a sus siervos' (called his servants) to reflect the Greek 'ἐκάλεσε' better. Additionally, the term 'prestó dinero' (lent money) might lead to misinterpretation, as it implies a loan rather than the intended stewardship conveyed by the original Greek 'παρέδωκεν,' which would be better rendered as 'entregó' (delivered) or 'confió' (entrusted). The wording 'hacia otro país' could also be simplified for clarity. Overall, while the translation is accessible and relatable, these minor adjustments would enhance accuracy and preserve the solemnity of the original text.

> (And coming, the one who received the five talents brought another five talents, saying: Master, you delivered to me five talents; see, I have gained five more talents on them.)

**Translation**:  
> »El que había recibido los cincuenta mil pesos le entregó cien mil.  
> (The one who had received fifty thousand pesos handed over one hundred thousand.)

**Combined Review**:  
The translation of MAT 25:20 is generally effective in conveying the core message of the original biblical text while using modern and accessible Spanish for the Latin American audience. Most reviewers agree that while the use of 'cincuenta mil pesos' is relatable, it would be more accurate to retain the original term 'talents' to preserve the cultural and theological significance inherent in the parable. The phrase 'le entregó cien mil' is noted to oversimplify the original text, which explicitly refers to the concept of doubling the talents. Additionally, it would be beneficial to emphasize the servant's accountability to the master. Although the translation meets the objectives of engagement and comprehension, minor adjustments are recommended for greater fidelity to the original scripture, such as using more biblically appropriate terminology and slightly expanding phrases to capture the full nuance of the text. Overall, it reflects a solid effort with room for improvement.

**Translation**:
> Pero si lo hiciera, ¿cómo se cumplirían las Escrituras que describen lo que ahora mismo está aconteciendo? (But if I did, how would the Scriptures be fulfilled that describe what is currently happening?)

### Combined Review
The translation of MAT 26:54 captures the essential meaning of the original Greek text while using modern and accessible Spanish, making it suitable for a contemporary audience. However, several reviews suggested improvements for clarity. 

1. The phrase "lo hiciera" could be refined to "si yo hiciera eso" for clearer reference to Jesus. 
2. The expression "describen lo que ahora mismo está aconteciendo" could be simplified; options such as "dicen" or "hablan de" might enhance the flow, while shortening to something like "lo que está sucediendo" could also be effective. 

Overall, the translation effectively conveys the theological significance of the verse while maintaining an engaging style for Latin American readers. Minor adjustments are recommended to enhance clarity and fluidity, aligning well with conservative Christian beliefs about the importance of Scripture.

> καὶ πλέξαντες στέφανον ἐξ ἀκανθῶν ἐπέθηκαν ἐπὶ τὴν κεφαλὴν αὐτοῦ καὶ κάλαμον ἐπὶ τὴν δεξιὰν αὐτοῦ, καὶ γονυπετήσαντες ἔμπροσθεν αὐτοῦ ἐνέπαιζον αὐτῷ λέγοντες· χαῖρε ὁ βασιλεὺς τῶν Ἰουδαίων· (And they wove a crown of thorns and placed it on his head, and a reed in his right hand; and kneeling before him, they mocked him, saying, "Hail, King of the Jews!")

**Translation**:
> A alguien se le ocurrió ponerle una corona de espinas y una vara en la mano derecha a manera de cetro. Burlones, se arrodillaban ante él. (Someone thought to put a crown of thorns on him and a rod in his right hand like a scepter. They mocked him, kneeling before him.)
> —¡Viva el Rey de los judíos! —gritaban. ("Long live the King of the Jews!" they shouted.)

**Combined Review** _(Overall Grade: 86)_: The translation of MAT 27:29 generally conveys the intended message with clarity and accessibility for contemporary Spanish-speaking audiences. However, the phrase "A alguien se le ocurrió" could unintentionally trivialize the soldiers' deliberate actions; a more precise translation like "Le pusieron" would better reflect the intent and seriousness of the moment. Additionally, while the term "burlones" effectively indicates mockery, it might be more impactful to state that they "se arrodillaron burlándose de Él" to emphasize their derision. The expression "a manera de cetro" also warrants reconsideration to fully capture the mockery inherent in the original text. Overall, while the translation is effective and maintains theological significance, a few adjustments would enhance its precision and reverence towards the source material.

**MAT 27:65**: _(Grade 86.7)_  

**Source**:  
> ἔφη αὐτοῖς ὁ Πιλᾶτος· ἔχετε κουστωδίαν· ὑπάγετε ἀσφαλίσασθε ὡς οἴδατε.  

**Translation**:  
> ―Well, there you have a platoon of soldiers. Go and ensure that nothing abnormal happens.  

### Combined Review  
The translation of MAT 27:65 is effective in conveying the original meaning while remaining accessible for modern Spanish speakers. However, there are several recommendations for enhancing the formality and reverence of the text.  
1. The phrase "un pelotón de soldados" may be considered too informal for this sacred context. A more respectful term, such as "una guardia de soldados" or "un grupo de soldados," would better reflect the seriousness of Pilate's command.  
2. The expression "asegúrense de que nada anormal suceda" lacks directness and could lead to ambiguity. A more faithful rendering might be "asegúrense de que no suceda nada extraño" or "asegúrense de que no ocurra ningún incidente indebido" to preserve clarity and respect.  

Overall, while the translation is clear and understandable, implementing these adjustments will ensure the text maintains its solemnity and aligns more closely with conservative Christian values.

**Translation**:
> Mientras pensaba en esto se quedó dormido y un ángel se le apareció en sueños y le dijo:  
> «José, hijo de David, no temas casarte con María, porque el hijo que lleva en las entrañas lo concibió ella del Espíritu Santo.  

### Combined Review  
The translation of MAT 1:20 is mostly accurate, clearly conveying the meaning of the original Greek text for Spanish speakers. There are several minor grammatical issues that could enhance clarity and engagement. 

- The phrase "se quedó dormido" can be simplified to "durmió" to better reflect Joseph's intentional act of pondering, while maintaining the flow.  
- The phrase "el hijo que lleva en las entrañas" would be more naturally phrased as "el hijo que lleva en su vientre," aligning with both contemporary usage and traditional biblical language.  
- The phrase "lo concibió ella del Espíritu Santo" can be refined to "fue concebido por el Espíritu Santo" to enhance clarity about the divine nature of Jesus' conception, which is significant from a theological standpoint.  

Overall, the translation is a strong effort, effectively communicating the message while remaining accessible to a modern audience. With some minor adjustments for clarity and resonance, it could further align with conservative Christian values and traditions.

> ἀπὸ τῶν καρπῶν αὐτῶν ἐπιγνώσεσθε αὐτούς. μήτι συλλέγουσιν ἀπὸ ἀκανθῶν σταφυλὴν ἢ ἀπὸ τριβόλων σῦκα;

**Translation**:
> De la misma manera que uno puede identificar un árbol por los frutos que lleva, así podrán identificar a esos falsos profetas por la forma en que se comportan. ¿Quién confunde una vid con un espino o una higuera con abrojos? (In the same way that one can identify a tree by its fruits, so you will be able to identify those false prophets by how they behave. Who confuses a vine with a thorn or a fig tree with thistles?)

**Combined Review**: The translation of MAT 7:16 is generally effective in conveying the original meaning while maintaining accessibility for Spanish-speaking audiences. The core message regarding identifying false prophets by their behavior is clear and engaging. However, the phrase "¿Quién confunde una vid con un espino o una higuera con abrojos?" is seen as somewhat awkward and may detract from the clarity and directness of the message. It might be beneficial to simplify or rephrase this portion to align better with the rest of the translation's straightforward style. While the translation successfully preserves the theological essence and is modern, minor refinements to enhance clarity and reduce potential misunderstandings would be advantageous. Overall, it successfully engages a contemporary audience while remaining faithful to the original text.

(*"No one puts a patch of unshrunk cloth on an old garment; for the patch pulls away from the garment, and a worse tear results."*)

**Translation**:
> A nadie se le ocurre remendar un vestido viejo con una tela nueva, porque lo más probable es que la tela nueva se encoja y rompa la vieja, con lo cual la rotura se haría mayor.  
(*"No one would think of mending an old dress with a new piece of cloth, because it is likely that the new cloth will shrink and tear the old, making the tear worse."*)

**Combined Review** _(Overall Grade: 86.5)_:  
The translation of Matthew 9:16 effectively captures the essence of the original Greek text and makes the metaphor about not patching old garments with new cloth clear and accessible for Spanish speakers, particularly in Latin America. While the modern and conversational Spanish is appropriate for a contemporary audience, some reviews suggested minor adjustments for clarity and fluidity. Phrases like 'lo más probable es que la tela nueva se encoja' could be simplified to enhance understanding. Furthermore, emphasizing the spiritual implications of the metaphor may resonate more deeply with a conservative Christian audience, reinforcing the teaching's theological significance. Overall, the translation maintains fidelity to the original message while also being relatable, but there is room for improvement in terms of depth and accessibility.

**Translation**:  
> Cuando alguien le avisó a Jesús que su familia estaba fuera y quería hablarle (When someone informed Jesus that his family was outside and wanted to speak to him),  

**Combined Review** _(Grade 86.5)_:  
The translation of MAT 12:47 effectively conveys the meaning of the original Greek text, using modern and accessible Spanish suitable for Latin American audiences. It communicates the action of someone informing Jesus about his family wanting to speak with him, and the phrasing is generally clear and relatable. However, there are minor issues with fluidity and nuance, such as the urgency of the message and the contrast between spiritual and biological relationships, which could be more directly addressed. Although it maintains fidelity to the scripture and aligns with conservative Christian perspectives, slight improvements in structure and phrasing could enhance its overall readability and formality. Overall, the translation meets its objective well but has room for refinement.

**Translation**:

> «Un agricultor salió a sembrar sus semillas en el campo. Mientras lo hacía, algunas semillas cayeron en el camino, y las aves vinieron y se las comieron.  

**Combined Review**:
The translation of MAT 13:3-4 has generally been recognized for its clarity and engagement with contemporary Spanish-speaking audiences. While the use of 'simbolismos' effectively communicates a modern feel, several reviewers suggested replacing it with 'parábolas' or 'similitudes' to better align with biblical terminology and enhance clarity. Maintaining the original structure and directness of the source text is crucial; phrases like 'el sembrador salió a sembrar' should be more prominently featured to reflect the direct language of the Greek. While the translation succeeds in making the text accessible and relatable, there remains a consistent call for minor adjustments that would improve theological precision and fidelity to the original meaning. Overall, the translation is well-done but has room for refinement in terminology and alignment with traditional interpretations.

**Translation**:
> sintieron deseos de apresarlo, pero no se atrevieron porque el pueblo tenía a Jesús por profeta. (They felt a desire to seize him, but they did not dare because the people regarded Jesus as a prophet.)

### Combined Review
The translation of MAT 21:46 effectively conveys the original meaning while making the text accessible to contemporary Spanish speakers. However, several reviews noted that the phrase "sintieron deseos de apresarlo" could be interpreted as informal and vague, suggesting alternatives like "querían arrestarlo" or "deseaban" for clarity and seriousness. The overall message and urgency of the leaders' fear of the people and their view of Jesus as a prophet is well preserved. Although the translation maintains a modern touch, enhancing clarity and reverence in language is recommended for future translations. Overall, the translation achieves its goal of accessibility and relatability for the intended audience.

**Translation**:  
> “Amigo mío” (my friend), le dijo, “¿cómo entraste sin el vestido de boda?” (without the wedding garment?). Como no le respondió,  

**Combined Review**:  
The translation of MAT 22:12 is commendable, successfully conveying the original message in a clear and engaging modern style suitable for Spanish speakers. The choice of "Amigo mío" (my friend) is appropriate as it reflects warmth and familiarity, enhancing personal engagement. While the phrase “¿cómo entraste sin el vestido de boda?” (how did you enter without the wedding garment?) effectively communicates the gravity of the king's question, there is a suggestion to consider a more formal rendering of the term “vestido de boda” (wedding garment) to preserve the original's significance and symbolism. Overall, the translation is strong and meets the objectives of accessibility and engagement, though minor adjustments regarding tone and formality could enhance theological clarity and preserve the seriousness of the original text.

The translation of MAT 24:17 as "El que esté en la azotea, que no baje a hacer las maletas" effectively conveys the urgency and immediacy of Jesus' message, using modern and familiar language that resonates with contemporary Spanish speakers. Most reviews agree that while the phrase captures the essence of the original Greek text, the expression "hacer las maletas" might dilute the sense of urgency implied in the scripture. Suggestions for improvement include more direct phrases such as "no baje a buscar nada de su casa" or "no baje a recoger cosas" which could enhance clarity and better reflect the gravity of the instruction. Overall, the translation meets its objectives well but has opportunities for minor refinements.

**MAT 25:12**: _(Grade 86.8)_  

**Source**:  
> ὁ δὲ ἀποκριθεὶς εἶπεν· ἀμὴν λέγω ὑμῖν, οὐκ οἶδα ὑμᾶς.  
(Translation: But the bridegroom replied, 'Truly I say to you, I do not know you.')  

**Translation**:  
> Pero el novio les respondió: “¡No sé quiénes son ustedes! ¡Váyanse!”.  
(Translation: But the bridegroom answered them, 'I do not know who you are! Go away!')  

**Combined Review** _(Average Grade: 86.3)_:  
The translation of MAT 25:12 effectively conveys the essence of the original Greek text, communicating the bridegroom's message of rejection clearly in modern Spanish. The phrase '¡No sé quiénes son ustedes! ¡Váyanse!' captures the urgency and directness of the original context. However, the tone may benefit from being softened to reflect the love and grace characteristic of Christ's teachings. Alternative phrases like '¡Aléjense!' or '¡Retírense!' could present a gentler admonition while still maintaining the seriousness of the message. Additionally, using a more literal translation such as 'No los conozco' for 'I do not know you' could enhance the translation's authority. Overall, while the translation is accessible and relevant to a Latin American audience, slight refinements in tone and word choice could enhance its reverence and precision in line with conservative Christian interpretations.

**MAT 27:19**: _(Grade 86.8)_  

**Source**:  
> Καθημένου δὲ αὐτοῦ ἐπὶ τοῦ βήματος ἀπέστειλε πρὸς αὐτὸν ἡ γυνὴ αὐτοῦ λέγουσα· μηδὲν σοὶ καὶ τῷ δικαίῳ ἐκείνῳ· πολλὰ γὰρ ἔπαθον σήμερον κατ᾽ ὄναρ δι᾽ αὐτόν.  
(While he was sitting on the judgment seat, his wife sent to him, saying, “Have nothing to do with that righteous man, for I have suffered greatly in a dream because of him today.”)  

**Translation**:  
> Mientras Pilato presidía el tribunal, le llegó el siguiente mensaje de su esposa: «No te metas con ese hombre, porque anoche tuve una horrible pesadilla por culpa suya».  
(While Pilate was sitting on the judgment seat, his wife sent him a message saying, “Have nothing to do with that man, for I had a horrible nightmare because of him last night.”)  

**Combined Review**:  
The translation of MAT 27:19 is generally effective, clearly conveying the original meaning while employing modern and accessible language for Spanish-speaking audiences, particularly in Latin America. The phrase 'horrible pesadilla' appropriately reflects the seriousness of the dream experienced by Pilate's wife and aligns with a conservative view of the significance of prophetic warnings. While the overall clarity and impact of the translation are commendable, some reviewers suggested adjustments to enhance formality and precision in specific phrases. For instance, using 'justo' (righteous) instead of just referring to 'ese hombre' (that man) may help emphasize Jesus' character more strongly. Additionally, opting for alternatives to 'por culpa suya' (because of him) to avoid negative connotations could be beneficial. Overall, the translation is solid and remains faithful to the text, meeting the objectives of engaging modern audiences while preserving the scripture's intent.

**MAT 27:64**: _(Grade 86.8)_

**Source**:
> κέλευσον οὖν ἀσφαλισθῆναι τὸν τάφον ἕως τῆς τρίτης ἡμέρας, μήποτε ἐλθόντες οἱ μαθηταὶ αὐτοῦ νυκτὸς κλέψωσιν αὐτὸν καὶ εἴπωσι τῷ λαῷ, ἠγέρθη ἀπὸ τῶν νεκρῶν· καὶ ἔσται ἡ ἐσχάτη πλάνη χείρων τῆς πρώτης.

**Translation**:
> We would like you to order guards to be placed at the tomb until the third day, to prevent his disciples from coming and stealing the body and then saying to the people, 'He has risen from the dead.' If that happens, we will be worse off than before.

**Combined Review**: The translation of MAT 27:64 is generally well-executed and successfully conveys the original meaning while using modern, accessible Spanish suitable for Latin American readers. While the language is engaging, some reviewers suggested that certain phrases, such as 'se roben el cuerpo' and 'quisiéramos que ordenaras,' could benefit from more formal alternatives like 'sustraer' and 'queremos que ordenes' to enhance the seriousness of the biblical context. Additionally, clarity could be improved in phrases like "si eso sucede estaremos peor que antes," which may be rephrased for greater impact. Overall, the translation maintains the integrity of the biblical message and aligns with a conservative Christian perspective, though minor adjustments are recommended for increased clarity and formality.

**MAT 5:30**: _(Grade 87.0)_

**Source**:
> καὶ εἰ ἡ δεξιά σου χεὶρ σκανδαλίζει σε, ἔκκοψον αὐτὴν καὶ βάλε ἀπὸ σοῦ· συμφέρει γάρ σοι ἵνα ἀπόληται ἓν τῶν μελῶν σου καὶ μὴ ὅλον τὸ σῶμά σου βληθῇ εἰς γέενναν.  
(And if your right hand causes you to stumble, cut it off and throw it away; for it is better for you that one of your members perish, than for your whole body to be cast into hell.)  

**Translation**:
> Y si tu mano derecha te conduce al pecado, córtatela y échala lejos. Es mejor quedarse manco que ir al infierno.  
(And if your right hand causes you to stumble, cut it off and throw it away; for it is better for you that one of your members perish, than for your whole body to be cast into hell.)  

**Combined Review**:  
The translation of MAT 5:30 is generally clear and captures the urgency of Jesus's message regarding sin. It uses modern language that makes it accessible to contemporary Spanish speakers. However, the phrases 'córtatela y échala lejos' may come across as too casual and might not fully encapsulate the seriousness of the warning. While this translation aligns well with the objectives of accessibility and engagement, some reviewers suggest that terms like 'déjala' instead of 'échala lejos' could enhance the reverence and seriousness of the text. Overall, the translation is effective in conveying the core message, yet slight adjustments could improve its alignment with traditional conservative perspectives on the gravity of sin.

**MAT 13:22**: _(Grade 87.0)_  

**Source**:  
> ὁ δὲ εἰς τὰς ἀκάνθας σπαρείς, οὗτός ἐστιν ὁ τὸν λόγον ἀκούων, καὶ ἡ μέριμνα τοῦ αἰῶνος τούτου καὶ ἡ ἀπάτη τοῦ πλούτου συμπνίγει τὸν λόγον, καὶ ἄκαρπος γίνεται.  

**Translation**:  
> El terreno lleno de espinos es el corazón del que escucha el mensaje, pero se afana tanto en esta vida que el amor al dinero ahoga en él la Palabra de Dios, y cada vez trabaja menos para el Señor.  

**Combined Review**:  
The translation of MAT 13:22 successfully captures the core message of the original text, warning against worldly distractions and the deceitfulness of wealth. However, several reviewers noted that the phrase "cada vez trabaja menos para el Señor" could be interpreted as overly casual and detracts from the seriousness of the message. Suggestions included using alternatives like "y se vuelve estéril" to align more closely with a conservative Christian perspective and to better reflect the original Greek context. While the overall translation is clear and accessible for Latin American Spanish speakers, adjustments to improve formality and fidelity to the original text are recommended.

**MAT 26:70**: _(Grade 87.0)_  

**Source**:  
> ὁ δὲ ἠρνήσατο ἔμπροσθεν αὐτῶν πάντων λέγων· οὐκ οἶδα τί λέγεις. (But he denied it before them all, saying, I do not know what you are talking about.)  

**Translation**:  
> ―No sé de qué estás hablando —le respondió Pedro enojado. (I do not know what you are talking about, Peter replied angrily.)  

**Combined Review** _(Grade 86)_:  
The translation of MAT 26:70 is generally effective, capturing the essence of Peter's denial while using modern Spanish that resonates with Latin American audiences. The phrase "No sé de qué estás hablando" accurately conveys Peter's denial, aligning well with the original Greek. However, the use of "enojado" introduces an emotional tone that is not explicitly present in the original text. A more neutral expression could enhance the translation by avoiding the implication of anger, maintaining a straightforward and objective portrayal of Peter's response. While the translation is clear and accessible, minor adjustments in emotional language could improve its fidelity to the original context. Overall, the translation meets the accessibility goals well.

**MAT 3:6**: _(Grade 87.2)_

**Source**:
> καὶ ἐβαπτίζοντο ἐν τῷ Ἰορδάνῃ ὑπ᾽ αὐτοῦ ἐξομολογούμενοι τὰς ἁμαρτίας αὐτῶν. (And they were baptized in the Jordan by him, confessing their sins.)

**Translation**:
> A los que reconocían que eran pecadores, él los bautizaba en el río Jordán. (To those who recognized they were sinners, he baptized them in the Jordan River.)

**Combined Review** _(Grade 88.3)_: The translation of MAT 3:6 effectively captures the essence of the original Greek text and maintains clarity for modern Spanish speakers. While it is generally strong, several reviewers suggest enhancing the translation's alignment with the original intent of confession. Specifically, replacing 'reconocían que eran pecadores' with 'confesando sus pecados' would more accurately reflect the active acknowledgment of sins as indicated in the Greek. Additionally, explicitly mentioning 'él' (John) at the start of the sentence would provide clarity on who is performing the baptism. Overall, the translation is engaging and accessible but would benefit from slight adjustments to better convey the significance of confession and repentance, which are central themes in conservative Christian theology.

**Translation**:
> El Espíritu Santo condujo a Jesús al desierto para que el diablo lo tentara. (The Holy Spirit led Jesus into the wilderness to be tempted by the devil.)

**Combined Review** _(Grade 88)_:
The translation of Matthew 4:1 is generally clear and effectively captures the essence of the original Greek text. It accurately conveys that the Holy Spirit led Jesus into the wilderness for the purpose of being tempted by the devil, aligning well with conservative Christian interpretations. The modern Spanish used is accessible and familiar to Latin American audiences, fulfilling the objective of engaging the readers. However, there are suggestions for improvement: using "llevó" instead of "condujo" might reflect the nuance of direction and purpose more closely; and opting for "tentaciones" instead of "tentara" could enhance clarity and resonance with the concept of temptation. Additionally, ensuring reverent language that respects the sacred characters may strengthen the overall tone. Overall, the translation is strong, but minor adjustments could enhance precision and adherence to the original intent.

**Translation**:  
> »Los ojos son la lámpara del cuerpo. Si tu ojo es bondadoso, andarás en la luz; (The eyes are the lamp of the body. If your eye is good, you will walk in the light;)  

**Combined Review**: _(Grade 87)_  
The translation of Matthew 6:22 is generally accurate and conveys the original meaning effectively, particularly in its modern presentation for Spanish-speaking audiences. However, there are suggestions for improving clarity and theological depth. The phrase "Si tu ojo es bondadoso, andarás en la luz" can be enhanced; using "vivirás en la luz" or considering "ojo sano" (healthy eye) instead of "bondadoso" (good) might resonate more clearly with audiences, emphasizing the spiritual implications of clarity and generosity. While the translation captures the essence of the scripture well, these adjustments could deepen understanding and connection with the text. Overall, it successfully fulfills the goals of accessibility and engagement.

(Translation: Or how will you say to your brother, "Let me take the speck out of your eye," when there is a log in your own eye?)

**Translation**:  
> ¿Cómo le pedirás a tu amigo que te deje sacarle la paja que tiene en su ojo, si la viga que tienes en el tuyo no te deja ver?  
(Translation: How will you ask your friend to let you take the speck out of his eye, when the beam in your eye prevents you from seeing?)

**Combined Review**:  
The translation of MAT 7:4 is effective in conveying the metaphor and core message of self-examination before judging others. It utilizes modern and accessible language, making it relatable for Spanish speakers in Latin America. However, several reviews noted that the choice of 'amigo' could be revised to 'hermano' to reflect the original Greek term 'ἀδελφῷ,' which emphasizes community and familial relationships. Additionally, while the metaphor is clear, phrases like 'la viga que tienes en el tuyo no te deja ver' could benefit from further refinement for greater clarity and resonance with a conservative audience. Overall, the translation is strong but would improve with these minor adjustments for clarity and cultural relevance.

**MAT 9:3**: _(Grade 87.2)_

**Translation**:
> «¡Blasfemia!» —pensaron algunos de los maestros religiosos que lo oyeron. ("Blasphemy!" —thought some of the religious leaders who heard him.)

### Combined Review:
The translation of MAT 9:3 effectively captures the essence of the original text, clearly communicating the accusation of blasphemy by the scribes. The phrase "¡Blasfemia!" is appropriate, reflecting the severity of their thoughts and aligning well with the intent to engage Spanish-speaking audiences. However, several reviewers noted that the phrase "maestros religiosos" could be made more colloquial by using "líderes religiosos" for greater familiarity. Additionally, the translations lack a certain formality and reverence expected in a biblical context, which could be enhanced by adjusting wording to convey the gravity of the situation more effectively. Overall, while the translation is solid and accessible, incorporating a more traditional tone could enhance its impact for a conservative Christian audience. Suggestions include a direct phrasing like "algunos de los escribas pensaron en su corazón" to maintain the seriousness of the scriptural context.

(And you will have to appear before governors and kings for my sake. This will give them the opportunity to speak of me and to proclaim me before the world.)

**Combined Review**: 
The translation of MAT 10:18 is generally well-executed, with clarity and accessibility for Spanish speakers in mind. While it effectively conveys the original message and maintains the biblical context, some phrases, such as "Esto les brindará la oportunidad de hablarles de mí y de proclamarme ante el mundo" could be perceived as softening the gravity of the message regarding bearing witness. A more straightforward rendering, such as using "esto será un testimonio para" or "serán testigos ante ellos y ante los gentiles," may align more closely with the original Greek text's intent. Overall, while the translation resonates well with contemporary audiences, slight adjustments would enhance theological precision and maintain the seriousness of the original scripture.

**Translation**:
> »El reino de los cielos es como el pescador que tira la red al agua y recoge peces de todo tipo, buenos y malos. (The Kingdom of Heaven is like a fisherman who throws a net into the water and gathers fish of all kinds, both good and bad.)

**Combined Review**: The translation of MAT 13:47 is generally clear and effectively conveys the core message of the original text in a modern and accessible style for Latin American Spanish speakers. While the metaphor of the 'pescador' (fisherman) is appropriate, it could be beneficial to clarify that this represents Jesus or a figure from the Kingdom of Heaven to deepen understanding. The phrase 'peces de todo tipo, buenos y malos' (fish of all kinds, good and bad) could also be refined to emphasize the distinction between the righteous and the wicked more explicitly, which would enhance clarity. Overall, the translation fulfills its purpose well but leaves room for minor improvements in wording and contextual depth.
