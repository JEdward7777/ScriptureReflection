**MAT 23:2**: _(Grade 75.8)_

**Source**:  
> λέγων· ἐπὶ τῆς Μωσέως καθέδρας ἐκάθισαν οἱ γραμματεῖς καὶ οἱ Φαρισαῖοι.  
(Translation: Saying, "The scribes and the Pharisees sit on Moses' seat.")

**Translation**:  
> «¡Cualquiera que ve a estos escribas y fariseos creando leyes se creerá que son “Moisés en persona”!  
(Translation: "Anyone who sees these scribes and Pharisees creating laws will believe that they are 'Moses in person'!")

**Suggested Translation**:  
> «Los escribas y fariseos se han sentado en la silla de Moisés.»  
(Translation: "The scribes and Pharisees have sat on the seat of Moses.")

**Combined Review**:
The translation of MAT 23:2 generally seeks to make the biblical text accessible for modern Spanish speakers. However, multiple reviewers expressed concerns regarding the accuracy of the phrase "Cualquiera que ve a estos escribas y fariseos creando leyes se creerá que son 'Moisés en persona'" ("Anyone who sees these scribes and Pharisees creating laws will believe that they are 'Moses in person'"), which introduces an informal interpretation that detracts from the original Greek text's focus on the authority of the scribes and Pharisees sitting in Moses' seat, implying they create laws rather than simply holding a position of authority to teach the Law. A more conservative and literal translation, such as "los escribas y fariseos han tomado asiento en la cátedra de Moisés" ("the scribes and Pharisees have taken their seat in the chair of Moses"), would better reflect the serious nature of Jesus' teaching and the intended reverence of the original scripture. Overall, while the translation attempts to engage a Latin American audience, it requires adjustments to maintain theological integrity and accurately convey the essence of the biblical message.

**MAT 22:3**: _(Grade 78.3)_

**Source**:  
> καὶ ἀπέστειλε τοὺς δούλους αὐτοῦ καλέσαι τοὺς κεκλημένους εἰς τοὺς γάμους, καὶ οὐκ ἤθελον ἐλθεῖν. (And he sent his servants to call those who were invited to the wedding, but they did not want to come.)  

**Translation**:  
> Envió muchísimas invitaciones, y cuando el banquete estuvo listo, mandó un mensajero a notificar a los convidados que ya podían ir. ¡Pero nadie fue! (He sent many invitations, and when the banquet was ready, he sent a messenger to notify the guests that they could go. But nobody went!)  

**Suggested Translation**:  
> «Envió a sus siervos a invitar a los que estaban invitados a la boda, pero no quisieron venir.» (He sent his servants to invite those who were invited to the wedding, but they did not want to come.)  

**Combined Review**:
The translation of MAT 22:3 demonstrates a commendable effort to make the biblical text accessible for contemporary Spanish-speaking audiences, particularly in Latin America. However, several reviewers noted that the phrase "Envió muchísimas invitaciones" (He sent many invitations) strays from the original Greek text, which emphasizes the singular invitation extended by the king rather than a multitude. Additionally, the expression "¡Pero nadie fue!" (But nobody went!) may oversimplify the serious implications of the invited guests' rejection, which could be better captured with a more literal rendering like "no quisieron venir" (they did not want to come). The reviews collectively highlight the need for a balance between modern language accessibility and fidelity to the original scripture's meaning and weight. While the intent to engage the audience is evident, striving for precision and maintaining the gravity of the message is crucial. The translation is effective overall but has room for improvement in accurately reflecting the original text's nuances.

**MAT 10:34**: _(Grade 79.2)_

**Source**:
> Μὴ νομίσητε ὅτι ἦλθον βαλεῖν εἰρήνην ἐπὶ τὴν γῆν· οὐκ ἦλθον βαλεῖν εἰρήνην, ἀλλὰ μάχαιραν.  
(Matthew 10:34: "Do not think that I have come to bring peace to the earth; I have not come to bring peace, but a sword.")

**Translation**:
> No crean que vine a traer paz a la tierra. ¡Vine a traer guerras!;  
(Don't think that I came to bring peace to the earth. I came to bring wars!)

**Suggested Translation**:
> No piensen que he venido a traer paz a la tierra; no he venido a traer paz, sino división.  
(Don't think that I have come to bring peace to the earth; I have not come to bring peace, but division.)

**Combined Review**:
The translation of MAT 10:34 generally reflects the original Greek text, but it faces criticism primarily for the use of the term 'guerras' (wars). Multiple reviewers note that this word does not accurately convey the metaphorical implications of the original Greek word 'μάχαιραν' (sword), which signifies division and conflict rather than literal warfare. The suggestion to use 'división' (division) or 'espada' (sword) aligns better with the intention of Jesus' message about the cost of discipleship and the potential for division among families due to loyalty to Him. While the translation is modern and accessible, careful consideration of word choice is essential to preserve theological meaning and clarity. Overall, the translation captures the provocative nature of Christ's statement but could be improved for precision and fidelity to the biblical context.

**MAT 23:14**: _(Grade 79.2)_

**Source**:
> Οὐαὶ ὑμῖν, γραμματεῖς καὶ Φαρισαῖοι ὑποκριταί, ὅτι κλείετε τὴν βασιλείαν τῶν οὐρανῶν ἔμπροσθεν τῶν ἀνθρώπων· ὑμεῖς γὰρ οὐκ εἰσέρχεσθε, οὐδὲ τοὺς εἰσερχομένους ἀφίετε εἰσελθεῖν. (Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you shut the kingdom of heaven against men; for you neither enter yourselves, nor allow those who would enter to go in.)

**Translation**:
> ¡Ay de ustedes, escribas y fariseos hipócritas, que por un lado hacen oraciones larguísimas en las calles y por el otro les roban las casas a las viudas! ¡Hipócritas! (Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you make long prayers at length while robbing widows' houses!)

**Suggested Translation**:
> ¡Ay de ustedes, escribas y fariseos hipócritas, que cierran la puerta del reino de los cielos delante de los hombres! Porque ustedes no entran, ni dejan entrar a los que quieren. (Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you shut the door of the kingdom of heaven in people's faces; you neither enter yourselves nor allow those who would enter to go in.)

**Combined Review**:
The translation of MAT 23:14 effectively conveys the essence and condemnation of hypocrisy among the religious leaders. However, the phrase about making long prayers and the reference to robbing widows introduces implications not present in the original Greek text. Multiple reviewers highlighted that this deviates from the core message, which focuses on closing the kingdom of heaven to others. The recommendations include rephrasing to better align with the original meaning, emphasizing the shutting of the kingdom rather than adding accusations not stated in the source. Overall, while the style is modern and accessible, there is a significant need for greater fidelity to the original scripture's intent, affecting clarity and accuracy.

**MAT 24:34**: _(Grade 79.2)_

**Source**:
> ἀμὴν λέγω ὑμῖν, οὐ μὴ παρέλθῃ ἡ γενεὰ αὕτη ἕως ἂν πάντα ταῦτα γένηται. (Amen, I say to you, this generation will not pass away until all these things take place.)

**Translation**:
> Sólo entonces terminará esta era de maldad. (Only then will this era of wickedness end.)

**Suggested Translation**:
> Esta generación no pasará hasta que todas estas cosas sucedan. (This generation will not pass away until all these things happen.)

**Combined Review**:
The translation of MAT 24:34, "Sólo entonces terminará esta era de maldad" (Only then will this era of wickedness end), presents a clear and accessible message for Spanish speakers, yet it does not accurately reflect the original Greek meaning, which emphasizes that 'this generation' will not pass away until all these events occur. The phrase 'era de maldad' (era of wickedness) suggests a broader interpretation that diverges from the specific context of Jesus' audience, potentially leading to misunderstandings regarding His intent and the eschatological context. A more faithful translation would be: "Esta generación no pasará hasta que todas estas cosas sucedan" (This generation will not pass away until all these things happen), which aligns with conservative interpretations and preserves the urgency and finality of Christ's words. Overall, while the translation achieves a modern tone, minor adjustments are necessary to ensure fidelity to the original text.

**MAT 10:9**: _(Grade 80.8)_

**Source**:  
> μὴ κτήσησθε χρυσὸν μηδὲ ἄργυρον μηδὲ χαλκὸν εἰς τὰς ζώνας ὑμῶν,  
(Do not acquire gold, silver, or bronze for your belts.)

**Translation**:  
> No lleven dinero  
(No carry money)

**Suggested Translation**:  
> «No adquieran oro, plata ni bronce para llevar en sus cinturones.»  
("Do not acquire gold, silver, or bronze to carry in your belts.")

**Combined Review**:
The translation "No lleven dinero" (No carry money) is a direct and clear representation of the original Greek text, but it lacks completeness by not specifying the types of currency Jesus instructs not to carry: gold, silver, or bronze. Although it effectively communicates the basic message in a modern and accessible way, it would benefit from including a more comprehensive translation that captures the full directive. Several reviews suggest enhancing the translation by using terms that reflect ownership and preparation rather than merely physical carrying. Additionally, maintaining a tone that emphasizes the seriousness and authority of Jesus' command could enrich the reader's understanding and experience. Overall, while the current translation is clear and aligns with the goal of making the Bible accessible to Spanish speakers, it would be improved by incorporating greater detail and specificity.

**MAT 18:32**: _(Grade 81.7)_

**Source**:
> τότε προσκαλεσάμενος αὐτὸν ὁ κύριος αὐτοῦ λέγει αὐτῷ· δοῦλε πονηρέ, πᾶσαν τὴν ὀφειλὴν ἐκείνην ἀφῆκά σοι, ἐπεὶ παρεκάλεσάς με.  
(Then his lord called him and said to him, 'O wicked servant! I forgave you all that debt because you begged me.')

**Translation**:
> El rey, sin pérdida de tiempo, mandó llamar al hombre al que había perdonado. “¡Malvado! ¡Perverso!”, le dijo. “¡Así que yo te perdoné aquella inmensa deuda porque me lo pediste,  
(The king, without wasting time, called the man whom he had forgiven. "Wicked! Perverse!" he said to him. "So I forgave you that immense debt because you begged me,)

**Suggested Translation**:
> "El rey, al llamarlo, le dijo: 'Siervo negligente, te perdoné toda esa enorme deuda porque me lo pediste sinceramente. ¿No debías tú también tener compasión de tu compañero?"  
("The king, upon calling him, said: 'Negligent servant, I forgave you all that enormous debt because you sincerely asked me. Shouldn't you also have compassion on your fellow?"

**Combined Review**:
The translation of Matthew 18:32 captures the core message effectively for a modern Spanish-speaking audience. However, the phrases "¡Malvado! ¡Perverso!" ("Wicked! Perverse!") may be perceived as overly harsh and informal, potentially detracting from the seriousness of the biblical lesson on mercy and forgiveness. A more faithful rendering could involve using stronger terms like "¡Malvado! ¡Desgraciado!" ("Wicked! Wretched!") to reflect the gravity of the king's condemnation. The phrase "porque me lo pediste" ("because you begged me") could also be adjusted for formality and fluency, as it might dilute the original context of supplication. Overall, while the translation is accessible and clear, minor refinements in tone and word choice would enhance its alignment with conservative Christian interpretations and better convey the message of forgiveness.

**MAT 23:5**: _(Grade 81.7)_

**Source**:
> πάντα δὲ τὰ ἔργα αὐτῶν ποιοῦσι πρὸς τὸ θεαθῆναι τοῖς ἀνθρώποις. πλατύνουσι γὰρ τὰ φυλακτήρια αὐτῶν καὶ μεγαλύνουσι τὰ κράσπεδα τῶν ἱματίων αὐτῶν,  
> ("But all their works they do to be seen by men. They make their phylacteries broad and enlarge the borders of their garments.")

**Translation**:
> »¡Y luego se dedican a hacer obras de caridad para que los demás los vean! Para aparentar santidad, se ponen en la frente y en los brazos porciones de las Escrituras escritas en las tiras de pergamino o piel más anchas que puedan encontrar, y procuran que los flecos de sus mantos sean más largos que los de los demás.  
> ("And then they dedicate themselves to doing charitable works so that others may see them! To appear holy, they wear on their foreheads and arms portions of the Scriptures written on the widest strips of parchment or leather they can find, and they try to make the fringes of their garments longer than those of others.")

**Suggested Translation**:
> »Todo lo que hacen, lo hacen para ser vistos por los demás. Ampliarán las cajas de las Escrituras que llevan en la frente y en los brazos, y alargarán los flecos de sus mantos, buscando la aprobación de la gente.  
> ("Everything they do, they do to be seen by others. They will enlarge the boxes of Scriptures they wear on their foreheads and arms, and they will lengthen the fringes of their garments, seeking the approval of people.")

**Combined Review**:
Summary:
The translation of MAT 23:5 has received mixed feedback from reviewers. While it captures the essence of Jesus' rebuke toward the Pharisees and presents the content in a clear and engaging manner, several reviewers expressed concerns regarding its accuracy and theological fidelity. The phrase "obras de caridad" (charitable works) does not fully encapsulate the broader meaning of "έργα" (works) in the original Greek, which includes all deeds rather than being limited to charity. Additionally, phrases like "aparentar santidad" (to appear holy) may undermine the seriousness of the original text. It is recommended to use terminology such as "buenas obras" (good works) or "actos de justicia" (acts of justice) to better reflect the original intent. Reviewers also noted that terms like "porciones de las Escrituras" (portions of the Scriptures) could be clarified to specify "escrituras en tiras de pergamino" (scriptures on strips of parchment) for better accuracy. While the modern tone is appreciated for accessibility, achieving a balance between contemporary language and the reverence due to scripture remains crucial. Refining certain phrases and ensuring clarity could significantly enhance the translation's effectiveness.

**MAT 27:30**: _(Grade 81.7)_

**Source**:
> καὶ ἐμπτύσαντες εἰς αὐτὸν ἔλαβον τὸν κάλαμον καὶ ἔτυπτον εἰς τὴν κεφαλὴν αὐτοῦ. (And they spat on him, and took the staff, and struck him on the head.)

**Translation**:
> A veces lo escupían o le quitaban la vara y lo golpeaban con ella en la cabeza. (Sometimes they spat on him or took the staff and hit him on the head.)

**Suggested Translation**:
> Le escupieron, tomaron el cetro y lo golpeaban en la cabeza. (They spat on him, took the staff, and struck him on the head.)

**Combined Review**:
The translation of MAT 27:30 effectively conveys the original Greek text's essence, maintaining clarity and accessibility for contemporary Spanish-speaking audiences. However, the phrase "A veces lo escupían" (sometimes they spat on him) could imply a casualness that undermines the brutality of the scene. Reviews suggest that a more direct approach, such as "Le escupieron" (they spat on him), would enhance the translation's impact and better reflect the severity of the actions described. Overall, while the translation meets the objectives of accessibility, it requires slight adjustments to improve fidelity to the original text and emotional tone, making it more resonant for readers with a conservative Christian perspective.

**Source**:
> καὶ οὐκ ἐγίνωσκεν αὐτὴν ἕως οὗ ἔτεκε τὸν υἱὸν αὐτῆς τὸν πρωτότοκον, καὶ ἐκάλεσε τὸ ὄνομα αὐτοῦ Ἰησοῦν. (And he did not know her until she had given birth to her firstborn son; and he named him Jesus.)

**Translation**:
> aunque no tuvo relaciones sexuales con ella hasta que nació su hijo. Cuando el niño nació, José lo llamó Jesús. (although he did not have sexual relations with her until she gave birth to her son. When the boy was born, Joseph named him Jesus.)

**Suggested Translation**:
> y no la conoció hasta que nació su hijo, y cuando nació su hijo, José le puso por nombre Jesús. (and he did not know her until she had given birth to her son, and when her son was born, Joseph named him Jesus.)

**Combined Review**:
The translation of MAT 1:25 successfully conveys the essential meaning of the original text, presenting it clearly for modern readers. However, the phrase "no tuvo relaciones sexuales con ella" (he did not have sexual relations with her) may be considered overly explicit for a conservative Christian audience, detracting from the reverence expected in biblical translations. A preferred wording could be "no la conoció" (he did not know her), which serves as a more respectful euphemism for intimate relations. Additionally, while the overall structure of the translation is effective and clear, the tone could benefit from being softened in certain areas to align better with conservative sensitivities. Overall, the translation is good but could use minor adjustments to enhance its appropriateness for a conservative Christian context.

**MAT 13:51**: _(Grade 83.3)_

**Source**:
> Λέγει αὐτοῖς ὁ Ἰησοῦς· συνήκατε ταῦτα πάντα; λέγουσιν αὐτῷ, ναί, Κύριε. (Jesus said to them, "Do you understand all these things?" They said to him, "Yes, Lord.")

**Translation**:
> ¿Entienden ahora? —Sí —contestaron—. Gracias. (Do you understand now? —Yes —they answered—. Thank you.)

**Suggested Translation**:
> ¿Entienden ahora? —Sí, Señor —respondieron. (Do you understand now? —Yes, Lord —they answered.)

**Combined Review**:
The translation of MAT 13:51 largely conveys the essence of the original Greek text and employs a modern and accessible style suitable for Latin American Spanish speakers. The rhetorical question, '¿Entienden ahora?' (Do you understand now?) effectively reflects Jesus' intent, while the initial response '―Sí —contestaron—.' (Yes —they answered—.) is appropriate. However, the inclusion of 'Gracias' (Thank you) at the end detracts from the solemnity and authority expected in a biblical context. A more fitting conclusion would emphasize acknowledgment and reverence, such as 'Sí, Señor.' (Yes, Lord.) Overall, while the translation captures the core meaning and is engaging, adjustments are recommended to ensure it aligns more closely with the traditional biblical tone.

**MAT 15:15**: _(Grade 83.3)_

**Source**:
> ἀποκριθεὶς δὲ ὁ Πέτρος εἶπεν αὐτῷ· φράσον ἡμῖν τὴν παραβολὴν ταύτην. (And Peter answered him, "Explain this parable to us.")

**Translation**:
> Pedro le pidió que les explicara aquello de que comer los alimentos que la ley judía prohíbe no es lo que contamina al hombre. (Peter asked him to explain to them that eating foods that the Jewish law prohibits is not what defiles a person.)

**Suggested Translation**:
> Pedro le dijo: «Señor, ¿puedes explicarnos esta parábola sobre lo que realmente contamina al ser humano?» (Peter said to him: "Lord, can you explain this parable about what truly defiles a human being?")

**Combined Review**:
The translation of MAT 15:15 has garnered mixed feedback, highlighting both its strengths and areas for improvement. Many reviewers commend the translation for its clarity and accessibility to modern Spanish speakers, noting that it effectively captures the essence of Peter's inquiry. However, there is a consensus that the translation might be overly focused on dietary laws, which detracts from the deeper spiritual implications of Jesus' message regarding inner purity versus external traditions.

Several reviewers point out that the phrase "no es lo que contamina al hombre" (is not what defiles a person) could lead to misunderstanding, as it suggests a focus on dietary restrictions rather than reflecting Peter's request for clarification about a parable. A more faithful rendering of the source text is recommended to better align with the original inquiry.

In conclusion, while the translation serves its purpose of being relatable and modern, refining certain phrases could enhance its theological accuracy and ensure that it reflects the true intent of the passage.

> οἱ δὲ ἀμελήσαντες ἀπῆλθον, ὁ μὲν εἰς τὸν ἴδιον ἀγρόν, ὁ δὲ εἰς τὴν ἐμπορίαν αὐτοῦ; (But they paid no attention and went away, one to his own farm, another to his business.)

**Translation**:
> Algunos de los invitados se rieron de los mensajeros y se fueron a sus labranzas o negocios; (Some of the guests laughed at the messengers and went to their fields or businesses.)

**Suggested Translation**:
> Algunos de los invitados despreciaron la invitación y se fueron a trabajar en sus campos o a sus negocios; (Some of the guests despised the invitation and went to work in their fields or to their businesses.)

**Combined Review**:
The translation of MAT 22:5 generally conveys the original text's essence but requires refinement in clarity and style. The phrase "se rieron de los mensajeros" (they laughed at the messengers) does not fully capture the dismissive attitude present in the Greek, as it implies mockery rather than disregard; terms like "despreciaron" (despised) would communicate a stronger sense of disdain. Furthermore, while "se fueron a sus labranzas o negocios" (they went to their fields or businesses) is clear, a phrasing such as "se fueron a trabajar en sus campos o a sus negocios" (they went to work in their fields or to their businesses) might enhance understanding. Adjustments for clarity and tone are essential, especially considering the message's gravity regarding the invitation to the Kingdom of God. The use of "labranza" (farming) may also be confusing; more accessible terms like "trabajos" (jobs) or "actividades" (activities) might resonate better with the audience. Overall, this translation is a good effort but can be improved to better reflect the seriousness and nuances of the biblical message.

(But when the king came in to see the guests, he saw there a man which had not on a wedding garment.)

**Translation**:
> Pero cuando el rey fue a ver a los convidados, vio que uno no traía puesto el vestido de boda que había comprado para los invitados.  
(But when the king went to see the guests, he saw that one did not have on the wedding garment that he had bought for the guests.)

**Suggested Translation**:
> Pero cuando el rey entró para ver a los convidados, vio a un hombre que no llevaba el vestido de boda adecuado.  
(But when the king entered to see the guests, he saw a man who did not wear the appropriate wedding garment.)

**Combined Review**:
The translation of MAT 22:11 accurately captures the essence of the original text and presents it in a clear and modern Spanish style. However, there are concerns regarding the phrase 'que había comprado para los invitados,' (that he had bought for the guests) as it suggests that the garment was purchased, which is not explicitly stated in the original Greek. This misinterpretation could lead to confusion regarding the theological significance of the wedding garment, which should represent preparedness for acceptance into the feast. A more literal translation focusing on the necessity of wearing the appropriate attire, such as 'que no llevaba el vestido de boda adecuado,' (that he did not wear the appropriate wedding garment) would better reflect the original intent and significance of the passage. Overall, while the translation is commendable for its clarity and accessibility, adjustments are needed to ensure fidelity to the original text and its theological implications.

**Translation**:
> Mientras más humildemente sirvamos a los demás, más grandes seremos. (The more humbly we serve others, the greater we will be.) Para ser grande hay que servir a los demás. (To be great, one must serve others.)

**Suggested Translation**:
> El mayor entre ustedes será su servidor. (The greatest among you will be your servant.)

**Combined Review**:
The translation of MAT 23:11 generally succeeds in capturing the essence of the original Greek text, which emphasizes humility and service. However, multiple reviewers have suggested that the phrase "Mientras más humildemente sirvamos a los demás, más grandes seremos" (The more humbly we serve others, the greater we will be) could be simplified and made more direct to align closely with the original wording. A more accurate rendering would be "El mayor entre ustedes será su servidor," (The greatest among you will be your servant) which reflects the authoritative tone of Jesus’ message. Several reviews pointed out that the current translation introduces a complexity that may obscure the direct teaching of the scripture. While the modern language used is accessible to a contemporary audience, it is essential that the translation maintains fidelity to the original intent and formal tone of the biblical text. Adjustments for conciseness and clarity could enhance its effectiveness for the audience. Overall, the translation shows a commendable effort but requires refinement to better represent the scripture's message and gravity.

(But know this: that if the master of the house had known at what hour the thief would come, he would have watched and not allowed his house to be broken into.)

**Translation**:
> De la misma manera que el padre de familia se mantiene vigilante para que los ladrones no se introduzcan en la casa, (Just as the householder stays vigilant to prevent thieves from breaking into the house,)

**Suggested Translation**:
> Así como el dueño de casa se mantiene alerta para que el ladrón no se meta en su casa, de la misma manera ustedes deben estar preparados. (Just as the master of the house stays alert to prevent the thief from entering his house, in the same way, you must be prepared.)

**Combined Review**:
The translation of MAT 24:43 effectively communicates the core message of the original Greek text, capturing its urgency and importance. Most reviews commend the clarity and modern language used, making it accessible to Spanish speakers in Latin America. However, there are several suggestions for improvement.

1. The phrase 'de la misma manera que el padre de familia se mantiene vigilante' should be adjusted to 'así como el dueño de casa se mantiene alerta,' emphasizing vigilance more directly.  
2. Some reviews note that the translation is incomplete, missing essential elements of the verse which could affect comprehension. It’s crucial that each translation remains faithful to the original text and doesn’t omit key information.  
3. Additionally, the warning's urgency could be conveyed more effectively by enhancing certain phrases to reflect watchfulness against danger more clearly.  

Overall, while the translation succeeds in its accessibility and engagement, it requires some revisions to improve accuracy, completeness, and the tone of alertness that the scripture embodies.

> ὁ δὲ παραδιδοὺς αὐτὸν ἔδωκεν αὐτοῖς σημεῖον λέγων· ὃν ἂν φιλήσω, αὐτός ἐστι· κρατήσατε αὐτόν.  (And the betrayer gave them a sign, saying, 'Whomever I kiss, he is the one; seize him.')

**Translation**:
> esperaban solamente que Judas identificara con un beso al Maestro. (they were only waiting for Judas to identify the Master with a kiss.)

**Suggested Translation**:
> «Judas les dio una señal: al que yo bese, ese es. ¡Agárrenlo!» (Judas gave them a sign: 'The one I kiss is he; seize him!')

**Combined Review**:
The translation of MAT 26:48 adequately conveys the essence of the original Greek text. However, it has been noted that the phrase "esperaban solamente que Judas identificara con un beso al Maestro" (they were only waiting for Judas to identify the Master with a kiss) lacks clarity in expressing the gravity of Judas's betrayal. Suggestions include making the language more direct and emotionally resonant, possibly by using phrases like "El traidor les dio una señal diciendo: 'A quien yo bese, ese es; asegúrense de arrestarlo.'" (The betrayer gave them a sign, saying: 'Whomever I kiss, he is the one; make sure to arrest him.') This approach would enhance clarity and impact while remaining accessible and relatable to Spanish speakers. Overall, while the translation is commendable for its modern style, slight adjustments could sharpen the focus on the betrayal and improve engagement.

Overall, I would grade this translation as 85/100.

**MAT 3:8**: _(Grade 83.8)_

**Source**:
> ποιήσατε οὖν καρπὸν ἄξιον τῆς μετανοίας, (Therefore produce fruit worthy of repentance)

**Translation**:
> Demuestren, antes de bautizarse, que están arrepentidos. (Show that you are repentant before being baptized)

**Suggested Translation**:
> "Produzcan, pues, frutos dignos de arrepentimiento." (Therefore, produce fruits worthy of repentance)

**Combined Review**:
The translation of Matthew 3:8, "Demuestren, antes de bautizarse, que están arrepentidos," (Show that you are repentant before being baptized) effectively communicates the core message of repentance. However, several reviews point out that the phrase "antes de bautizarse" (before being baptized) adds unnecessary context that is not explicitly stated in the original Greek, which emphasizes producing fruit as evidence of repentance. A more direct translation, such as "Produzcan, pues, frutos dignos de arrepentimiento," (Therefore, produce fruits worthy of repentance) captures the essence and urgency of John's call for repentance more accurately.

Additionally, while the current translation is engaging for modern Spanish speakers, it could be improved for clarity in terms of theological implications and fidelity to the original text. The overall sentiment across reviews suggests maintaining the imperative call to action while ensuring that the translation reflects the original message's depth and intent.

**Translation**:
> Varios fariseos, en una entrevista, trataron de hacerlo caer en la trampa de decir algo que luego ellos pudieran utilizar contra él.  
(Various Pharisees, in an interview, tried to trap Him into saying something they could later use against Him.)  
> ―¿Apruebas el divorcio? —le preguntaron.  
("Do you approve of divorce?" they asked.)

**Suggested Translation**:
> Se acercaron a él algunos fariseos, tratando de ponerlo a prueba, y le preguntaron: "¿Está permitido que un hombre se divorcie de su esposa por cualquier motivo?"  
(Some Pharisees approached Him, trying to test Him, and asked Him, "Is it permitted for a man to divorce his wife for any reason?")

**Combined Review**:
The translation of MAT 19:3 generally captures the essence of the original text, successfully presenting the interaction between Jesus and the Pharisees. However, the use of phrases like 'en una entrevista' (in an interview) and 'trataron de hacerlo caer en la trampa' (tried to trap Him) might convey a more casual tone than desired in a biblical context. It is important to maintain the solemnity and authority of the dialogue, reflecting the serious inquiry about divorce. Suggestions for improvement include refining these phrases for greater fidelity to the original context and intent. A more traditional and straightforward translation could enhance clarity and maintain the seriousness of the topic discussed.

> «El sembrador de la buena semilla es el Hijo del Hombre». (The sower of the good seed is the Son of Man.)

**Combined Review**:
The translation of MAT 13:37 effectively conveys the essential meaning of the original text while making it accessible to modern Spanish speakers. However, the phrase 'Yo soy el labrador que siembra el grano selecto' (I am the farmer who sows the select grain) introduces ambiguity, as 'labrador' (farmer) may not accurately represent the term 'sower.' A more suitable term, such as 'sembrador' (sower), is recommended to better align with traditional biblical language and reflect the original text more accurately. Moreover, the identification of Jesus as 'el Hijo del Hombre' (the Son of Man) is crucial for theological accuracy and should be emphasized. The translation maintains clarity but could benefit from adjustments to enhance its reverence and fidelity to scripture, particularly within a conservative Christian context.

**MAT 10:10**: _(Grade 84.3)_

**Source**:
> μὴ πήραν εἰς ὁδὸν μηδὲ δύο χιτῶνας μηδὲ ὑποδήματα μηδὲ ῥάβδον· ἄξιος γάρ ἐστιν ὁ ἐργάτης τῆς τροφῆς αὐτοῦ.  
(Translation: "Do not carry a bag; nor two tunics, nor sandals, nor a staff; for the worker is worthy of his food.")

**Translation**:
> ni bolsa con comida; no lleven más túnicas ni más calzado que los que traen puestos, ni lleven bordón, porque las personas a las que ustedes ayuden tienen el deber de alimentarlos y cuidarlos.  
(Translation: "Do not carry a bag with food; do not bring more tunics or more shoes than those you have on, nor carry a staff, because the people you help have the duty to feed and care for them.")

**Suggested Translation**:
> «No lleven bolsa de comida, ni dos túnicas, ni sandalias, ni un bordón, porque el trabajador es digno de su sustento.»  
(Translation: "Do not carry a bag of food, nor two tunics, nor sandals, nor a staff, for the worker is worthy of his sustenance.")

**Combined Review**:
The translation of Matthew 10:10 generally succeeds in conveying the essential meaning and intent of the original Greek text while adopting a modern and accessible style suitable for Spanish speakers. Several reviewers noted that while the overall message is clear and relatable, the phrase "las personas a las que ustedes ayuden tienen el deber de alimentarlos y cuidarlos" (Translation: "the people you help have the duty to feed and care for them") introduces an interpretative bias that shifts the focus from the original directive emphasizing the worthiness of the worker to an implied obligation of the recipients. This could lead to ambiguity and potentially misinterpret the original intent. A more literal translation would better preserve the simplicity and clarity of Jesus' instruction. While the translation is commendable and effectively meets the objective of engagement for the target audience, slight adjustments in wording and focus are recommended to enhance fidelity to the original text.

**MAT 15:21**: _(Grade 84.5)_

**Source**:
> Καὶ ἐξελθὼν ἐκεῖθεν ὁ Ἰησοῦς ἀνεχώρησεν εἰς τὰ μέρη Τύρου καὶ Σιδῶνος. (And going out from there, Jesus withdrew to the regions of Tyre and Sidon.)

**Translation**:
> Jesús salió de allí y caminó los ochenta kilómetros que lo separaban de la región de Tiro y Sidón. (Jesus went out from there and walked the eighty kilometers that separated him from the region of Tyre and Sidon.)

**Suggested Translation**:
> Jesús salió de allí y fue a la región de Tiro y Sidón. (Jesus went out from there and went to the region of Tyre and Sidon.)

**Combined Review**:
The translation "Jesús salió de allí y caminó los ochenta kilómetros que lo separaban de la región de Tiro y Sidón" (Jesus went out from there and walked the eighty kilometers that separated him from the region of Tyre and Sidon) effectively conveys the movement of Jesus to the regions of Tyre and Sidon. However, the addition of "ochenta kilómetros" (eighty kilometers) introduces unnecessary detail not present in the Greek source, which simply mentions that Jesus left for those regions. This specific mention may detract from the text's fidelity and the intended focus on the narrative. For a conservative Christian audience, it is important to maintain the integrity of the biblical text while ensuring it is accessible. A simpler rendering, such as "Jesús salió de allí y fue a la región de Tiro y Sidón" (Jesus went out from there and went to the region of Tyre and Sidon), aligns better with the original text and serves the purpose of clarity without over-explaining. Overall, the translation is engaging and relatable, but slight adjustments could enhance its alignment with textual fidelity and the core message.

**MAT 10:12**: _(Grade 84.7)_

**Source**:
> εἰσερχόμενοι δὲ εἰς τὴν οἰκίαν ἀσπάσασθε αὐτὴν λέγοντες· εἰρήνη τῷ οἴκῳ τούτῳ. (As you enter the house, greet it, saying: Peace be to this house.)

**Translation**:
> Y al entrar a la casa, den su bendición a los que allí viven. (And when you enter the house, bless those who live there.)

**Suggested Translation**:
> Al entrar en la casa, saluden diciendo: '¡Que la paz esté en este hogar!' (When you enter the house, greet it, saying: 'Peace be to this house!')

**Combined Review**:
The translation of MAT 10:12 is generally well-received, capturing the essential message of the original Greek text. While the phrase 'den su bendición a los que allí viven' (bless those who live there) effectively communicates the directive to bless the household, it lacks specificity regarding the critical concept of 'peace' (εἰρήνη - peace), which is fundamental to the biblical greeting. Several reviewers suggest refining the translation to incorporate 'paz' (peace) more explicitly, possibly by using phrases like 'ofrezcan la paz' (offer peace) or 'saluden' (greet), which align more closely with the original intent of extending peace rather than just offering a blessing. The overall style remains modern and accessible for Spanish speakers, making it suitable for the target audience in Latin America, but improvements for accuracy and fidelity to the original text are encouraged.

**MAT 15:11**: _(Grade 84.7)_

**Source**:
> οὐ τὸ εἰσερχόμενον εἰς τὸ στόμα κοινοῖ τὸν ἄνθρωπον, ἀλλὰ τὸ ἐκπορευόμενον ἐκ τοῦ στόματος τοῦτο κοινοῖ τὸν ἄνθρωπον. (It is not what goes into the mouth that defiles a person, but what comes out of the mouth; this is what defiles a person.)

**Translation**:
> Lo que daña el alma no es lo que entra por la boca, sino los pensamientos malos y las palabras con que estos se expresan. (What harms the soul is not what enters through the mouth, but the bad thoughts and the words with which they are expressed.)

**Suggested Translation**:
> "No es lo que entra por la boca lo que contamina al hombre, sino lo que sale de la boca; esto es lo que contamina al hombre." (It is not what goes into the mouth that defiles a person, but what comes out of the mouth; this is what defiles a person.)

**Combined Review**:
The translation of MAT 15:11 is largely effective in conveying the essential message of the verse, emphasizing that it is not what enters the mouth that defiles a person, but rather what comes out of it. The modern language makes it accessible to Spanish speakers, particularly in Latin America. However, the phrase 'lo que daña el alma' (what harms the soul) slightly deviates from the original meaning, which focuses on defilement rather than the soul. A more direct translation could improve clarity and fidelity to the original text. Emphasizing the actions and words that reflect the condition of the heart is crucial for maintaining theological accuracy. Overall, while the translation is thoughtful and engages a modern audience, adjustments in word choice and focus could enhance its alignment with traditional interpretations.

**MAT 18:28**: _(Grade 84.7)_

**Source**:
> ἐξελθὼν δὲ ὁ δοῦλος ἐκεῖνος εὗρεν ἕνα τῶν συνδούλων αὐτοῦ, ὃς ὤφειλεν αὐτῷ ἑκατὸν δηνάρια, καὶ κρατήσας αὐτὸν ἔπνιγε λέγων· ἀπόδος μοι εἴ τι ὀφείλεις.  (When that same servant went out, he found one of his fellow servants who owed him a hundred denarii, and he seized him and began to choke him, saying, 'Pay what you owe!')

**Translation**:
> »Pero cuando aquel mismo hombre salió de allí, fue adonde estaba alguien que le debía veinte mil pesos y, agarrándolo por el cuello, exigió pago inmediato. (But when that same man went out, he found one of his fellow servants who owed him twenty thousand pesos, and seizing him by the throat, he demanded immediate payment.)

**Suggested Translation**:
> »Pero cuando aquel mismo hombre salió de allí, fue a donde estaba alguien que le debía cien denarios, y tomándolo con fuerza, le exigió el pago inmediato. (But when that same man went out, he went to where there was someone who owed him a hundred denarii, and seizing him, he demanded immediate payment.)

**Combined Review**:
The translation of MAT 18:28 effectively communicates the original message in a modern, accessible manner, scoring an average grade of 85.5. However, the use of 'veinte mil pesos' (twenty thousand pesos) is a point of contention as it significantly diverges from the original Greek, which indicates a debt of 'cien denarios' (one hundred denarii). This discrepancy can create confusion about the passage's intention, which is to emphasize the difference between the forgiven debts. While the phrase 'exigió pago inmediato' (demanded immediate payment) effectively conveys urgency, the informal expression 'agarrándolo por el cuello' (seizing him by the throat) might detract from the gravity of the biblical context. Overall, while the translation is modern and relatable, refinements are necessary to enhance accuracy and maintain the theological weight inherent in the original text.

**MAT 19:12**: _(Grade 84.7)_

**Source**:
> εἰσὶ γὰρ εὐνοῦχοι οἵτινες ἐκ κοιλίας μητρὸς ἐγεννήθησαν οὕτω. καὶ εἰσὶν εὐνοῦχοι οἵτινες εὐνουχίσθησαν ὑπὸ τῶν ἀνθρώπων, καὶ εἰσιν εὐνοῦχοι οἵτινες εὐνούχισαν ἑαυτοὺς διὰ τὴν βασιλείαν τῶν οὐρανῶν. ὁ δυνάμενος χωρεῖν χωρείτω.  
(For there are eunuchs who were born that way from their mother's womb; and there are eunuchs who were made eunuchs by men; and there are eunuchs who have made themselves eunuchs for the kingdom of heaven. He who is able to receive this, let him receive it.)

**Translation**:
> Hay personas que no se casan porque nacieron incapacitados para el matrimonio; otros no lo hacen porque los hombres los incapacitaron; y aun otros, porque no desean hacerlo por amor al reino de los cielos. El que pueda aceptar esto último, que lo acepte.  
(There are persons who do not marry because they were born unable to marry; others do so because men have made them unable; and others do so because they do not wish to for the love of the kingdom of heaven. He who can accept this, let him accept it.)

**Suggested Translation**:
> "Porque hay eunuco que nació así desde el vientre de su madre; otros son eunuco por la acción de los hombres; y hay eunuco que se ha hecho a sí mismo tal por amor al reino de los cielos. El que pueda aceptar esto, que lo haga con entendimiento."  
(For there are eunuchs who were born that way from their mother's womb; others are eunuchs by the action of men; and there are eunuchs who have made themselves eunuchs for the sake of the kingdom of heaven. He who is able to accept this, let him accept it.)

**Combined Review**:
The translation of MAT 19:12 is generally well-executed, providing clarity and accessibility for modern Spanish-speaking audiences, particularly in Latin America. While it effectively communicates the original meaning and retains important theological concepts, several reviews suggest improvements for greater precision. The phrase "nacieron incapacitados para el matrimonio" (were born unable to marry) could be more accurately rendered to reflect the concept of eunuchs without diminishing its theological implications. Additionally, there is a recommendation for a more formal tone in phrases like "que lo acepte" (let him accept it) to align better with traditional biblical language. Overall, the translation successfully engages a contemporary audience but can benefit from slight adjustments to enhance both accuracy and reverence.

**MAT 6:3**: _(Grade 85.0)_

**Source**:
> σοῦ δὲ ποιοῦντος ἐλεημοσύνην μὴ γνώτω ἡ ἀριστερά σου τί ποιεῖ ἡ δεξιά σου, (But when you give to the needy, let not your left hand know what your right hand is doing)

**Translation**:
> Pero cuando hagan algún bien, háganlo discretamente. (But when you do good, do it discreetly.)

**Suggested Translation**:
> Pero cuando hagas limosna, que tu mano izquierda no sepa lo que hace tu mano derecha, (But when you give alms, let your left hand not know what your right hand is doing)

**Combined Review**:
The translation of MAT 6:3 generally captures the essence of the original Greek text while using a modern and accessible Spanish style suitable for the target audience. However, the phrase "háganlo discretamente" (do it discreetly) lacks the depth and precision found in the original wording, which emphasizes the importance of keeping one's charitable actions private. A more direct rendering, such as "que tu mano izquierda no sepa lo que hace tu mano derecha" (let your left hand not know what your right hand is doing), would more accurately convey the instruction's intent and metaphorical nuance. While the current translation is commendable for its clarity, it is important to enhance fidelity to the original text in order to preserve the weight of the teaching on anonymity in giving alms. Overall, this is a solid translation with room for improvement in precision.

**MAT 6:16**: _(Grade 85.0)_

**Source**:
> Ὅταν δὲ νηστεύητε, μὴ γίνεσθε ὥσπερ οἱ ὑποκριταὶ σκυθρωποί· ἀφανίζουσι γὰρ τὰ πρόσωπα αὐτῶν ὅπως φανῶσι τοῖς ἀνθρώποις νηστεύοντες· ἀμὴν λέγω ὑμῖν ὅτι ἀπέχουσι τὸν μισθὸν αὐτῶν.  
(When you fast, do not look somber as the hypocrites do, for they disfigure their faces to show others they are fasting. Truly I tell you, they have received their reward in full.)

**Translation**:
> »Cuando ustedes ayunen, no lo hagan en público como los hipócritas, que tratan de aparentar que están pálidos y desaliñados para que la gente se dé cuenta de que ayunaron. Les aseguro que, aparte de esto, no tendrán más recompensa.  
(When you fast, do not look somber as the hypocrites do, for they disfigure their faces to show others they are fasting. Truly I tell you, they have received their reward in full.)

**Suggested Translation**:
> »Cuando ustedes ayunen, no se pongan tristes como los hipócritas, que hacen ver que están tristes. Les aseguro que no recibirán recompensa alguna.  
(When you fast, do not look somber as the hypocrites do, for they disfigure their faces to show others they are fasting. Truly I tell you, they have received their reward in full.)

**Combined Review**:
The translation of MAT 6:16 is generally clear and accessible, effectively conveying the original message intended in the Greek text while using modern and familiar language for Spanish-speaking audiences. However, several reviews note that the phrase 'aparte de esto, no tendrán más recompensa' (aside from this, they will have no further reward) could be misleading and fail to fully capture the seriousness of losing one's reward for insincerity in fasting. Additionally, while the description of hypocrites as 'que tratan de aparentar que están pálidos y desaliñados' (who try to appear pale and disheveled) is relatable, it may emphasize outward appearance rather than the essence of hypocrisy itself. Suggestions for improvement include using simpler terms like 'aparentar' (to pretend) and ensuring consistency in terminology to align with traditional meanings within a conservative Christian context. Overall, the translation is effective but can be enhanced for clarity and fidelity to the source text.

**MAT 17:15**: _(Grade 85.0)_

**Source**:  
> Κύριε, ἐλέησόν μου τὸν υἱόν, ὅτι σεληνιάζεται καὶ κακῶς πάσχει· πολλάκις γὰρ πίπτει εἰς τὸ πῦρ καὶ πολλάκις εἰς τὸ ὕδωρ. (Lord, have mercy on my son, for he is a lunatic and suffers greatly; for often he falls into the fire and often into the water.)

**Translation**:  
> ―Señor —dijo—, ten misericordia de mi hijo, que está enfermo de la mente y padece muchísimo. Muchas veces se cae en el fuego o en el agua, con peligro de su vida. (Lord, he said, have mercy on my son, for he is sick in the mind and suffers greatly. Many times he falls into the fire or into the water, endangering his life.)

**Suggested Translation**:  
> ―Señor —dijo—, ten misericordia de mi hijo, que es lunático y sufre mucho; porque muchas veces cae en el fuego y muchas en el agua. (Lord, he said, have mercy on my son, for he is a lunatic and suffers greatly; for often he falls into the fire and often into the water.)

**Combined Review**:
The translation of MAT 17:15 is clear and effectively communicates the urgency and plea of the father for his son. While the use of modern language is commendable for accessibility among Spanish speakers in Latin America, there are concerns about the phrase "está enfermo de la mente" (he is sick in the mind) as it may lack the specificity regarding the boy's condition as intended in the original Greek text, which implies demonic possession (σεληνιάζεται - he is a lunatic). It is suggested to consider terms like "lunático" (lunatic) or a more traditional phrase to maintain theological accuracy. Despite these points, the translation overall retains the essence and compassion of the original scripture and is viewed as a solid effort, albeit with room for refinement in language to better align with conservative Christian values.

**MAT 18:34**: _(Grade 85.0)_

**Source**: 
> καὶ ὀργισθεὶς ὁ κύριος αὐτοῦ παρέδωκεν αὐτὸν τοῖς βασανισταῖς ἕως οὗ ἀποδῷ πᾶν τὸ ὀφειλόμενον αὐτῷ. (And being angry, his lord delivered him to the torturers until he should pay all that was due unto him.)

**Translation**: 
> Tan enojado estaba el rey que lo envió a las cámaras de tortura hasta que pagara el último centavo. (So angry was the king that he sent him to the chambers of torture until he paid the last cent.)

**Suggested Translation**: 
> Tan enojado estaba el rey que lo envió a un lugar de castigo hasta que se saldara toda su deuda. (So angry was the king that he sent him to a place of punishment until his entire debt was settled.)

**Combined Review**:
The translation of MAT 18:34 effectively captures the essence of the original text, conveying the emotional intensity and consequences of the king's anger towards the servant. However, the phrase 'cámaras de tortura' (chambers of torture) may be considered overly graphic for a conservative Christian audience. A suggested alternative, such as 'lugar de castigo' (place of punishment), would maintain the seriousness of the consequence while being more palatable. Additionally, the phrase 'hasta que pagara el último centavo' (until he paid the last cent) somewhat diminishes the spiritual implications of forgiveness and judgment inherent in the original text. Therefore, while the translation is modern and clear, adjustments in language could enhance its sensitivity to a conservative perspective, maintaining its overall effectiveness.

**MAT 20:25**: _(Grade 85.0)_

**Source**:

(But Jesus called them and said to them: "You know that the rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them, and their great ones exercise authority over them.")

**Translation**:  
> pero Jesús los llamó y les dijo:  
> ―En las naciones paganas, los reyes, los tiranos o cualquier funcionario está por encima de sus súbditos.  
(But Jesus called them and said: "In the pagan nations, the kings, the tyrants, or any official are above their subjects.")

**Suggested Translation**:  
> Pero Jesús los llamó y les dijo:  
> ―En las naciones paganas, los reyes, los gobernantes o cualquier funcionario están por encima de sus seguidores.  
(But Jesus called them and said: "In the pagan nations, the kings, the rulers, or any official are above their followers.")

**Combined Review**:
The translation of MAT 20:25 is generally well-done, presenting a clear and accessible interpretation of the original Greek text. However, the phrase "los reyes, los tiranos o cualquier funcionario" (the kings, the tyrants, or any official) introduces a potentially negative connotation that diverges from the original's neutral portrayal of authority. It is suggested that using terms such as "los gobernantes" (the rulers) or "los grandes" (the great ones) would better align with traditional conservative interpretations, reflecting the authority without implying tyranny. Additionally, the term "súbditos" (subjects) is less common in modern usage, and alternatives like "seguidores" (followers) or "ciudadanos" (citizens) may resonate better with contemporary readers. Overall, while the translation effectively communicates the message, attention to word choice could enhance theological precision and clarity.

**Translation**:
> Cuando el padre le pidió al menor que fuera, este le respondió: “¡Con mucho gusto! ¡Ahora mismo voy!”. Pero no fue. (When the father asked the younger son to go, he responded: “With much pleasure! Right now I will go!”. But he did not go.)

**Suggested Translation**:
> Cuando el padre le pidió al menor que fuera, este le respondió: “Sí, padre; ahora mismo voy”. Pero no fue. (When the father asked the younger son to go, he responded: “Yes, father; right now I will go”. But he did not go.)

**Review**: The translation of MAT 21:30 effectively conveys the essence of the original Greek text while utilizing a modern and accessible Spanish style. The phrase '¡Con mucho gusto! ¡Ahora mismo voy!' (With much pleasure! Right now I will go!) could be interpreted as overly casual or even sarcastic in certain contexts, which may not align with the seriousness of the original request. A more straightforward approach, such as 'Sí, padre; ahora mismo voy' (Yes, father; right now I will go), would better capture the respect and urgency of the son's response without suggesting a flippant attitude. Overall, the translation is clear and retains the original meaning but could be slightly improved for tone and accuracy. Additionally, the phrase 'Díganme:' (Tell me:) at the end of the translation feels out of place and may confuse readers. This comprehensive review suggests minor adjustments to enhance fidelity to the source while maintaining an engaging tone for a Latin American audience.

(Again he sent other servants, saying, 'Tell those who are invited, Behold, I have prepared my dinner; my oxen and fatlings are killed, and all things are ready; come to the wedding.')

**Translation**:
> Envió a otros siervos a decirles que fueran pronto, que no se demoraran, que ya los asados estaban listos.  
(He sent other servants to say to them, 'Tell those who are invited, come quickly, that they should not delay, for the roasted meats are ready.')

**Suggested Translation**:
> Envió a otros siervos a decirles que vengan pronto, que he preparado el banquete, los toros y la comida están listos; ¡vengan a la boda!  
(He sent other servants to say to them, 'Tell those who are invited to come quickly, that I have prepared the banquet, the bulls and the food are ready; come to the wedding!')

**Combined Review**:
The translation of MAT 22:4 effectively captures the essence of the original text while aiming to be accessible to a modern Spanish-speaking audience. Although the translation communicates the urgency and significance of the invitation, certain phrases, such as "que no se demoraran" (that they should not delay) and "asados" (roasted meats), come off as too casual and may not adequately reflect the gravity of the parable's context. It is suggested to opt for a more direct expression like "vengan pronto" (come quickly) to convey urgency and use terms such as "banquete" (banquet) or "comida" (food) to maintain a more respectful and solemn tone appropriate for a biblical translation. Overall, while the translation is engaging, slight adjustments in word choice could enhance fidelity to the original text's weight and theological implications.

> Οἱ δὲ Φαρισαῖοι ἀκούσαντες ὅτι ἐφίμωσε τοὺς Σαδδουκαίους, συνήχθησαν ἐπὶ τὸ αὐτό, (But the Pharisees, hearing that He had silenced the Sadducees, gathered together)

**Translation**:
> Los fariseos no se dejaron amedrentar por la derrota de los saduceos (The Pharisees were not intimidated by the defeat of the Sadducees)

**Suggested Translation**:
> Los fariseos, al oír que Jesús había silenciado a los saduceos, se reunieron entre sí. (The Pharisees, hearing that Jesus had silenced the Sadducees, gathered together)

**Combined Review**:
The translation of MAT 22:34 presents the original Greek text in a clear and accessible modern Spanish style. However, the phrase "no se dejaron amedrentar por la derrota de los saduceos" (they were not intimidated by the defeat of the Sadducees) may not accurately reflect the original text's intent. The reviews collectively suggest that the focus should be more on the Pharisees gathering in response to Jesus' silencing of the Sadducees, rather than implying a reaction of intimidation. A more neutral wording, such as "Los fariseos, al oír que Jesús había silenciado a los saduceos, se reunieron entre sí," (The Pharisees, hearing that Jesus had silenced the Sadducees, gathered together) is recommended to better convey the sense of the passage. Additionally, a slightly more formal and reverent tone would align better with biblical translation standards, considering the seriousness of the context.

**Suggested Translation**:
> Y ustedes también están llenando la medida de sus padres. (And you are also filling the measure of your fathers.)

**Combined Review**:
The translation of MAT 23:32, "¡Acaben de imitarlos! ¡Pónganse a la altura de ellos!" (Finish imitating them! Live up to them!) successfully captures the essence of the original Greek text while maintaining accessibility for modern Spanish-speaking audiences. However, the phrase "¡Acaben de imitarlos!" (Finish imitating them!) could be interpreted as a call to simply mimic the actions of the fathers rather than conveying the original intent of judgment against their sins. Some reviewers suggested that alternatives like "¡Completen la medida de sus padres!" (Complete the measure of your fathers!) might better express the condemnation intended in the original. Despite some critiques regarding clarity and fidelity to the source material, the translation generally reflects the tone and urgency of Jesus' message effectively. Overall, while engaging for a contemporary audience, minor adjustments could enhance the accuracy and convey the intended gravity of the rebuke.

**MAT 24:8**: _(Grade 85.0)_

**Source**:  
> πάντα δὲ ταῦτα ἀρχὴ ὠδίνων. (But all these things are the beginning of birth pains.)  

**Translation**:  
> Pero esto será sólo el principio de los horrores que vendrán. (But this will be only the beginning of the horrors that will come.)  

**Suggested Translation**:  
> Pero todo esto será apenas el principio de los dolores. (But all this will be only the beginning of the pains.)  

**Combined Review**:
The translation of MAT 24:8, rendered as "Pero esto será sólo el principio de los horrores que vendrán" (But this will be only the beginning of the horrors that will come), captures the urgency of the original message, though the term "horrores" (horrors) might not fully align with the original Greek's implication of suffering or "birth pains" (ὠδίνων). A consensus suggests that using terms like "dolores" (pains) or "tribulaciones" (tribulations) would provide a more precise theological understanding, consistent with traditional interpretations. This would enhance the clarity and accuracy for conservative readers who seek a direct connection to the scriptural language. While the current translation is generally effective and engaging for a Latin American audience, slight adjustments could further improve fidelity to the source material and deepen the theological significance. Overall, the translation is rated positively but acknowledges that minor refinements could enhance its precision.

**Translation**:
> y muchos de ustedes volverán a caer en pecado y traicionarán y aborrecerán a los demás. (and many of you will fall back into sin and betray and hate one another.)

**Suggested Translation**:
> y muchos se escandalizarán, y se traicionarán y se odiarán unos a otros. (and many will be offended, and will betray one another and will hate one another.)

**Combined Review**:
The translation of MAT 24:10 is generally considered effective and conveys the original meaning well. However, there are notable concerns regarding the phrase 'volverán a caer en pecado' (will fall back into sin), which may lead to misunderstandings. This phrase could be interpreted as less direct than the original Greek term 'σκανδαλισθήσονται' (will be offended or scandalized), which emphasizes a moral failing or stumbling rather than simply sinning again. Additionally, the expression 'aborrecerán a los demás' (will hate one another) could be softened to 'se odiarán mutuamente' (will hate each other), aligning more closely with the intent of mutual betrayal as found in the original text. Overall, while the translation serves the goal of accessibility, it requires slight refinements for clarity and precision in order to reflect the serious warnings presented in Jesus' message.

> »Cuando el que había recibido los diez mil pesos se presentó ante el jefe, le dijo: “Señor, sabía que eres un hombre exigente, que cosechas donde no has sembrado y recoges donde no has esparcido. Por eso, atemorizado, fui y escondí tu dinero en la tierra. Aquí está lo que te pertenece.”  
(When the one who had received the ten thousand pesos came to his master, he said: 'Lord, I knew you to be a demanding man, reaping where you have not sown and gathering where you have not scattered. Therefore, afraid, I went and hid your money in the ground. Here is what belongs to you.')

**Combined Review**:
The translation of MAT 25:24-25 effectively conveys the original message and intent of the scripture, maintaining a clear and accessible modern Spanish style suitable for Latin American audiences. However, the use of the phrase "tan duro" (so hard) could potentially misrepresent the master's character as more informal and less reverent than intended, while also softening the stronger implications of 'harsh' from the Greek text. The colloquial expression "hasta el último centavo" (every last cent) could detract from the seriousness of the servant's actions, suggesting a trivialization of the context. Overall, the translation is solid, preserving the essence of the parable, yet there are areas for improvement, particularly in using language that reflects the gravity and theological depth expected in a conservative biblical context.

**MAT 25:26**: _(Grade 85.0)_

**Source**:
> ἀποκριθεὶς δὲ ὁ κύριος αὐτοῦ εἶπεν αὐτῷ· πονηρὲ δοῦλε καὶ ὀκνηρέ! ᾔδεις ὅτι θερίζω ὅπου οὐκ ἔσπειρα καὶ συνάγω ὅθεν οὐ διεσκόρπισα!  
> (And answering, his lord said to him, 'You wicked and slothful servant! You knew that I reap where I did not sow, and gather where I scattered no seed!')

**Translation**:
> “¡Malvado! ¡Haragán! Si sabías que quería obtener utilidades,  
> ("Wicked! Lazy! If you knew that I wanted to make a profit,")

**Suggested Translation**:
> “¡Siervo malo y perezoso! Si sabías que cosecho donde no he sembrado y recojo donde no esparcí,  
> ("You evil and lazy servant! If you knew that I reap where I have not sown and gather where I have not scattered,")

**Combined Review**:
The translation of MAT 25:26 receives a grade of 85 and is generally accurate, capturing the original intent and conveying the Master's condemnation of the servant. While modern terminology makes it accessible to a contemporary audience, the terms "Malvado" and "Haragán" may not sufficiently reflect the weight of the master's reproach. A more traditional rendering, such as "siervo malo y perezoso," would align better with conservative Christian values and enhance the moral clarity of the message. Additionally, the phrase "si sabías que quería obtener utilidades" could benefit from a more direct translation to retain the stronger accusatory tone present in the Greek text. Overall, while the translation is commendable for its clarity and accessibility, attention to linguistic nuances would improve fidelity to the original scripture.

**MAT 10:36**: _(Grade 85.2)_

**Source**:  
> καὶ ἐχθροὶ τοῦ ἀνθρώπου οἱ οἰκιακοὶ αὐτοῦ. (And the enemies of a man will be those of his own household.)

**Translation**:  
> ¡Cada quien tendrá a sus peores enemigos en su propia casa! (Everyone will have their worst enemies in their own home!)

**Suggested Translation**:  
> Los mayores enemigos de un hombre serán los de su propia casa. (The greatest enemies of a man will be those of his own household.)

**Combined Review**:
The translation "¡Cada quien tendrá a sus peores enemigos en su propia casa!" (Everyone will have their worst enemies in their own home!) effectively conveys the original message of MAT 10:36, highlighting the essence of familial conflict that Jesus addresses. While it uses modern and accessible language suitable for Latin American audiences, the phrase 'peores enemigos' (worst enemies) may come across as colloquial and less reverent. A more traditional option, such as 'los mayores enemigos' (the greatest enemies), could enhance the solemnity of the message. Additionally, the expression '¡Cada quien!' (Everyone!) introduces a level of informality that might be too casual for scripture. Overall, while the translation achieves the objectives of accessibility and engagement, minor refinements for fidelity and reverence could better suit a conservative Christian perspective.

**MAT 17:25**: _(Grade 85.3)_

**Source**:  
> λέγει, ναί. καὶ ὅτε εἰσῆλθεν εἰς τὴν οἰκίαν, προέφθασεν αὐτὸν ὁ Ἰησοῦς λέγων· τί σοι δοκεῖ, Σίμων; οἱ βασιλεῖς τῆς γῆς ἀπὸ τίνων λαμβάνουσι τέλη ἢ κῆνσον; ἀπὸ τῶν υἱῶν αὐτῶν ἢ ἀπὸ τῶν ἀλλοτρίων;  
(He says, "Yes." And when he entered the house, Jesus anticipated him, saying, "What do you think, Simon? From whom do the kings of the earth take customs or taxes? From their own sons or from strangers?")  

**Translation**:  
> —¡Claro que los paga! —les respondió Pedro—, e inmediatamente entró a la casa a hablarle a Jesús sobre el asunto.  
(No doubt they pay —Peter replied—, and he immediately entered the house to speak to Jesus about the matter.)  
> No había pronunciado todavía la primera palabra, cuando Jesús le preguntó: —  
(He had not yet spoken the first word, when Jesus asked him:)  
> ¿A quién crees tú, Pedro, que cobran tributos los reyes de la tierra? ¿A sus súbditos o a los extranjeros?  
(To whom do you think, Peter, that the kings of the earth collect tribute? From their subjects or from strangers?)  

**Suggested Translation**:  
> —Sí, sí paga —respondió Pedro—. Y cuando entró en la casa, Jesús le habló primero, diciendo: —¿Qué piensas, Simón? ¿De quiénes cobran impuestos los reyes de la tierra? ¿De sus hijos o de los extranjeros?  
(—Yes, they pay —Peter replied—. And when he entered the house, Jesus spoke first to him, saying: —What do you think, Simon? From whom do the kings of the earth collect taxes? From their children or from foreigners?)  

**Combined Review**:
The translation of Matthew 17:25 is generally well-received, achieving clarity and modernity in language while maintaining the essence of the original text. Most reviewers highlight the accessibility for Spanish speakers, particularly in Latin America, and commend the conversational tone captured in the phrase "¡Claro que los paga!" ("No doubt they pay!") However, some reviewers note that this informal expression may be too casual for a sacred text. They suggest finding a balance between approachability and reverence. While the interaction between Peter and Jesus is effectively rendered, slight adjustments are recommended for a more formal tone, ensuring that the theological weight of the passage is preserved. A more direct representation of the original dialogue without extra embellishments is encouraged to enhance fidelity to the source. Overall, the translation demonstrates a solid effort towards making the scripture engaging and understandable, although attention to formal language could improve its appropriateness for a biblical context.

> ὁ δὲ ἐγερθεὶς παρέλαβε τὸ παιδίον καὶ τὴν μητέρα αὐτοῦ καὶ ἦλθεν εἰς γῆν Ἰσραήλ. (But he arose and took the young child and his mother, and came into the land of Israel.)

**Translation**:
> Así fue como José regresó a la tierra de Israel con el niño y su madre. Pero en el camino se enteró de que Arquelao, hijo de Herodes, reinaba en Judea, y tuvo miedo de ir allí. (This is how Joseph returned to the land of Israel with the child and his mother. But on the way, he learned that Archelaus, son of Herod, was reigning in Judea, and he was afraid to go there.)

**Suggested Translation**:
> José se levantó y regresó a la tierra de Israel con el niño y su madre. (Joseph arose and returned to the land of Israel with the child and his mother.)

**Combined Review**:
The translation of MAT 2:21 is generally accurate, clearly conveying the essence of the original Greek text while utilizing modern and accessible Spanish. Most reviews commend the translation's clarity and engagement for Spanish-speaking audiences, particularly in Latin America. However, multiple reviewers noted that the additional context regarding Archelaus, while informative, deviates from the directness of the original text. This could distract from the main action of Joseph's return to Israel. While the translation successfully balances fidelity to the source material and contemporary style, it is suggested that minor adjustments could enhance clarity and simplicity, possibly by omitting the context about Archelaus or streamlining its inclusion. Overall, it is recognized as a solid translation that may benefit from slight refinements to maintain focus on the primary narrative.

**MAT 4:6**: _(Grade 85.5)_

**Source**:
> καὶ λέγει αὐτῷ· εἰ υἱὸς εἶ τοῦ Θεοῦ, βάλε σεαυτὸν κάτω· γέγραπται γὰρ ὅτι τοῖς ἀγγέλοις αὐτοῦ ἐντελεῖται περὶ σοῦ, καὶ ἐπὶ χειρῶν ἀροῦσί σε, μήποτε προσκόψῃς πρὸς λίθον τὸν πόδα σου. (And he said to him, "If you are the Son of God, throw yourself down; for it is written, 'He will command his angels concerning you,' and 'On their hands they will bear you up, lest you strike your foot against a stone.'")

**Translation**:
> —Si eres el Hijo de Dios —le dijo—, tírate desde aquí. Las Escrituras dicen que Dios enviará a sus ángeles a cuidarte, y ni siquiera te tropezarás con las rocas. ("If you are the Son of God," he said, "throw yourself down from here. For it is written, 'He will command his angels to guard you, and they will lift you up in their hands, so that you will not strike your foot against a stone.'")

**Suggested Translation**:
> —Si eres el Hijo de Dios —le dijo—, lánzate desde aquí, porque las Escrituras dicen que Dios enviará a sus ángeles a cuidarte, y ellos te sostendrán en sus manos para que no tropieces con piedra alguna. ("If you are the Son of God," he said, "throw yourself down, for it is written: 'He will command his angels concerning you, and they will lift you up in their hands, so that you will not strike your foot against a stone.'")

**Combined Review**:
The translation of MAT 4:6 effectively captures the essence of the original text while being accessible to modern Spanish speakers. There is consensus that the phrase 'tírate desde aquí' should be replaced with 'lánzate desde aquí' for a more dynamic and engaging tone. Several reviewers noted that the translation should retain a level of reverence and authority appropriate for a conservative Christian audience, particularly concerning scriptural references. While the core message and theological implications are generally well-preserved, adjustments are recommended to maintain a formal tone and enhance clarity. The phrase 'y ni siquiera te tropezarás con las rocas' has been flagged as colloquial; a more traditional rendering could be beneficial. Overall, the translation reflects a good effort toward clarity and fidelity to the original scripture, with some room for improvement in tone and precision.

**MAT 8:6**: _(Grade 85.5)_

**Source**:
> Κύριε, ὁ παῖς μου βέβληται ἐν τῇ οἰκίᾳ παραλυτικός, δεινῶς βασανιζόμενος. (Lord, my servant is lying at home paralyzed, dreadfully tormented.)

**Translation**:
> que sanara a un sirviente que estaba en cama paralítico y que sufría mucho. (to heal a servant who was in bed paralyzed and suffering a lot.)

**Suggested Translation**:
> Señor, mi siervo está en la casa paralítico, sufriendo terriblemente. (Lord, my servant is at home paralyzed, suffering terribly.)

**Combined Review**:
The translation of Matthew 8:6 effectively communicates the urgency and desperation of the centurion's plea for his servant. While the phrase 'que sanara a un sirviente que estaba en cama paralítico y que sufría mucho' (to heal a servant who was in bed paralyzed and suffering a lot) conveys the basic meaning, it is noted that the term 'sirviente' (servant) could be improved to 'siervo' (servant) to better reflect the original text's intent regarding the relationship. Some reviews suggest rephrasing for clarity, emphasizing the immediacy of the request, and simplifying the structure to enhance readability in modern Spanish. Overall, while the translation is generally strong, incorporating these adjustments could improve its clarity, depth, and engagement for contemporary audiences.

**MAT 10:11**: _(Grade 85.5)_

**Source**:
> εἰς ἣν δ᾽ ἂν πόλιν ἢ κώμην εἰσέλθητε, ἐξετάσατε τίς ἐν αὐτῇ ἄξιός ἐστι, κἀκεῖ μείνατε ἕως ἂν ἐξέλθητε.  
(Translation: "And into whatever city or village you enter, inquire who in it is worthy, and stay there until you go out.")

**Translation**:
> Cuando lleguen a cualquier ciudad o pueblo, busquen a una persona de confianza y quédense en su casa hasta que se vayan a otro pueblo.  
(Translation: "When you enter any city or village, look for a trustworthy person and stay in their house until you leave for another village.")

**Suggested Translation**:
> Cuando lleguen a cualquier ciudad o pueblo, busquen a una persona digna y permanezcan en su casa hasta que salgan.  
(Translation: "When you arrive at any city or town, look for a worthy person and stay in their house until you leave.")

**Combined Review**:
The translation of MAT 10:11 is generally well-executed, achieving clarity and accessibility for modern Spanish speakers. While the phrase "busquen a una persona de confianza" ("look for a trustworthy person") effectively conveys trustworthiness, it does not fully capture the nuance of "quién es digno" ("who is worthy") from the original text, which implies finding someone who is worthy. A preferred phrase could be "busquen a una persona digna" ("look for a worthy person") to maintain theological fidelity. Furthermore, simplifying "hasta que se vayan a otro pueblo" ("until they go to another village") to "hasta que salgan" ("until you leave") enhances conciseness. The instruction about staying in one house until leaving is clear and aligns with the original intent of the scripture. Overall, this is a commendable translation that deserves a solid score while recognizing minor adjustments could improve accuracy and better reflect the original meaning.

**MAT 10:26**: _(Grade 85.5)_

**Source**:
> μὴ οὖν φοβηθῆτε αὐτούς· οὐδὲν γάρ ἐστι κεκαλυμμένον ὃ οὐκ ἀποκαλυφθήσεται, καὶ κρυπτὸν ὃ οὐ γνωσθήσεται. (So do not be afraid of them; for nothing is covered that will not be revealed, or hidden that will not be known.)

**Translation**:
> Pero no tengan miedo, porque pronto llegará la hora de la verdad y no habrá secreto que no se descubra. (But do not be afraid, for soon the hour of truth will come, and there will be no secret that will not be discovered.)

**Suggested Translation**:
> »Así que no tengan miedo, porque no habrá nada oculto que no será revelado, y ningún secreto que no se conozca. (Therefore, do not be afraid, for there is nothing hidden that will not be revealed, and no secret that will not be known.)

**Combined Review**:
The translation of Matthew 10:26 effectively captures the essence of the original text, conveying reassurance and the certainty of revelation. The phrase "pero no tengan miedo" (but do not be afraid) resonates well, but "llegará la hora de la verdad" (the hour of truth will come) is seen as somewhat colloquial and diverges from a more traditional rendering. A more direct translation would emphasize the inevitability of revelation, thus maintaining theological integrity and a stronger connection to the original text. While the translation is accessible and engaging for Spanish speakers, slight adjustments could improve its accuracy, particularly in the expression of time and truth. Overall, the translation demonstrates clarity and aligns mostly with conservative interpretations of scripture, yet improvements are suggested for fidelity to the original nuances.

**MAT 13:46**: _(Grade 85.5)_

**Source**:
> ὃς εὑρὼν ἕνα πολύτιμον μαργαρίτην ἀπελθὼν πέπρακε πάντα ὅσα εἶχε καὶ ἠγόρασεν αὐτόν. ("Who, when he had found one pearl of great price, went and sold all that he had and bought it.")

**Translation**:
> Por fin descubre una verdadera oportunidad cuando le ofrecen a buen precio una perla de gran valor. Entonces corre, vende todo lo que tiene y la compra. ("Finally discovers a true opportunity when offered a pearl of great value at a good price. Then he runs, sells all he has, and buys it.")

**Suggested Translation**:
> «Cuando encuentra una perla de gran valor, se llena de alegría, vende todo lo que tiene y la compra.» ("When he finds a pearl of great value, he is filled with joy, sells all that he has, and buys it.")

**Combined Review**:
The translation of MAT 13:46 effectively conveys the essence of the verse while maintaining an accessible and modern style suitable for Latin American audiences. Phrases such as 'verdadera oportunidad' ("true opportunity") successfully capture the value of the pearl; however, the translation somewhat departs from the literal meaning of the original text, particularly with the phrase 'ofrecen a buen precio' ("offered at a good price"), which introduces an interpretive layer that may detract from the biblical emphasis on the pearl's intrinsic value. Simplifying certain phrases for clarity and maintaining the original text's rhythm could enhance its literary quality. Overall, the translation demonstrates a strong understanding of the task, achieving a balance between engagement and faithfulness to the scripture, while minor adjustments could improve clarity and alignment with biblical language norms.

**MAT 14:4**: _(Grade 85.5)_

**Source**:
> ἔλεγε γὰρ αὐτῷ ὁ Ἰωάννης· οὐκ ἔξεστί σοι ἔχειν αὐτήν. (For John said to him: It is not lawful for you to have her.)

**Translation**:
> Herodías odiaba a Juan, porque este se había atrevido a decirle al rey que era incorrecto que se casara con ella. (Herodias hated John, because he had dared to tell the king that it was wrong for him to marry her.)

**Suggested Translation**:
> Porque Juan le decía: «No te es lícito tener a esta mujer». (For John said to him: "It is not lawful for you to have this woman.")

**Combined Review**:
The translation of MAT 14:4 effectively conveys the main message of the original Greek text, capturing the moral rebuke from John the Baptist to Herod regarding his marriage to Herodias. While it maintains clarity and is accessible to a modern Spanish-speaking audience, it could improve in precision and fidelity to the original language. Specific phrases like 'se había atrevido a decirle al rey' (he had dared to tell the king) and 'era incorrecto' (it was wrong) may imply interpretive nuances that detract from John's authoritative stance, which is critical in this context. Additionally, the focus on Herodias's hatred should be balanced with the condemnation of the marriage to better reflect the weight of John's admonition. Overall, the translation is strong but could benefit from minor revisions to enhance its adherence to the original intent and context.

**MAT 16:3**: _(Grade 85.5)_

**Source**:
> καὶ πρωΐ· σήμερον χειμών· πυρράζει γὰρ στυγνάζων ὁ οὐρανός. [ὑποκριταί,] τὸ μὲν πρόσωπον τοῦ οὐρανοῦ γινώσκετε διακρίνειν, τὰ δὲ σημεῖα τῶν καιρῶν οὐ δύνασθε [γνῶναι]; (And in the morning: Today, there is a storm; for the sky is red and threatening. Hypocrites, you know how to discern the face of the sky, but you cannot discern the signs of the times?)  

**Translation**:
> y si por la mañana se pone rojo, saben que habrá tempestad. ¡Y sin embargo, no pueden leer las notorias señales de los tiempos! (and if in the morning it is red, you know there will be a storm. And yet, you cannot read the clear signs of the times!)

**Suggested Translation**:
> y si por la mañana se ve rojo, saben que habrá tempestad. ¡Hipócritas! (And if in the morning it looks red, you know there will be a storm. Hypocrites!) Sin embargo, no pueden discernir las claras señales de los tiempos. (However, they cannot discern the clear signs of the times.)

**Combined Review**:
The translation of MAT 16:3 generally conveys the original message well and is accessible for Spanish speakers. The phrase 'si por la mañana se pone rojo, saben que habrá tempestad' (if in the morning it is red, you know there will be a storm) effectively reflects Jesus' metaphor. However, there are suggestions for improving clarity and emphasis. The omission of '¡Hipócritas!' (Hypocrites!) reduces the gravity of Jesus' critique of the Pharisees, and the phrase 'las notorias señales de los tiempos' (the notorious signs of the times) might not capture the original's intent as strongly. Adjustments such as using 'se ve rojo' (looks red) instead of 'se pone rojo' (is red) could enhance clarity and directness. Overall, the translation is a solid effort but could benefit from refining the language for greater impact and faithfulness to the original text.

(Then he came to his disciples and said to them, 'Sleep, rest! Behold, the hour has come, and the Son of Man is delivered into the hands of sinners.')  

**Translation**:
> Cuando volvió a los discípulos les dijo:  
> «Duerman, descansen…, pero no, ha llegado la hora. Me van a entregar en manos de los pecadores. (When he returned to his disciples, he said to them, 'Sleep, rest… but no, the hour has come. They will hand me over to sinners.')  

**Suggested Translation**:
> «Ahora pueden descansar, pero ha llegado la hora. Me entregan en manos de los impíos.» ("Now you can rest, but the hour has come. They are handing me over to the wicked.")  

**Combined Review**:
The translation of MAT 26:45 is generally clear and accessible for Spanish speakers. It successfully maintains the essence of the original text, particularly in conveying Jesus' message. However, the phrase "Duerman, descansen..." ("Sleep, rest...") may come off as too casual, potentially lacking the gravity of the situation Jesus was facing. Most reviewers agree that while the translation effectively communicates the intended meaning, adjustments could enhance the emotional depth and urgency of Jesus' statement. Specifically, rephrasing the ending to better capture the seriousness of the moment, possibly using terms like "los impíos" ("the wicked") instead of "pecadores" ("sinners"), would add to the impact. Overall, the translation is a commendable effort but could benefit from minor refinements.

(No had finished speaking these words when Judas, one of the twelve, approached the front of a crowd armed with swords and clubs. They came in the name of the Jewish leaders and)

**Suggested Translation**:  
> No había terminado de hablar cuando Judas, uno de los doce, se acercó al frente de una multitud armada con espadas y palos, enviados por los líderes judíos y el pueblo.  
(No had finished speaking when Judas, one of the twelve, approached the front of a multitude armed with swords and clubs, sent by the Jewish leaders and the people.)

**Combined Review**:
The translation of MAT 26:47 effectively conveys the core meaning of the original Greek text and captures the context of Judas approaching Jesus with an armed crowd. The use of modern Spanish enhances accessibility for Latin American readers. However, several reviews highlighted issues with sentence flow and completeness. Specifically, there is a need for clarity regarding the crowd's purpose and the completion of sentences to ensure coherence. Suggested improvements include rephrasing certain phrases for better fluidity, such as changing "iba en nombre de los líderes judíos" (went in the name of the Jewish leaders) to clarify the collective authority behind the action, and addressing minor grammatical inconsistencies. Overall, the translation is strong but requires refinement in style and punctuation to enhance readability and emotional impact.

**Translation**:
> y lo colocó en un sepulcro nuevo labrado en la peña. Hacía poco que había hecho ese sepulcro y ordenó que rodaran una piedra grande para cerrar la entrada. José se alejó,  (and he placed it in a new tomb hewn in the rock. It had recently been made, and he ordered a large stone to roll away to close the entrance. Joseph went away,)

**Suggested Translation**:
> y lo colocó en un sepulcro nuevo, recién labrado en la roca, y puso una gran piedra para cerrar la entrada del sepulcro.  (and he placed it in a new tomb, recently hewn in the rock, and put a great stone to close the entrance of the tomb.)

**Combined Review**:
The translation of MAT 27:60 is generally well-executed, maintaining the core meaning of the original Greek text while employing modern language to enhance accessibility for contemporary Spanish readers. While the phrase 'Hacía poco que había hecho ese sepulcro' (It had recently been made) has been recognized by multiple reviewers as somewhat awkward and potentially misleading, it has been suggested that a more direct phrasing like 'recientemente había hecho' (had recently made) or 'Era un sepulcro nuevo, recién labrado en la roca' (It was a new tomb, recently hewn in the rock) may provide better clarity and flow. Furthermore, the use of 'ordenó que rodaran' (he ordered to roll) is considered overly formal for modern usage, and simplifying this could improve readability. Overall, the translation is effective but would benefit from minor revisions to ensure naturalness and engagement for the target audience.

(**Translation**: Zorobabel was the father of Abiud, and Abiud was the father of Eliakim, and Eliakim was the father of Azor.)

**Combined Review**:
The translation of MAT 1:13 is generally accurate, capturing the lineage presented in the original Greek text. However, several reviewers noted that the phrase "de" (of) lacks clarity about the relationships and suggested including phrases like "fue el padre de" (was the father of) for clarity. This would provide a more familiar and engaging reading experience, especially for those unfamiliar with genealogical terms. Reviewers emphasized that while the current translation is succinct, enhancements could be made by using conjunctions or modern equivalents that reflect common Spanish usage in biblical contexts. These minor adjustments would improve both clarity and fluidity, making the text more accessible and relatable for modern Spanish speakers, particularly in a Latin American context.

**Translation**:
> Danos hoy los alimentos que necesitamos, (Give us today the food we need)

**Suggested Translation**:
> Danos hoy nuestro pan de cada día, (Give us today our daily bread)

**Combined Review**:
Summary
The translation of MAT 6:11 as "Danos hoy los alimentos que necesitamos" (Give us today the food we need) is clear and accessible for Spanish speakers, particularly in a Latin American context. The translation successfully communicates the essence of the original Greek text, reflecting the request for daily sustenance. However, several reviews point out that the phrase 'los alimentos que necesitamos' (the food we need) is broader than 'pan' (bread), which may dilute the metaphorical significance of 'daily bread' in the biblical context. Most reviewers suggest that using the term 'pan' (bread) would align the translation more closely with the original text and its intended spiritual meaning. Overall, while the translation effectively meets the goal of accessibility, incorporating a term like 'pan' (bread) could enhance its fidelity to the source text and its theological depth. Therefore, the translation receives an average grade of 85, with room for improvement to capture the original's nuance.

**Combined Review**:
The translation of MAT 10:35 generally communicates the message of Jesus regarding familial conflict effectively and is accessible for modern Spanish speakers. However, there are several suggestions for improvement. Critics highlight that the phrase "a poner al hijo contra su padre" (to set the son against his father) could be seen as informal and suggest using "he venido a dividir" (I have come to divide) to better reflect the gravity of Jesus' message about division. Additionally, while the translation captures the essence of the original Greek, a more literal approach may enhance fidelity and clarity. There is a consensus that slight adjustments to maintain the serious tone and directness of the original text would strengthen the translation while still making it relatable for the intended audience. Overall, the translation is strong but would benefit from these enhancements.

The translation of MAT 11:12 is generally clear and captures the essence of the original Greek text. The phrase "se ha combatido mucho contra el reino de los cielos" (has been fought against the kingdom of heaven) effectively conveys the idea of struggle and resistance towards the kingdom of heaven, which aligns with the original meaning. However, the translation "los que son violentos luchan para acabar con él" (the violent are fighting to end it) may introduce a misunderstanding, implying opposition rather than an active pursuit of the kingdom. A more nuanced rendering would enhance clarity and align better with traditional interpretations that emphasize striving and earnestness. Overall, while the translation is accessible and modern for a Latin American audience, it could benefit from slight refinements for greater theological accuracy and adherence to a conservative Christian perspective.

**MAT 13:10**: _(Grade 85.8)_

**Source**:
> Καὶ προσελθόντες οἱ μαθηταὶ εἶπον αὐτῷ· διατί ἐν παραβολαῖς λαλεῖς αὐτοῖς; (And the disciples came to Him and said, "Why do You speak to them in parables?")

**Translation**:
> Sus discípulos se le acercaron y le dijeron: (His disciples came to Him and said to Him:)
> ―¿Por qué usas esos simbolismos tan difíciles de entender? ("Why do You use those difficult symbols to understand?")

**Suggested Translation**:
> Sus discípulos se le acercaron y le dijeron: (His disciples came to Him and said:)
> ―¿Por qué usas esas parábolas? ("Why do You use those parables?")

**Combined Review**:
The translation of MAT 13:10 effectively conveys the original Greek text and is generally clear and accessible for a Latin American audience. However, there is a consensus among reviewers that the phrase "simbolismos tan difíciles de entender" ("difficult symbols to understand") may undermine the gravity of Jesus’ message. A recommendation to use the term "parábolas" ("parables") instead of "simbolismos" ("symbols") would better reflect the storytelling nature of the original text. While the current translation achieves modern readability, minor adjustments in terminology could enhance its faithfulness and respect toward the spiritual significance of Jesus' teachings. Overall, a grade of 85 is warranted due to its strengths and the potential for refinement.

**MAT 14:20**: _(Grade 85.8)_

**Source**:
> καὶ ἔφαγον πάντες καὶ ἐχορτάσθησαν, καὶ ἦραν τὸ περισσεῦον τῶν κλασμάτων δώδεκα κοφίνους πλήρεις.  (And they all ate and were satisfied, and they took up the leftover pieces, twelve baskets full.)

**Translation**:
> Nadie se quedó sin comer. ¡Y hasta sobraron doce cestas de comida! (No one went without eating. And there were even twelve baskets of food left over!)

**Suggested Translation**:
> Todos comieron hasta saciarse, y recogieron doce cestas llenas de sobras. (Everyone ate until satisfied, and they collected twelve baskets full of leftovers.)

**Combined Review**:
The translation of MAT 14:20 effectively conveys the miracle of Jesus feeding the multitude in a modern and accessible style suitable for Latin American audiences. However, several reviews suggest improvements for clarity and theological significance. Phrases like "Nadie se quedó sin comer" (No one went without eating) could be refined to "Todos comieron hasta saciarse" (Everyone ate until satisfied) to better reflect the fullness of the miracle. The expression regarding leftovers may also be enhanced to maintain the sense of abundance and divine provision inherent in the original text. While the overall style is engaging and suitable for modern readers, minor adjustments would ensure both clarity and fidelity to the scriptural message.

**MAT 15:18**: _(Grade 85.8)_

**Source**:  
> τὰ δὲ ἐκπορευόμενα ἐκ τοῦ στόματος ἐκ τῆς καρδίας ἐξέρχεται, κἀκεῖνα κοινοῖ τὸν ἄνθρωπον.  
(But what comes out of the mouth proceeds from the heart, and this defiles a person.)

**Translation**:  
> pero el mal hablar brota de la suciedad del corazón y corrompe a la persona que así habla.  
(but evil speech springs from the filth of the heart and corrupts the person who speaks thus.)

**Suggested Translation**:  
> "Pero lo que sale de la boca proviene del corazón, y eso es lo que contamina al hombre."  
("But what comes out of the mouth proceeds from the heart, and this defiles a person.")

**Combined Review**:
The translation of MAT 15:18 generally conveys the core message effectively while being accessible for modern Spanish speakers. The phrase "pero el mal hablar brota de la suciedad del corazón y corrompe a la persona que así habla" (but evil speech springs from the filth of the heart and corrupts the person who speaks thus) communicates the essential idea, but the terms used may not fully reflect the spiritual and moral gravity present in the original Greek text. Suggested alternatives include using "maldad" (evil) or "malicia" (malice) instead of "suciedad" (filth) to better align with traditional translations that emphasize the seriousness of sin. Additionally, refining "mal hablar" (evil speech) to something like "los malos pensamientos" (the evil thoughts) could more accurately convey the nature of what corrupts a person. Overall, the translation is clear and relatable but could benefit from these adjustments to enhance both theological depth and reverence.

Overall Grade: 85.

**MAT 21:38**: _(Grade 85.8)_

**Source**:
> οἱ δὲ γεωργοὶ ἰδόντες τὸν υἱὸν εἶπον ἐν ἑαυτοῖς· οὗτός ἐστιν ὁ κληρονόμος· δεῦτε ἀποκτείνωμεν αὐτὸν καὶ κατάσχωμεν τὴν κληρονομίαν αὐτοῦ. (The farmers, seeing the son, said to themselves: "This is the heir; come, let us kill him and seize his inheritance.")

**Translation**:
> Pero cuando los labradores vieron que se acercaba, se dijeron: “Este no es nada menos que el heredero. Matémoslo y así nos quedaremos con la herencia.” (But when the farmers saw that he was approaching, they said: "This is nothing less than the heir. Let us kill him and so we will keep the inheritance.")

**Suggested Translation**:
> Pero cuando los labradores vieron que se acercaba, pensaron entre ellos: “Este es el heredero; matémoslo y así nos quedaremos con la herencia.” (But when the farmers saw that he was approaching, they thought among themselves: "This is the heir; let us kill him and so we will keep the inheritance.")

**Combined Review**:
The translation of MAT 21:38 effectively communicates the original message, with language that is accessible and engaging for Spanish speakers in Latin America. Reviews highlight the clarity and modernity of the translation, emphasizing its effectiveness in conveying the intended meaning. However, there are suggestions for improvement to enhance reverence and maintain theological depth. Specifically, phrases like "este no es nada menos que el heredero" (this is nothing less than the heir) may sound informal and could be revised to "Este es el heredero" (This is the heir) to better align with the seriousness of the context. Additionally, the phrasing of actions taken by the farmers may benefit from a slight adjustment to underscore the moral implications. Overall, while the translation meets the goal of being relatable and engaging, minor refinements would elevate its formal tone and fidelity to the original text.

**Source**:
> ὡμοιώθη ἡ βασιλεία τῶν οὐρανῶν ἀνθρώπῳ βασιλεῖ, ὅστις ἐποίησε γάμους τῷ υἱῷ αὐτοῦ. (The kingdom of heaven is likened to a king who made weddings for his son.)

**Translation**:
> «El reino de los cielos puede ilustrarse con el cuento de un rey que preparó un gran banquete en celebración de la boda de su hijo. (The kingdom of heaven can be illustrated with the story of a king who prepared a great banquet for his son's wedding.)

**Suggested Translation**:
> «El reino de los cielos se asemeja a un rey que preparó un gran banquete por la boda de su hijo. (The kingdom of heaven is like a king who prepared a great banquet for his son's wedding.)

**Combined Review**:
The translation of MAT 22:2 effectively captures the essence of the original Greek text while utilizing modern and accessible language for Spanish speakers. However, there are concerns regarding the use of the term "cuento" (story), which may undermine the reverence typically associated with biblical texts. Suggested alternatives such as "parábola" (parable) or "ejemplo" (example) would convey a more respectful tone and better reflect the gravity of the parable's message. The phrase "puede ilustrarse con" (can be illustrated with) is also considered less formal than what is suitable for biblical translation, and adjustments towards more solemn language could enhance the overall impact. While the translation maintains clarity and relatability, minor adjustments in terminology would provide a more faithful representation of the biblical text. Overall, the translation achieves its objective of accessibility but requires some revisions to align with conservative Christian perspectives.

**MAT 22:6**: _(Grade 85.8)_

**Source**:
> οἱ δὲ λοιποὶ κρατήσαντες τοὺς δούλους αὐτοῦ ὕβρισαν καὶ ἀπέκτειναν. (But the rest seized his servants, insulted them, and killed them.)

**Translation**:
> y los otros tomaron a los mensajeros y, tras golpearlos y afrentarlos, los mataron. (and the others took the messengers and, after beating and insulting them, killed them.)

**Suggested Translation**:
> y los demás tomaron a los siervos, los humillaron y los mataron. (and the others took the servants, humiliated them, and killed them.)

**Combined Review**:
The translation of MAT 22:6 effectively conveys the original text's essence, portraying the gravity of the situation where the messengers are violently treated. While the modern style makes it accessible for Spanish speakers, terms like 'afrentarlos' (to insult them) may not fully capture the stronger connotation of 'ὕβρισαν' (they insulted), which implies insult or blasphemy. The phrase 'los otros tomaron a los mensajeros' (the others took the messengers) could be improved for clarity by using 'los demás' (the others). The phrase 'tras golpearlos y afrentarlos' (after beating and insulting them) communicates violence and disrespect; however, the formality of terms in a biblical context, like 'siervos' (servants) instead of 'mensajeros' (messengers), would align better with traditional biblical language. Overall, the translation is strong but could enhance clarity and gravity in its word choices to more faithfully reflect the original text's intent. It meets objectives of accessibility while warranting some adjustments for traditional language usage.

**MAT 22:16**: _(Grade 85.8)_

**Source**:
> καὶ ἀποστέλλουσιν αὐτῷ τοὺς μαθητὰς αὐτῶν μετὰ τῶν Ἡρῳδιανῶν λέγοντες· διδάσκαλε, οἴδαμεν ὅτι ἀληθὴς εἶ καὶ τὴν ὁδὸν τοῦ Θεοῦ ἐν ἀληθείᾳ διδάσκεις, καὶ οὐ μέλει σοι περὶ οὐδενός· οὐ γὰρ βλέπεις εἰς πρόσωπον ἀνθρώπων· (And they sent to him their disciples, along with the Herodians, saying, "Teacher, we know that you are true and teach the way of God in truth, and you do not care about anyone's opinion, for you are not swayed by appearances.")

**Translation**:
> Decidieron enviar a algunos de sus hombres, juntamente con algunos herodianos, a formularle algunas preguntas. (They decided to send some of their men along with some Herodians to ask him some questions.) —Señor —le dijeron—, sabemos que amas la verdad y que la enseñas sin miedo a las consecuencias. ("Teacher," they said, "we know that you are true and that you teach the way of God in truth; you do not care about anyone's opinion, for you are not swayed by appearances.")

**Suggested Translation**:
> Decidieron enviar a algunos de sus hombres, junto con algunos herodianos, a formularle algunas preguntas. (They decided to send some of their men along with some Herodians to ask him some questions.) —Señor —le dijeron—, sabemos que eres verdadero y que enseñas el camino de Dios con verdad; no te importa lo que piensen los demás, porque no juzgas por apariencias. ("Teacher," they said, "we know that you are true and that you teach the way of God in truth; you do not care about anyone's opinion, for you are not swayed by appearances.")

**Combined Review**:
The translation of MAT 22:16 effectively captures the essence and meaning of the original Greek text while maintaining a clear and respectful tone. The use of modern and accessible Spanish makes it engaging for contemporary Latin American audiences. However, there are minor adjustments recommended to improve clarity, conciseness, and formality, particularly regarding phrases that may introduce interpretative bias or may not align with traditional biblical terminology. Additionally, while the informative note about the Herodians is helpful, it could be streamlined to maintain the flow of the text. Overall, the translation is solid and meets the objectives but could benefit from refinements to enhance clarity and reverence for the biblical message.

**MAT 22:35**: _(Grade 85.8)_

**Source**:
> καὶ ἐπηρώτησεν εἷς ἐξ αὐτῶν, νομικός, πειράζων αὐτὸν καὶ λέγων· (And one of them, a lawyer, asked him, testing him, and saying:)

**Translation**:
> y se les ocurrió una nueva idea. Uno de ellos, abogado, preguntó a Jesús: (and they came up with a new idea. One of them, a lawyer, asked Jesus:)

**Suggested Translation**:
> y uno de ellos, un abogado, le preguntó a Jesús: (and one of them, a lawyer, asked Jesus:)

**Combined Review**:
The translation of MAT 22:35 is generally effective, conveying the essence of the original text and ensuring accessibility for a modern Spanish-speaking audience. However, the phrase "se les ocurrió una nueva idea" (they came up with a new idea) might be too informal and could undermine the seriousness of the context, where the lawyer is intentionally testing Jesus. A more precise phrasing, such as "y uno de ellos, un abogado, le preguntó a Jesús," (and one of them, a lawyer, asked Jesus) would not only maintain clarity but also better reflect the gravity of the interaction. While the translation is clear and engaging, a slight shift towards a more formal tone would respect the sacred nature of the scripture, aligning it closer to the original intent and context.

**MAT 25:7**: _(Grade 85.8)_

**Source**:  
> τότε ἠγέρθησαν πᾶσαι αἱ παρθένοι ἐκεῖναι καὶ ἐκόσμησαν τὰς λαμπάδας αὐτῶν.  
(Then all those virgins arose and trimmed their lamps.)

**Translation**:  
> Las muchachas saltaron a arreglar las lámparas,  
(The girls jumped to fix the lamps,)

**Suggested Translation**:  
> Entonces las doncellas se levantaron a preparar sus lámparas.  
(Then the maidens arose to prepare their lamps.)

**Combined Review**:
The translation of MAT 25:7 as "Las muchachas saltaron a arreglar las lámparas" (The girls jumped to fix the lamps) effectively communicates the essence of the original Greek text in a modern and accessible manner. However, the term "muchachas" (girls) may lack the dignity and formality suitable for the characters in this parable, as "doncellas" (maidens) would resonate more with a conservative audience. The phrase "saltaron a arreglar" (jumped to fix) might imply joy or excitement that isn't present in the original context, potentially undermining the gravity and urgency intended in the parable. A more neutral or formal verb could enhance clarity while still engaging contemporary Spanish speakers. Overall, while the translation is commendable and effectively aligns with the goal of making the scripture accessible, slight adjustments in word choice could better reflect the traditional context of the text.

(Translated: A woman approached Him with an alabaster jar of very expensive perfume, and she poured it on His head as He reclined.)

**Translation**:
> Durante la cena, una mujer se le acercó con un frasco de un perfume costosísimo y se lo echó en la cabeza.  
(Translated: During dinner, a woman approached Him with a jar of very expensive perfume and poured it on His head.)

**Suggested Translation**:
> Durante la cena, una mujer se acercó a Él con un frasco de un perfume muy caro y se lo vertió sobre la cabeza.  
(Translated: During dinner, a woman approached Him with a jar of a very expensive perfume and poured it on His head.)

**Combined Review**:
The translation of MAT 26:7 is clear and modern, making it accessible for Spanish speakers in Latin America. While the original phrase "se lo echó en la cabeza" ("she poured it on His head") is understandable, a more formal expression such as "se lo vertió sobre la cabeza" ("she poured it over His head") could better reflect the biblical tone. Additionally, while "costosísimo" ("very expensive") conveys the high value of the perfume, the phrase "muy caro" ("very expensive") might resonate more colloquially. It's important to maintain the gravity of the original Greek text while ensuring clarity for contemporary readers. Overall, the translation effectively captures the essence of the original while allowing for minor adjustments to enhance formal tone and fluidity.

**MAT 26:17**: _(Grade 85.8)_

**Source**:
> Τῇ δὲ πρώτῃ τῶν ἀζύμων προσῆλθον οἱ μαθηταὶ τῷ Ἰησοῦ λέγοντες αὐτῷ· ποῦ θέλεις ἑτοιμάσωμέν σοι φαγεῖν τὸ πάσχα; (On the first day of the Feast of Unleavened Bread, the disciples came to Jesus, saying to Him, "Where do you want us to prepare for you to eat the Passover?")

**Translation**:
> El primer día de las ceremonias pascuales en que los judíos se abstenían de comer pan con levadura, los discípulos le preguntaron a Jesús:
> ―¿Dónde quieres que preparemos la cena de Pascua? (The first day of the Passover ceremonies when the Jews refrained from eating leavened bread, the disciples asked Jesus: "Where do you want us to prepare the Passover dinner?")

**Suggested Translation**:
> El primer día de la Fiesta de los Panes Sin Levadura, los discípulos se acercaron a Jesús y le preguntaron:
> ―¿Dónde quieres que preparemos la Pascua? (The first day of the Feast of Unleavened Bread, the disciples approached Jesus and asked Him: "Where do you want us to prepare the Passover?")

**Combined Review**:
The translation of MAT 26:17 effectively communicates the essence of the original Greek text, with clear and modern Spanish that resonates well with the Latin American audience. While it successfully captures the significance of the Passover preparations, there are several suggestions for improvement:  
- Simplify the phrase "en que los judíos se abstenían de comer pan con levadura" (when the Jews refrained from eating leavened bread) to enhance clarity, as it may confuse some readers unfamiliar with unleavened bread. Suggestions include using "cuando los judíos celebraban la Pascua" (when the Jews celebrated Passover) or simply stating the event during the Feast of Unleavened Bread.  
- Consider rephrasing "cena de Pascua" (Passover dinner) to "celebración de la Pascua" (celebration of Passover) or just "Pascua" (Passover) to better align with contemporary Christian terminology and maintain a reverent tone suitable for biblical text.  
Overall, the translation meets the goal of making the Bible more accessible, but minor adjustments in phrasing would enhance engagement and clarity for the target audience.

> Ἐν ἐκείνῃ τῇ ὥρᾳ εἶπεν ὁ Ἰησοῦς τοῖς ὄχλοις· ὡς ἐπὶ λῃστὴν ἐξήλθετε μετὰ μαχαιρῶν καὶ ξύλων συλλαβεῖν με· καθ᾽ ἡμέραν πρὸς ὑμᾶς ἐκαθεζόμην διδάσκων ἐν τῷ ἱερῷ, καὶ οὐκ ἐκρατήσατέ με.  
(At that hour, Jesus said to the crowds: "Have you come out against me as a robber, with swords and clubs to seize me? I sat daily with you teaching in the temple, and you did not seize me.")

**Translation**:
> Luego dijo a la turba:  
> ―¿Soy acaso un asesino tan peligroso que tienen que venir con espadas y palos a arrestarme? Todos estos días he estado enseñando en el templo y no me detuvieron.  
(Then he said to the crowd: "Am I really such a dangerous criminal that you come to arrest me with swords and clubs? All these days I have been teaching in the temple, and you did not stop me.")

**Suggested Translation**:
> Luego Jesús se dirigió a la multitud:  
> —¿Acaso soy un criminal tan peligroso que vienen a arrestarme con espadas y palos? Todos estos días he estado enseñando en el templo y no me detuvieron.  
(Then Jesus turned to the crowd: "Am I really such a dangerous criminal that you come to arrest me with swords and clubs? All these days I have been teaching in the temple, and you did not stop me.")

**Combined Review**:
The translation of MAT 26:55 has been generally well-received for its clarity and modern accessibility, particularly for Latin American audiences. While it successfully conveys the intended message, concerns have been raised regarding the phrase "¿Soy acaso un asesino tan peligroso..." ("Am I really such a dangerous criminal...") which shifts the tone, implying a casual or sarcastic questioning rather than maintaining the gravity of Jesus' situation. Several reviews suggest that using a more direct term like "ladrón" ("thief") would better reflect the original text's emphasis on the contrast between the violent reaction of the crowd and Jesus' peaceful teachings. Overall, while the translation captures the essence of the original text, improvements in precision and tone could enhance its faithfulness to the Scripture and its reverence in a biblical context.

**MAT 28:17**: _(Grade 85.8)_

**Source**:
> καὶ ἰδόντες αὐτὸν προσεκύνησαν αὐτῷ, οἱ δὲ ἐδίστασαν. (And when they saw him, they worshiped him, but some doubted.)

**Translation**:
> Cuando lo vieron, lo adoraron, aunque algunos no estaban completamente convencidos de que en realidad era Jesús. (When they saw him, they worshiped him, although some were not completely convinced that he was actually Jesus.)

**Suggested Translation**:
> Cuando lo vieron, lo adoraron; algunos dudaron. (When they saw him, they worshiped; some doubted.)

**Combined Review**:
The translation of Matthew 28:17 generally captures the essence of the original Greek text, portraying the act of worship the disciples expressed upon seeing the risen Jesus. However, the phrase "aunque algunos no estaban completamente convencidos de que en realidad era Jesús" (although some were not completely convinced that he was actually Jesus) introduces an element of doubt that is not present in the original text. This could lead to ambiguity regarding the disciples' faith, which a conservative Christian perspective might find troubling as it could undermine the acknowledgment of Jesus' identity and authority. A more straightforward rendering, such as "algunos dudaron" (some doubted), would maintain fidelity to the original meaning without adding unnecessary interpretative layers. While the translation is accessible and resonates well with modern Spanish speakers, it would benefit from stronger alignment with the definitive nature of worship and recognition of Jesus’ divinity as portrayed in the biblical context. Overall, the translation is well-executed but requires some adjustments to enhance its accuracy and faithfulness to the source text's intent.

**Translation**:
> Óiganme lo que les digo: Muchos gentiles, al igual que este soldado romano, irán de todas partes del mundo a sentarse en el reino de los cielos con Abraham, Isaac y Jacob. ("Listen to me: Many Gentiles, just like this Roman soldier, will come from all over the world to sit in the kingdom of heaven with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.")

**Suggested Translation**:
> Les digo que muchos vendrán de diferentes lugares y se sentarán junto a Abraham, Isaac y Jacob en el reino de los cielos. ("I tell you that many will come from different places and sit with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven.")

**Combined Review**:
The translation of MAT 8:11 is generally well done, effectively communicating the core message of Jesus regarding the inclusion of Gentiles in the Kingdom of Heaven. However, some phrases could be refined for greater precision and reverence. The opening phrase 'Óiganme lo que les digo' ("Listen to me: What I say to you") is perceived as informal and could be simplified. The use of 'gentiles' ("Gentiles") while appropriate, could be adjusted for better clarity and accessibility for contemporary readers. Additionally, the comparison of the centurion to the Gentiles may need to be approached more cautiously to maintain the original intent. Overall, the translation is engaging for Latin American audiences but can benefit from slight modifications for accuracy and fluidity.

**MAT 13:15**: _(Grade 86.0)_

**Source**:
> ἐπαχύνθη γὰρ ἡ καρδία τοῦ λαοῦ τούτου, καὶ τοῖς ὠσὶ βαρέως ἤκουσαν, καὶ τοὺς ὀφθαλμοὺς αὐτῶν ἐκάμμυσαν, μήποτε ἴδωσι τοῖς ὀφθαλμοῖς καὶ τοῖς ὠσὶν ἀκούσωσι καὶ τῇ καρδίᾳ συνῶσι καὶ ἐπιστρέψωσι, καὶ ἰάσομαι αὐτούς. (For this people's heart has grown dull, and their ears are hard of hearing, and their eyes they have closed, lest they should see with their eyes and hear with their ears, lest they should understand with their hearts and turn, so that I should heal them.)

**Translation**:
> porque tienen el corazón endurecido (for they have hardened their hearts), no oyen bien (do not hear well) y tienen los ojos cerrados (and have their eyes closed). Por lo tanto, no verán ni oirán ni entenderán ni se convertirán ni dejarán que yo los sane (therefore, they will neither see nor hear nor understand nor convert, nor will they allow me to heal them).

**Suggested Translation**:
> porque el corazón de este pueblo se ha vuelto insensible (because the heart of this people has become insensitive); han oído, pero no oyen correctamente (they have heard, but do not hear correctly), han cerrado sus ojos para no ver (they have closed their eyes so as not to see); así no perciben ni entienden, ni se convierten, ni les permito recibir la sanidad (thus they do not perceive nor understand, nor do I allow them to receive healing).

**Combined Review**:
The translation of MAT 13:15 effectively captures the essence of the original Greek text, reflecting the spiritual state of the people Jesus is addressing. The phrase 'corazón endurecido' (hardened heart) accurately conveys the intended meaning, highlighting the seriousness of spiritual insensitivity. However, there are suggestions to improve clarity and reverence in the tone, particularly with phrases like 'no oyen bien' (do not hear well), which could be rephrased to 'no oyen correctamente' (do not hear correctly) for a more formal approach. Additionally, the ending phrase 'y dejan que yo los sane' (and they allow me to heal them) might imply passivity regarding healing, which should be re-evaluated to maintain the original Greek's emphasis on refusal. Overall, while the translation is accessible and appropriate for contemporary Spanish speakers, minor adjustments in phrasing and emphasis could enhance both clarity and theological integrity.

(Translation: "They brought the donkey and the colt, and laid their clothes on them, and He sat on them.")

**Translation**:
> y poco después regresaron con los animales. Pusieron luego sus mantos encima del burrito para que Jesús se montara.  
(Translation: "and shortly thereafter they returned with the animals. They then placed their cloaks on the donkey for Jesus to ride.")

**Suggested Translation**:
> Los discípulos llevaron la burra y el potro, y pusieron sobre ellos sus mantos; y Jesús se montó en ellos.  
(Translation: "The disciples brought the donkey and the colt, and they laid their cloaks on them; and Jesus sat on them.")

**Combined Review**:
The translation of Matthew 21:7 generally captures the essence of the original Greek text effectively while using modern, accessible Spanish. While the overall structure is clear and relatable, several reviewers noted that the phrase "poco después regresaron con los animales" (shortly thereafter they returned with the animals) introduces a sense of delay that is not present in the original text. Instead, terms like "trajeron" or "llevaron" (brought or carried) would be more direct and maintain the immediacy of the action. The term 'burrito' (little donkey) is seen as somewhat informal, and in a conservative context, alternatives such as 'potro' (colt) or 'asno' (donkey) may be preferable to reflect the reverence due to Jesus. Despite these concerns, the translation remains engaging and successfully meets the goal of accessibility for Spanish-speaking audiences. Minor adjustments are recommended for improved clarity and adherence to the source text.

**Translation**:
> Cuando se acercó el tiempo de la cosecha, envió a empleados suyos a recoger lo que le correspondía.  (When the time of the harvest drew near, he sent his employees to collect what was due to him.)

**Suggested Translation**:
> Cuando se acercó el tiempo de la cosecha, envió a sus siervos a recoger los frutos de su viña.  (When the time of the harvest drew near, he sent his servants to collect the fruits of his vineyard.)

**Combined Review**:
The translation of MAT 21:34 is generally clear and effectively communicates the original meaning. While the phrase "Cuando se acercó el tiempo de la cosecha, envió a empleados suyos a recoger lo que le correspondía" (When the time of the harvest drew near, he sent his employees to collect what was due to him) captures the essence of the parable well, several reviewers suggested that the term "empleados" (employees) be replaced with "siervos" (servants) or "dólares" (a misinterpretation in the original, as it means 'dollars' in Spanish, which is not applicable here) to better align with biblical terminology and convey the original connotation of servanthood. Additionally, using the phrase "a recoger los frutos de su viña" (to collect the fruits of his vineyard) was recommended for clarity and fidelity to the source material. Overall, the translation meets accessibility objectives while maintaining theological integrity, but could benefit from slight refinements to enhance clarity and respect for the original text.

**Translation**:
> Y dicen que se puede jurar en vano por el altar, pero si se jura en vano por lo que está sobre el altar, lo condenan. (And they say that one can swear in vain by the altar, but if one swears in vain by what is on the altar, it condemns.)

**Suggested Translation**:
> Y dicen que jurar en vano por el altar no cuenta, pero si alguien jura por lo que está sobre el altar, eso sí es condenable. (And they say that swearing in vain by the altar doesn't count, but if someone swears by what is on the altar, that is indeed condemnable.)

**Combined Review**:
The translation of MAT 23:18 effectively captures the essence of the original Greek text, conveying the seriousness of the message regarding the integrity of oaths in religious practices. While the phrasing is accessible and modern for a Latin American audience, several reviewers noted that the phrase "se puede jurar en vano" may oversimplify the gravity of the original message. A more direct expression, such as "pueden jurar sin valor," could better reflect the severity intended by Jesus' critique of hypocrisy. Overall, while the translation is clear and understandable, a few adjustments in word choice and phrasing could enhance theological precision and convey the seriousness of oaths more effectively.

> ἀκούσας δὲ ὅτι Ἀρχέλαος βασιλεύει ἐπὶ τῆς Ἰουδαίας ἀντὶ Ἡρῴδου τοῦ πατρὸς αὐτοῦ, ἐφοβήθη ἐκεῖ ἀπελθεῖν· χρηματισθεὶς δὲ κατ᾽ ὄναρ ἀνεχώρησεν εἰς τὰ μέρη τῆς Γαλιλαίας, (Hearing that Archelaus was reigning over Judea instead of Herod his father, he was afraid to go there; but after being warned in a dream, he withdrew to the regions of Galilee.)

**Translation**:
> Luego Dios le indicó en sueños que fuera a Galilea; (Then God indicated to him in a dream to go to Galilee)

**Combined Review**:
The translation of MAT 2:22 maintains the essential meaning of the original Greek text while using modern and accessible language for Spanish speakers. However, there are several areas for improvement. The phrase "Dios le indicó en sueños" (God indicated to him in a dream) could benefit from more precise wording to better capture the Greek term "χρηματισθεὶς" (having been divinely instructed), which implies a direct divine command; alternatives such as "instruyó" (instructed) or "mandó" (commanded) may be more appropriate. Additionally, clarifying that it was through a dream and the mention of Joseph's fear when considering the journey to Galilee would enhance accuracy and depth. Some suggestions include rephrasing to specify divine intervention and ensure clarity about Joseph's feelings. Overall, while the translation is engaging and contemporary, these minor adjustments could strengthen its faithfulness to the original text and improve overall clarity.

**MAT 5:5**: _(Grade 86.3)_

**Source**:
> μακάριοι οἱ πραεῖς, ὅτι αὐτοὶ κληρονομήσουσι τὴν γῆν.  (Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the earth.)

**Translation**:
> ¡Dichosos los mansos, porque el mundo entero les pertenecerá!  (Blessed are the meek, for the whole world will belong to them!)

**Combined Review**:
The translation of Matthew 5:5, "¡Dichosos los mansos, porque el mundo entero les pertenecerá!" (Blessed are the meek, for the whole world will belong to them!) effectively conveys the essence of the original Greek text. However, the phrase "el mundo entero les pertenecerá" (the whole world will belong to them) is not an accurate reflection of the original meaning, which emphasizes inheriting "the earth" rather than suggesting general ownership of the world. A more appropriate translation would be to use "heredarán la tierra" (they shall inherit the earth) to align with traditional scriptural language and ensure theological accuracy. The term "mansos" (meek) is acceptable in a modern context but may not fully capture the nuance of "gentle" or "meek." Overall, while the translation remains accessible and engaging for Spanish speakers, slight adjustments could enhance its fidelity to the original text's intended meaning. Therefore, the review concludes with a score of 85 for clarity and modern language use, with notes on improving precision in theological interpretation.

**Source**:  
> καὶ ἰδοὺ σεισμὸς μέγας ἐγένετο ἐν τῇ θαλάσσῃ, ὥστε τὸ πλοῖον καλύπτεσθαι ὑπὸ τῶν κυμάτων· αὐτὸς δὲ ἐκάθευδε.  
> (And behold, there arose a great storm in the sea, so that the boat was covered with waves; but he was asleep.)

**Translation**:  
> Durante la travesía se quedó dormido.  
> (During the crossing, he fell asleep.)  
> Poco después se levantó una tormenta tan violenta que las olas inundaban la barca.  
> (Soon after, a violent storm arose, causing the waves to flood the boat.)

**Combined Review**:
The translation of MAT 8:24 is generally clear and accessible for contemporary Spanish-speaking audiences, effectively capturing the essence of the original Greek text. While the modern style resonates well with Latin American readers, there are areas for improvement to enhance the reverence and emotional depth of the narrative. Suggestions include adjusting phrases like "Durante la travesía se quedó dormido" (During the crossing, he fell asleep) to a more reverent form, and ensuring the dramatic tension of the storm and Jesus' calmness is vividly depicted. Additionally, minor changes to improve flow and accuracy, such as more directly stating that Jesus was asleep when the storm arose, could provide a clearer sequence of events. Overall, this is a commendable effort that meets its goal of making the scripture engaging and understandable, yet it allows for further refinement in expressiveness and fidelity to the biblical context.

**MAT 14:16**: _(Grade 86.3)_

**Source**:
> ὁ δὲ Ἰησοῦς εἶπεν αὐτοῖς· οὐ χρείαν ἔχουσιν ἀπελθεῖν· δότε αὐτοῖς ὑμεῖς φαγεῖν. (But Jesus said to them, "They do not need to go away. You give them something to eat.")

**Translation**:
> ―¿Por qué? (Why?)  
> —les respondió Jesús—. (Jesus answered them)  
> ¡Denles ustedes de comer! (Give them something to eat!)

**Combined Review**:
The translation of MAT 14:16 effectively communicates the original message while maintaining a modern and accessible style suitable for Latin American Spanish speakers. While the directive "¡Denles ustedes de comer!" (Give them something to eat!) captures the essence of Jesus' command well, the opening phrase “¿Por qué?” (Why?) may create confusion by implying a questioning of the disciples rather than a straightforward response. It has been suggested that this could be revised to enhance clarity, potentially rephrasing it to "No necesitan irse; ustedes denles de comer" (They do not need to go away; you give them something to eat) for a more immediate impact. Additionally, improvements in punctuation and structure could provide greater clarity and align with traditional biblical translations that may be preferred by conservative Christian audiences. Overall, the translation is engaging and fulfills the objective of accessibility, though careful attention to phrasing and nuance is recommended for clarity.

**MAT 18:17**: _(Grade 86.3)_

**Source**:
> ἐὰν δὲ παρακούσῃ αὐτῶν, εἰπὲ τῇ ἐκκλησίᾳ· ἐὰν δὲ καὶ τῆς ἐκκλησίας παρακούσῃ, ἔστω σοι ὥσπερ ὁ ἐθνικὸς καὶ ὁ τελώνης.  
(If he refuses to listen to them, tell it to the church; and if he refuses to listen even to the church, let him be to you as a Gentile and a tax collector.)

**Translation**:
> Si se niega a escucharte, presenta el caso a la iglesia, y si esta se pronuncia a tu favor y tu hermano no acepta la recomendación de la iglesia, entonces la iglesia debe expulsarlo.  
(If he refuses to listen to them, tell it to the church; and if he refuses to listen even to the church, let him be to you as a Gentile and a tax collector.)

**Combined Review**:
The translation of MAT 18:17 generally conveys the meaning of the original Greek text effectively, making it accessible to Spanish speakers in contemporary contexts. Reviews consistently praise the clarity of the translation, especially the phrase 'presenta el caso a la iglesia' (present the case to the church) which reflects community accountability. However, multiple reviewers pointed out that the phrase 'la iglesia debe expulsarlo' (the church must expel him) might be perceived as too harsh or lacking in the spirit of reconciliation that this scripture aims to convey. Suggestions were made to consider more pastoral language that emphasizes restoration rather than expulsion. Additionally, clarity regarding the church's role in upholding biblical principles without appearing to take sides was also noted. Overall, the translation is strong and aligns with conservative Christian interpretations but could benefit from minor adjustments in tone and phrasing for enhanced pastoral sensitivity and clarity.

> μὴ ἔχοντος δὲ αὐτοῦ ἀποδοῦναι ἐκέλευσεν αὐτὸν ὁ κύριος αὐτοῦ πραθῆναι καὶ τὴν γυναῖκα αὐτοῦ καὶ τὰ τέκνα καὶ πάντα ὅσα εἶχε, καὶ ἀποδοθῆναι. ("But since he could not pay, his master ordered him to be sold, and his wife and children and all that he had, and payment to be made.")

**Translation**:
> Como no podía pagarle, el rey ordenó que lo vendieran como esclavo, y también a su esposa, a sus hijos y sus posesiones. ("Since he could not pay, the king ordered that he be sold as a slave, along with his wife, his children, and his possessions.")

**Combined Review**:
The translation of MAT 18:25 effectively conveys the original text's meaning, retaining the context of debt and consequences. It utilizes clear and accessible language for modern Spanish-speaking audiences. However, suggestions for improvement include:
1. Using a more precise term than 'esclavo' to better reflect servitude in this context, enhancing clarity regarding forgiveness and grace.
2. Adopting a slightly more formal structure in phrases to reflect the gravity of the situation, for instance, "el rey ordenó que fuera vendido como esclavo" instead of "que lo vendieran como esclavo."
3. Considering alternatives to the term 'cien millones de pesos' for 'μυρίων ταλάντων' to represent the biblical context of the enormous debt more accurately.
4. Ensuring the phrase 'todas sus posesiones' is more explicit as 'todas sus pertenencias' for better reflection of the original meaning.  

Overall, the translation is a strong effort toward accessibility but could benefit from minor adjustments to improve fidelity and formal tone, achieving a rating of 85 to 90 across individual reviews.

**MAT 18:31**: _(Grade 86.3)_  

**Source**:  
> ἰδόντες δὲ οἱ σύνδουλοι αὐτοῦ τὰ γενόμενα ἐλυπήθησαν σφόδρα, καὶ ἐλθόντες διεσάφησαν τῷ κυρίῳ ἑαυτῶν πάντα τὰ γενόμενα.  
(Seeing this, his fellow servants were very upset, and they went and reported to their lord all that had happened.)  

**Translation**:  
> Los amigos del encarcelado, entristecidos, acudieron al rey y le contaron lo sucedido.  
(Literal translation: The friends of the imprisoned one, saddened, went to the king and told him what happened.)  

**Combined Review**:
The translation of MAT 18:31 is generally well-executed, effectively capturing the essence of the original Greek text while maintaining accessibility for modern Spanish speakers. The term "Los amigos del encarcelado" (The friends of the imprisoned one) is viewed as too casual and informal for the context; alternatives such as "los compañeros" (the companions) or "los siervos" (the servants) are suggested to reflect the more serious tone and nature of the relationship indicated by the Greek word 'σύνδουλοι' (fellow servants). The emotional weight of the term "entristecidos" (saddened) is acknowledged as appropriate, but there is a call for slight adjustments in vocabulary to enhance fidelity to the serious message of accountability and consequences reflected in the scripture. Overall, while the translation achieves its purpose and is understandable, refining the terminology would better align it with a conservative Christian perspective and the contextual nuances of the biblical narrative.

**MAT 20:27**: _(Grade 86.3)_

**Source**:
> καὶ ὃς ἐὰν θέλῃ ἐν ὑμῖν εἶναι πρῶτος, ἔσται ὑμῶν δοῦλος·  (And whoever wishes to be first among you must be your servant.)

**Translation**:
> y el que quiera ocupar el primer lugar en la lista de honor debe ser esclavo de los demás. (and whoever wants to be first must be a slave to all.)

**Combined Review**:
The translation of MAT 20:27, "y el que quiera ocupar el primer lugar en la lista de honor debe ser esclavo de los demás," is generally accurate and effectively conveys the essence of Jesus' teaching on servanthood and humility in a modern and accessible way for Spanish speakers. However, the term "esclavo" (slave) might evoke strong negative connotations in contemporary contexts, potentially detracting from the intended message of service. Several reviewers suggested that alternatives such as "siervo" (servant) or "servidor" (server) could better resonate with audiences, particularly within conservative Christian frameworks that emphasize servitude as a form of humility. While the translation meets its objectives, slight adjustments in word choice could enhance relatability and engagement with the intended audience.

**MAT 21:4**: _(Grade 86.3)_  

**Source**:  
> τοῦτο δὲ ὅλον γέγονεν ἵνα πληρωθῇ τὸ ῥηθὲν διὰ τοῦ προφήτου λέγοντος· (This whole thing took place to fulfill what was spoken through the prophet, saying:)  

**Translation**:  
> Así se cumplió la antigua profecía: (Thus the ancient prophecy was fulfilled:)  

**Combined Review**:
The translation of MAT 21:4, "Así se cumplió la antigua profecía:", effectively conveys the essence of the original Greek text and reflects a modern, accessible style that aligns well with the goal of engaging Spanish speakers. However, the term 'la antigua profecía' may lack specificity and reverence, with suggestions to refer to 'la profecía de Zacarías' or 'lo que fue dicho por el profeta' (what was said by the prophet) to provide clearer context. While the current phrasing communicates the fulfillment of prophecy, adding a direct reference to the specific prophet could enhance understanding and depth, especially for a conservative audience that values the continuity of biblical prophecies. Overall, the translation is strong but could be improved with minor adjustments to clarify the prophetic aspect.

**MAT 24:48**: _(Grade 86.3)_

**Source**:
> ἐὰν δὲ εἴπῃ ὁ κακὸς δοῦλος ἐκεῖνος ἐν τῇ καρδίᾳ αὐτοῦ, χρονίζει ὁ κύριός μου ἐλθεῖν, (If that evil servant says in his heart, 'My lord is delaying his coming,')

**Translation**:
> »Pero si son tan malvados que, creyendo que voy a tardar en venir, (But if they are so wicked that, believing I will delay in coming,)

**Combined Review**:
The translation of MAT 24:48 generally captures the essence of the original Greek text while aiming for accessibility for modern Spanish speakers. Phrases like 'Pero si son tan malvados que, creyendo que voy a tardar en venir,' (But if they are so wicked that, believing I will delay in coming,) effectively convey the meaning but could be refined for a more formal tone, as traditionally expected in biblical translations. The use of 'malvados' (wicked) aligns with conservative interpretations, yet phrases such as 'tan malvados' (so wicked) and 'creyendo que' (believing that) could be seen as informal and may detract from the weightiness of the scripture. Suggestions for improvement include adopting a more traditional phrasing like 'si el siervo malo dijere en su corazón' (if the wicked servant says in his heart) to better reflect the seriousness and reverence for the text. Overall, the translation serves its purpose well, with clear language and effective engagement, but could benefit from a slight adjustment in tone and fidelity to the original wording.

**Translation**:
> ¿No sabes que podría pedirle a mi Padre que me enviara doce mil ángeles y me los enviaría al instante? (Do you not know that I could ask my Father to send me twelve thousand angels, and He would send them immediately?)

**Combined Review**:
_(Average Grade: 86.3)_: The translation of MAT 26:53 effectively captures the essence of the original Greek text while making it accessible to a modern Spanish-speaking audience. The phrase, "¿No sabes que podría pedirle a mi Padre que me enviara doce mil ángeles y me los enviaría al instante?" (Do you not know that I could ask my Father to send me twelve thousand angels, and He would send them immediately?) conveys both the power of Jesus and the urgency of His situation. However, there is a consensus that the translation should retain the term "doce legiones" (twelve legions) instead of "doce mil ángeles" (twelve thousand angels) to preserve the theological significance and gravity of the message. The original term connects with Roman military context, suggesting authority and divine power. While the modern language choice is appropriate, emphasizing this aspect of authority is crucial from a conservative Christian perspective. Overall, it is a solid translation that meets the objective, with a recommendation for minor adjustments to enhance theological fidelity.

**MAT 27:50**: _(Grade 86.3)_

**Source**:
> ὁ δὲ Ἰησοῦς πάλιν κράξας φωνῇ μεγάλῃ ἀφῆκε τὸ πνεῦμα. (And Jesus cried out again with a loud voice and yielded up his spirit.)

**Translation**:
> Jesús habló de nuevo con voz muy fuerte, y murió. (Jesus spoke again with a very loud voice, and died.)

**Combined Review**:
The translation of MAT 27:50 captures the essence of the original text but can be improved for greater accuracy and emotional weight. While the phrase "Jesús habló de nuevo con voz muy fuerte, y murió" (Jesus spoke again with a very loud voice, and died) conveys the overall meaning, it lacks the impactful rendering of Jesus 'crying out' which underscores the intensity and significance of His final moments. Suggestions such as using "Jesús gritó de nuevo con voz fuerte, y entregó su espíritu" (Jesus shouted again with a strong voice, and yielded up His spirit) provide a more direct and powerful connection to the original Greek. This would align better with traditional translations and conservative theological interpretations, emphasizing the dramatic nature of Jesus's sacrifice. Overall, while the translation is accessible to modern Spanish speakers, minor adjustments could enhance both its clarity and theological depth.

(Just as the tares are gathered and burned in the fire, so it will be at the end of this age.)  

**Translation**:  
> De la misma manera que los segadores separan el trigo de la mala hierba y queman esta, en el fin del mundo  
(Just as the reapers separate the wheat from the weeds and burn the latter, at the end of the world)  

**Combined Review**:
The translation of Matthew 13:40 effectively conveys the essential message of the original Greek text while maintaining clarity and accessibility for Spanish-speaking audiences. It uses modern language that resonates well with a Latin American context. However, there are suggestions for improvement:  
1. A more precise term than "mala hierba" (weeds) might enhance the formal tone of the passage.  
2. The phrase "en el fin del mundo" (at the end of the world) could be better expressed as "al final del mundo" (at the end of the world) for clarity.  
3. Including the action of sending angels, which is vital for the complete understanding of the parable's context, could strengthen the translation further.  
Overall, the translation is strong but could benefit from these minor adjustments to enhance theological nuances and ensure a full representation of the scriptural context.

 ("The Son of Man will send His angels, and they will gather out of His kingdom all things that offend and those who practice lawlessness.")

**Translation**:
> enviaré a mis ángeles a arrancar del reino a los que tientan a los demás y a los que hacen el mal.  
 ("I will send my angels to uproot from the kingdom those who tempt others and those who do evil.")

**Combined Review**:
The translation of Matthew 13:41 is overall clear and modern, making it accessible for Spanish speakers, particularly in Latin America. It successfully conveys the core message of divine judgment central to a conservative Christian interpretation. However, there are concerns regarding the term "tientan," which may dilute the broader implications of the original Greek term "σκάνδαλα" (scandals). A more direct reference to scandals could enhance theological accuracy and clarity, ensuring it better reflects the seriousness of leading others into sin. Suggestions for minor adjustments include reinforcing the original text's focus on causing offenses and iniquity. While the translation is strong, enhancing fidelity to the source text would improve its overall impact.

**Translation**:
> ¿Son ustedes siervos sabios y fieles a quienes el Señor ha encomendado la tarea de realizar los quehaceres de su casa y proporcionar a sus hijos el alimento cotidiano? (Are you wise and faithful servants to whom the Lord has entrusted the task of managing the duties of His house and providing for His children the daily food?)

**Combined Review**:
Summary
The translation of Matthew 24:45 generally captures the essence of the original text well, presenting a clear and modern interpretation that resonates with Spanish speakers in Latin America. The use of familiar language makes the scripture more accessible, aligning with the goal of engaging a contemporary audience. However, the phrase 'realizar los quehaceres de su casa' (to carry out the chores of His house) may be viewed as too colloquial and might better reflect the intended seriousness of the servant's responsibility with a more specific term such as 'cuidar de su casa' (to take care of His house) or 'darles la comida en su debido tiempo' (to give them food in due time). The term 'alimento cotidiano' (daily food) could also be simplified to 'el alimento diario' (the daily food) to enhance relatability. Overall, while the translation is solid and effective, slight adjustments are recommended for greater precision and clarity.

**MAT 1:19**: _(Grade 86.7)_

**Source**:
> Ἰωσὴφ δὲ ὁ ἀνὴρ αὐτῆς, δίκαιος ὢν καὶ μὴ θέλων αὐτὴν παραδειγματίσαι, ἐβουλήθη λάθρα ἀπολῦσαι αὐτήν.  (Joseph her husband, being a just man, and not wanting to make her a public example, was minded to put her away secretly.)

**Translation**:
> José, su novio, como era un hombre recto, quiso romper el compromiso en secreto, para no manchar el buen nombre de la joven.  (Joseph, her betrothed, being a righteous man, was unwilling to expose her to public disgrace, and resolved to divorce her quietly.)

**Combined Review**:
The translation of Matthew 1:19 is generally well-executed, with a modern and accessible style that resonates well with Spanish-speaking audiences, especially in Latin America. The term 'novio' (betrothed) is appropriate for contemporary Spanish usage, but some reviews suggest that using 'esposo' (husband) may be more fitting in light of the cultural and legal implications of betrothal during biblical times. The phrase 'como era un hombre recto' (as he was a righteous man) successfully reflects Joseph's character and maintains a conservative perspective. However, minor adjustments could enhance clarity and biblical fidelity. For instance, replacing 'romper el compromiso' (to break the engagement) with 'divorciarse' (to divorce) could convey the seriousness of the situation better. The expression 'no manchar el buen nombre de la joven' (to not tarnish the young woman's good name) is respectful but may benefit from further clarification to ensure its theological implications are fully understood. Overall, the translation is solid, with room for improvements in terminology and clarity to align it more closely with conservative values.

**Translation**:  
> »Vino Juan el Bautista, que no toma vino ni come mucho, y ustedes dicen que está endemoniado. (John the Baptist came, neither drinking wine nor eating much, and you say he has a demon.)  

**Combined Review**:
The translation of MAT 11:18 is generally well executed, capturing the essence of the original text effectively for modern Spanish speakers. While the use of accessible language aligns with the goal of making the Bible more approachable, some phrases warrant reconsideration for clarity and precision. Specifically, the phrase "que no toma vino ni come mucho" could be improved to "que no come ni bebe" or another rendering that conveys the notion of abstinence more clearly without implying moderation. Additionally, altering "está endemoniado" to "tiene un demonio" might resonate more strongly within a conservative Christian context, enhancing both clarity and theological fidelity. Overall, the translation is solid but would benefit from minor adjustments to refine its accuracy and maintain the text's reverence.

> καὶ ἐξίσταντο πάντες οἱ ὄχλοι καὶ ἔλεγον· μήτι οὗτός ἐστιν ὁ Χριστὸς ὁ υἱὸς Δαυΐδ; (And all the crowds were amazed and said, "Is this not the Christ, the Son of David?")

**Translation**:
> La gente estaba maravillada. «¡Quizás Jesús es el Hijo de David!» —exclamaban. (The people were amazed. "Maybe Jesus is the Son of David!" they exclaimed.)

**Combined Review**:
_(Overall Grade: 85.0)_
The translation of MAT 12:23 effectively conveys the amazement and speculation of the crowd about Jesus's identity as the Son of David, utilizing contemporary Spanish that is accessible to modern audiences. Phrases like "La gente estaba maravillada" (The people were amazed) accurately reflect the crowd's astonishment, maintaining the original context. However, the term "quizás" (maybe) may introduce uncertainty about Jesus' identity, which could mislead readers regarding their recognition of Him as the Messiah. Many reviewers suggest using a stronger phrase such as "¡Seguramente este es el Hijo de David!" (Surely this is the Son of David!) to enhance clarity and affirm Jesus' divinity. Overall, while the translation meets the objective of being accessible and modern, adjustments for theological accuracy would strengthen its alignment with conservative Christian perspectives.

**Translation**:
> Y terminaron enojándose con él. Entonces Jesús les dijo. (And they ended up getting angry with him. Then Jesus said to them.)
> ―Al profeta nunca lo aceptan en su propia tierra ni entre su propia gente. (A prophet is never accepted in his own country nor among his own people.)

**Combined Review**:
The translation of MAT 13:57 is generally accurate and captures the essence of the original text well, earning an overall grade of 85. The phrase 'Al profeta nunca lo aceptan en su propia tierra ni entre su propia gente' (A prophet is never accepted in his own country nor among his own people) communicates the meaning effectively and maintains the cultural context of Jesus' statement. However, several reviews suggest improvements in the wording and nuance of certain phrases.

Specifically, the use of 'enojándose' (angering) is noted as potentially informal and could be replaced with 'escanadalizándose' (being offended) to better reflect the original Greek's implication of scandal or offense. Additionally, some reviewers mentioned that the attribution 'Entonces Jesús les dijo.' (Then Jesus said to them.) could be inferred from context and might be streamlined for clarity.

Despite these suggestions, the translation is commended for being modern and accessible to contemporary Spanish-speaking audiences, particularly in Latin America, thus aligning with the translation objective.

**Translation**:
> ―A los extranjeros, claro —respondió Pedro. ("To the foreigners, of course," replied Peter.)

**Combined Review**:
The translation of MAT 17:26 captures the essence of the original Greek text effectively while maintaining a modern and accessible style suitable for Latin American audiences. While it generally meets the objectives of clarity and engagement, there are suggestions for improvement. Reviewers noted that the current translation, while clear, could benefit from additional context regarding the implications of Jesus' message about exemption from the temple tax, specifically the phrase ‘Then the sons are free’ which highlights the freedom believers have in relation to the law. Enhancements could include minor adjustments to enrich theological depth and ensure the significance of the dialogue resonates more strongly with conservative Christian beliefs. The translation's informal tone is appropriate for the target audience, aligning well with the aim of making biblical texts relatable and engaging.

**MAT 18:24**: _(Grade 86.7)_

**Source**:
> ἀρξαμένου δὲ αὐτοῦ συναίρειν προσηνέχθη αὐτῷ εἷς ὀφειλέτης μυρίων ταλάντων. (When he began to settle accounts, one who owed him ten thousand talents was brought to him.)

**Translation**:
> En el proceso, le trajeron a uno que le debía cien millones de pesos. (In the process, one was brought to him who owed him one hundred million pesos.)

**Combined Review**:
The translation of MAT 18:24 as "En el proceso, le trajeron a uno que le debía cien millones de pesos" (In the process, one was brought to him who owed him one hundred million pesos) is generally well executed and accessible for Spanish-speaking audiences, especially in Latin America. While the term "cien millones de pesos" (one hundred million pesos) effectively conveys a sense of the vast debt, it does not fully reflect the original Greek text's "ten thousand talents" (myriads of talents), which carries significant theological implications about debt and forgiveness. Although the modern monetary expression is relatable, it may detract from the verse's depth and the historical context of the biblical narrative. Reviewers noted that the phrase "En el proceso" (In the process) could be simplified for clarity. Additionally, there is a suggestion to include a footnote to clarify the hyperbolic nature of the original debt, helping to bridge the cultural gap. Overall, the translation is engaging and suitable for its purpose but would benefit from minor adjustments to enhance both accuracy and understanding of the biblical context.

(While saying to them: Go into the village opposite you, and immediately you will find a tied donkey and a colt with her; untie them and bring them to me.)

**Translation**:  
> A la entrada del pueblo les dijo:

(At the entrance of the village, he said to them: 'You will find a donkey tied, and a colt with her. Untie them and bring them to me.')

**Combined Review**:
The translation of MAT 21:2 effectively conveys the essence of the original Greek text while remaining accessible to modern Spanish speakers. Phrases like 'burra atada' (tied donkey) and 'junto a ella un burrito' (a colt with her) are appropriate and relatable. However, the instruction 'Desátenlos y me los traen' (Untie them and bring them to me) could be revised to 'Desátenlos y tráiganmelos' (Untie them and bring them to me) for grammatical accuracy and clarity. Additionally, simplifying 'a la entrada del pueblo les dijo' (At the entrance of the village, he said to them) could improve accessibility. Overall, the translation is solid and aligns well with conservative Christian values, maintaining fidelity to the text while striving for engagement.

(Translation: "And they said to Him, 'Do you hear what these are saying?' And Jesus said to them, 'Yes; have you never read, 'Out of the mouth of infants and nursing babies you have prepared praise'?" )

**Translation**:
> —¿No oyes lo que están diciendo esos niños?  
> —Sí —respondió Jesús—.  
> ¿No dicen acaso las Escrituras que “aun los recién nacidos lo adoran”?  
(Translation: "—Do you not hear what these children are saying? —Yes —Jesus replied—. Do the Scriptures not say that 'even the newborns praise Him'?" )

**Combined Review**:
The translation of MAT 21:16 is generally well done and engages modern Spanish speakers effectively. While it conveys the essence of the original text, the phrase 'aun los recién nacidos lo adoran' presents a slight deviation from the intended meaning of the original Greek, which emphasizes 'praise' rather than 'adoration'. Reviews suggest that a more precise wording such as "de la boca de los niños y de los que maman, has establecido alabanzas" would better reflect the biblical intent of the scripture, specifically aligning with Psalm 8:2. Minor adjustments in phrasing could enhance clarity and theological accuracy, ensuring that the translation adheres closely to the original message of Jesus affirming the children's praise. Overall, while the translation is accessible and suitable for its audience, improvements in specificity and accuracy would be beneficial.

**MAT 21:35**: _(Grade 86.7)_

**Source**:  
> καὶ λαβόντες οἱ γεωργοὶ τοὺς δούλους αὐτοῦ ὃν μὲν ἔδειραν, ὃν δὲ ἀπέκτειναν, ὃν δὲ ἐλιθοβόλησαν. (And taking the servants of his, the farmers beat one, killed another, and stoned another.)  

**Translation**:  
> Pero los labradores los atacaron: a uno lo golpearon, a otro lo mataron y a otro lo apedrearon. (But the laborers attacked them: one they beat, another they killed, and another they stoned.)

**Combined Review**:
The translation of MAT 21:35 is generally accurate and maintains the original meaning of the Greek text. It is rendered in a modern and accessible style suitable for Spanish speakers in Latin America, which fulfills the objective of making the Bible engaging. The phrase "los labradores los atacaron" effectively communicates the aggressive actions of the laborers. However, it may be beneficial to consider alternatives like "maltrataron" or "agredieron" to convey a more serious tone. Some reviewers noted that "atacaron" could evoke connotations of excessive violence, which might not align with the intended seriousness of the biblical context. Overall, the translation successfully conveys the essential message and aligns with conservative Christian values, but slight adjustments in terminology could enhance both fidelity and clarity. Minor improvements regarding the translation's fluency and directness could further align it with the intended biblical gravity.

> ἐπιδείξατέ μοι τὸ νόμισμα τοῦ κήνσου. οἱ δὲ προσήνεγκαν αὐτῷ δηνάριον.  

**Translation**:  
> Jesús, que sabía lo que se traían entre manos (what they were scheming), les dijo:  
> ―¡Hipócritas! (Hypocrites!) ¿A quién se creen que están tratando de engañar con preguntas como esas? Enséñenme una moneda (Show me a coin).  
> Y ellos le mostraron una moneda romana de plata (a Roman silver coin).  

**Combined Review**:
The translation of Matthew 22:18-19 is generally effective, capturing the essence of the original Greek text and making it accessible to modern Spanish-speaking audiences. The use of contemporary language serves its purpose of clarity, especially with phrases like 'mostraron una moneda romana de plata' (they showed him a Roman silver coin) which provides cultural context. However, the term '¡Hipócritas!' (Hypocrites!) has raised concerns regarding its strength, potentially detracting from a more reverent tone expected in biblical translations. Suggestions include moderating the tone to invite reflection rather than confrontation. Phrasing such as 'lo que se traían entre manos' (what they were scheming) might be considered too colloquial, thus adjustments are recommended for a broader conservative audience to enhance both reverence and engagement. Overall, the translation is commendable but would benefit from minor tweaks for clarity and formality.

**Translation**:
> y al hacerlo dicen: “¡Nosotros no los habríamos matado!”. (And in doing so they say: "We would not have killed them!")

**Combined Review**:
The translation of MAT 23:30 effectively conveys the original meaning in a clear and modern style suitable for Spanish speakers. The phrase "¡Nosotros no los habríamos matado!" (We would not have killed them!) successfully reflects the denial of complicity that the Pharisees exhibit. However, the translation could be enhanced by incorporating a more formal tone or emphasizing the gravity of Jesus' rebuke to better capture the hypocrisy of the Pharisees. While the current phrasing is relatable and engaging for contemporary audiences, slight adjustments to reflect the original text's emotional depth could improve its impact. Overall, it is a solid translation that fulfills the objectives of accessibility and alignment with conservative interpretations.

> μελλήσετε δὲ ἀκούειν πολέμους καὶ ἀκοὰς πολέμων· ὁρᾶτε μὴ θροεῖσθε· δεῖ γὰρ πάντα γενέσθαι, ἀλλ᾽ οὔπω ἐστὶ τὸ τέλος.  
> ("And you will hear of wars and rumors of wars; see that you are not alarmed; for this must take place, but the end is not yet.")  

**Translation**:  
> Cuando oigan rumores de guerras, no crean que ya estarán señalando mi retorno; habrá rumores y habrá guerra, pero todavía no será el fin.  

**Combined Review**:
The translation of MAT 24:6 captures the essence of the original Greek text while maintaining clarity in modern Spanish. It effectively communicates the warning against misinterpreting signs of the end times. However, the phrase "no crean que ya estarán señalando mi retorno" could imply a certainty not present in the original Greek. A more precise wording could clarify that the wars mentioned are merely rumors and not indications of Christ's return, aligning better with traditional eschatological interpretations. Additionally, correcting "él fin" to "el fin" is necessary for grammatical accuracy. Overall, while the translation is engaging and accessible, minor adjustments are recommended for improved clarity and alignment with conservative Christian perspectives.

**Translation**:
> el Señor llegará cuando menos lo esperen (the Lord will arrive when they least expect it),

**Combined Review**:
The translation of MAT 24:50 as "el Señor llegará cuando menos lo esperen" (the Lord will arrive when they least expect it) accurately captures the essence of the original Greek text, communicating the unexpected nature of the Lord's coming effectively. Reviewers noted that while the current translation is accessible and modern for Spanish speakers, there is a consensus that slight adjustments could enhance the urgency and seriousness conveyed in the original scripture. Suggestions include phrases such as "llegará en un momento inesperado" (will arrive at an unexpected moment) or "el Señor vendrá en el momento menos esperado" (the Lord will come at the least expected moment) to reflect both the urgency and the gravity of the message. Overall, the translation meets the objective well but could be improved by incorporating these nuances to deepen theological precision and resonance with the intended audience.

**MAT 25:14**: _(Grade 86.7)_

**Source**:
> Ὥσπερ γὰρ ἄνθρωπος ἀποδημῶν ἐκάλεσε τοὺς ἰδίους δούλους καὶ παρέδωκεν αὐτοῖς τὰ ὑπάρχοντα αὐτοῦ,  
> (For just as a man going on a journey called his own servants and entrusted to them his possessions)

**Translation**:
> »Hubo una vez un hombre que juntó a sus siervos; antes de partir hacia otro país, y les prestó dinero para que lo invirtieran en su nombre durante su ausencia.  
> (Once there was a man who gathered his servants; before departing for another country, he lent them money to invest in his name during his absence)

**Combined Review**:
The translation of MAT 25:14 generally captures the essence of the original Greek text while maintaining clarity for Spanish-speaking audiences. However, several key areas need refinement for improved fidelity to the original.

The phrase 'juntó a sus siervos' (gathered his servants) could be more accurately translated as 'llamó a sus siervos' (called his servants) to reflect the Greek 'ἐκάλεσε' (called) better. Additionally, the term 'prestó dinero' (lent money) might lead to misinterpretation, as it implies a loan rather than the intended stewardship conveyed by the original Greek 'παρέδωκεν' (entrusted), which would be better rendered as 'entregó' (delivered) or 'confió' (entrusted). The wording 'hacia otro país' (to another country) could also be simplified for clarity. Overall, while the translation is accessible and relatable, these minor adjustments would enhance accuracy and preserve the solemnity of the original text.

> (And coming, the one who received the five talents brought another five talents, saying: Master, you delivered to me five talents; see, I have gained five more talents on them.)  

**Translation**:  
> »El que había recibido los cincuenta mil pesos le entregó cien mil.  
> (The one who had received fifty thousand pesos handed over one hundred thousand.)  

**Combined Review**:
The translation of MAT 25:20 is generally effective in conveying the core message of the original biblical text while using modern and accessible Spanish for the Latin American audience. Most reviewers agree that while the use of 'cincuenta mil pesos' (fifty thousand pesos) is relatable, it would be more accurate to retain the original term 'talents' to preserve the cultural and theological significance inherent in the parable. The phrase 'le entregó cien mil' (he handed over one hundred thousand) is noted to oversimplify the original text, which explicitly refers to the concept of doubling the talents. Additionally, it would be beneficial to emphasize the servant's accountability to the master. Although the translation meets the objectives of engagement and comprehension, minor adjustments are recommended for greater fidelity to the original scripture, such as using more biblically appropriate terminology and slightly expanding phrases to capture the full nuance of the text. Overall, it reflects a solid effort with room for improvement.

**Translation**:
> Pero si lo hiciera, ¿cómo se cumplirían las Escrituras que describen lo que ahora mismo está aconteciendo? (But if I did, how would the Scriptures be fulfilled that describe what is currently happening?)

**Combined Review**:
The translation of MAT 26:54 captures the essential meaning of the original Greek text while using modern and accessible Spanish, making it suitable for a contemporary audience. However, several reviews suggested improvements for clarity.  

1. The phrase "lo hiciera" could be refined to "si yo hiciera eso" for clearer reference to Jesus.  
2. The expression "describen lo que ahora mismo está aconteciendo" could be simplified; options such as "dicen" or "hablan de" might enhance the flow, while shortening to something like "lo que está sucediendo" could also be effective.  

Overall, the translation effectively conveys the theological significance of the verse while maintaining an engaging style for Latin American readers. Minor adjustments are recommended to enhance clarity and fluidity, aligning well with conservative Christian beliefs about the importance of Scripture.

**Translation**:
> A alguien se le ocurrió ponerle una corona de espinas y una vara en la mano derecha a manera de cetro. Burlones, se arrodillaban ante él. (Someone thought to put a crown of thorns on him and a rod in his right hand like a scepter. They mocked him, kneeling before him.)  
> —¡Viva el Rey de los judíos! —gritaban. ("Long live the King of the Jews!" they shouted.)

**Combined Review**:
_(Overall Grade: 86)_: The translation of MAT 27:29 generally conveys the intended message with clarity and accessibility for contemporary Spanish-speaking audiences. However, the phrase "A alguien se le ocurrió" could unintentionally trivialize the soldiers' deliberate actions; a more precise translation like "Le pusieron" would better reflect the intent and seriousness of the moment. Additionally, while the term "burlones" effectively indicates mockery, it might be more impactful to state that they "se arrodillaron burlándose de Él" (kneeled mocking Him) to emphasize their derision. The expression "a manera de cetro" (like a scepter) also warrants reconsideration to fully capture the mockery inherent in the original text. Overall, while the translation is effective and maintains theological significance, a few adjustments would enhance its precision and reverence towards the source material.

**Translation**:
> ―Bueno, ahí tienen un pelotón de soldados. (Well, there you have a squad of soldiers.) Vayan y asegúrense de que nada anormal suceda. (Go and ensure that nothing unusual happens.)

**Combined Review**:
The translation of MAT 27:65 is generally accurate and achieves clarity for modern Spanish speakers. However, several reviewers noted that the phrase 'un pelotón de soldados' (a squad of soldiers) is somewhat informal for a sacred text. Alternatives such as 'una guardia de soldados' (a guard of soldiers) or 'ustedes tienen una guardia de soldados' (you have a guard of soldiers) may better maintain the solemnity of Pilate's command. Additionally, the phrase 'asegúrense de que nada anormal suceda' (ensure that nothing unusual happens) could be refined to something like 'asegúrense de que no ocurra nada' (ensure that nothing occurs) to avoid ambiguity and enhance reverence. Overall, while the translation is clear and accessible, slight adjustments for tone and formality are recommended to better align with the original text and the intent of conveying its gravity.

(But while he thought about these things, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream, saying, "Joseph, son of David, do not be afraid to take to you Mary your wife, for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Spirit.")  

**Translation**:
> Mientras pensaba en esto se quedó dormido y un ángel se le apareció en sueños y le dijo:  
> «José, hijo de David, no temas casarte con María, porque el hijo que lleva en las entrañas lo concibió ella del Espíritu Santo.  

**Combined Review**:
The translation of MAT 1:20 is mostly accurate, clearly conveying the meaning of the original Greek text for Spanish speakers. There are several minor grammatical issues that could enhance clarity and engagement.  

- The phrase "se quedó dormido" can be simplified to "durmió" to better reflect Joseph's intentional act of pondering, while maintaining the flow.  
- The phrase "el hijo que lleva en las entrañas" would be more naturally phrased as "el hijo que lleva en su vientre," aligning with both contemporary usage and traditional biblical language.  
- The phrase "lo concibió ella del Espíritu Santo" can be refined to "fue concebido por el Espíritu Santo" to enhance clarity about the divine nature of Jesus' conception, which is significant from a theological standpoint.  

Overall, the translation is a strong effort, effectively communicating the message while remaining accessible to a modern audience. With some minor adjustments for clarity and resonance, it could further align with conservative Christian values and traditions.

**Translation**:
> De la misma manera que uno puede identificar un árbol por los frutos que lleva, así podrán identificar a esos falsos profetas por la forma en que se comportan. ¿Quién confunde una vid con un espino o una higuera con abrojos? (In the same way that one can identify a tree by its fruits, so you will be able to identify those false prophets by how they behave. Who confuses a vine with a thorn or a fig tree with thistles?)

**Combined Review**:
The translation of MAT 7:16 is generally effective in conveying the original meaning while maintaining accessibility for Spanish-speaking audiences. The core message regarding identifying false prophets by their behavior is clear and engaging. However, the phrase "¿Quién confunde una vid con un espino o una higuera con abrojos?" (Who confuses a vine with a thorn or a fig tree with thistles?) is seen as somewhat awkward and may detract from the clarity and directness of the message. It might be beneficial to simplify or rephrase this portion to align better with the rest of the translation's straightforward style. While the translation successfully preserves the theological essence and is modern, minor refinements to enhance clarity and reduce potential misunderstandings would be advantageous. Overall, it successfully engages a contemporary audience while remaining faithful to the original text.

(*"No one puts a patch of unshrunk cloth on an old garment; for the patch pulls away from the garment, and a worse tear results."*)

(*"No one would think of mending an old dress with a new piece of cloth, because it is likely that the new cloth will shrink and tear the old, making the tear worse."*)

**Combined Review**:
_(Overall Grade: 86.5)_:  
The translation of Matthew 9:16 effectively captures the essence of the original Greek text and makes the metaphor about not patching old garments with new cloth clear and accessible for Spanish speakers, particularly in Latin America. While the modern and conversational Spanish is appropriate for a contemporary audience, some reviews suggested minor adjustments for clarity and fluidity. Phrases like 'lo más probable es que la tela nueva se encoja' (*"it is likely that the new cloth will shrink"*) could be simplified to enhance understanding. Furthermore, emphasizing the spiritual implications of the metaphor may resonate more deeply with a conservative Christian audience, reinforcing the teaching's theological significance. Overall, the translation maintains fidelity to the original message while also being relatable, but there is room for improvement in terms of depth and accessibility.

**Translation**:  
> Cuando alguien le avisó a Jesús que su familia estaba fuera y quería hablarle (When someone informed Jesus that his family was outside and wanted to speak to him),  

**Combined Review**:
The translation of MAT 12:47 effectively conveys the meaning of the original Greek text, using modern and accessible Spanish suitable for Latin American audiences. It communicates the action of someone informing Jesus about his family wanting to speak with him, and the phrasing is generally clear and relatable. However, there are minor issues with fluidity and nuance, such as the urgency of the message and the contrast between spiritual and biological relationships, which could be more directly addressed. Although it maintains fidelity to the scripture and aligns with conservative Christian perspectives, slight improvements in structure and phrasing could enhance its overall readability and formality. Overall, the translation meets its objective well but has room for refinement.

**Combined Review**:
The translation of MAT 13:3-4 has generally been recognized for its clarity and engagement with contemporary Spanish-speaking audiences. While the use of 'simbolismos' (symbols) effectively communicates a modern feel, several reviewers suggested replacing it with 'parábolas' (parables) or 'similitudes' (similarities) to better align with biblical terminology and enhance clarity. Maintaining the original structure and directness of the source text is crucial; phrases like 'el sembrador salió a sembrar' (the sower went out to sow) should be more prominently featured to reflect the direct language of the Greek. While the translation succeeds in making the text accessible and relatable, there remains a consistent call for minor adjustments that would improve theological precision and fidelity to the original meaning. Overall, the translation is well-done but has room for refinement in terminology and alignment with traditional interpretations.

**Translation**:
> sintieron deseos de apresarlo, pero no se atrevieron porque el pueblo tenía a Jesús por profeta. (They felt a desire to seize him, but they did not dare because the people regarded Jesus as a prophet.)

**Combined Review**:
The translation of MAT 21:46 effectively conveys the original meaning while making the text accessible to contemporary Spanish speakers. However, several reviews noted that the phrase "sintieron deseos de apresarlo" could be interpreted as informal and vague, suggesting alternatives like "querían arrestarlo" (they wanted to arrest him) or "deseaban" (they desired) for clarity and seriousness. The overall message and urgency of the leaders' fear of the people and their view of Jesus as a prophet is well preserved.

**Combined Review**:
The translation of MAT 22:12 is commendable, successfully conveying the original message in a clear and engaging modern style suitable for Spanish speakers. The choice of "Amigo mío" (my friend) is appropriate as it reflects warmth and familiarity, enhancing personal engagement. While the phrase “¿cómo entraste sin el vestido de boda?” (how did you enter without the wedding garment?) effectively communicates the gravity of the king's question, there is a suggestion to consider a more formal rendering of the term “vestido de boda” (wedding garment) to preserve the original's significance and symbolism.

> El que esté en la azotea, que no baje a hacer las maletas, (He who is on the roof, let him not go down to take his belongings,)  

**Combined Review**:
The translation of MAT 24:17 as "El que esté en la azotea, que no baje a hacer las maletas" (He who is on the roof, let him not go down to take his belongings) effectively conveys the urgency and immediacy of Jesus' message, using modern and familiar language that resonates with contemporary Spanish speakers. Most reviews agree that while the phrase captures the essence of the original Greek text, the expression "hacer las maletas" (to pack the bags) might dilute the sense of urgency implied in the scripture. Suggestions for improvement include more direct phrases such as "no baje a buscar nada de su casa" (do not go down to look for anything from his house) or "no baje a recoger cosas" (do not go down to pick up things) which could enhance clarity and better reflect the gravity of the instruction.

(Translation: But the bridegroom answered them, 'I do not know who you are! Go away!')  

**Combined Review**:
_(Average Grade: 86.3)_:  
The translation of MAT 25:12 effectively conveys the essence of the original Greek text, communicating the bridegroom's message of rejection clearly in modern Spanish. The phrase '¡No sé quiénes son ustedes! ¡Váyanse!' captures the urgency and directness of the original context. However, the tone may benefit from being softened to reflect the love and grace characteristic of Christ's teachings. Alternative phrases like '¡Aléjense!' (Translation: 'Stay away!') or '¡Retírense!' (Translation: 'Withdraw!') could present a gentler admonition while still maintaining the seriousness of the message. Additionally, using a more literal translation such as 'No los conozco' (Translation: 'I do not know you') for 'I do not know you' could enhance the translation's authority.

**Combined Review**:
The translation of MAT 27:19 is generally effective, clearly conveying the original meaning while employing modern and accessible language for Spanish-speaking audiences, particularly in Latin America. The phrase 'horrible pesadilla' appropriately reflects the seriousness of the dream experienced by Pilate's wife and aligns with a conservative view of the significance of prophetic warnings. While the overall clarity and impact of the translation are commendable, some reviewers suggested adjustments to enhance formality and precision in specific phrases. For instance, using 'justo' (righteous) instead of just referring to 'ese hombre' (that man) may help emphasize Jesus' character more strongly.

> Quisiéramos que ordenaras poner guardias ante la tumba hasta el tercer día, para evitar que sus discípulos vayan, se roben el cuerpo y luego se pongan a decir que resucitó. Si eso sucede estaremos peor que antes.  
(We would like you to order guards to be placed at the tomb until the third day, to prevent his disciples from coming and stealing the body and then saying that he has risen. If that happens, we will be worse off than before.)  

**Combined Review**:
The translation of MAT 27:64 effectively communicates the urgency and intent of the original text. It uses contemporary language that is accessible to modern Spanish speakers in Latin America, which is commendable. While the overall clarity and engagement of the translation are strong, there are suggestions for minor improvements. The phrase "se roben el cuerpo" could be made more formal by using "sustraer" to reflect the gravity of the situation better. Similarly, rephrasing "si eso sucede estaremos peor que antes" would enhance clarity and seriousness. Additionally, directness in phrases such as "quisiéramos que ordenaras" could improve clarity by changing it to "queremos que ordenes." Overall, the translation is well-done, retaining the message's integrity while remaining relatable for its audience.

**MAT 5:30**: _(Grade 87.0)_

**Source**:
> καὶ εἰ ἡ δεξιά σου χεὶρ σκανδαλίζει σε, ἔκκοψον αὐτὴν καὶ βάλε ἀπὸ σοῦ· συμφέρει γάρ σοι ἵνα ἀπόληται ἓν τῶν μελῶν σου καὶ μὴ ὅλον τὸ σῶμά σου βληθῇ εἰς γέενναν.  
(And if your right hand causes you to stumble, cut it off and throw it away; for it is better for you that one of your members perish, than for your whole body to be cast into hell.)  

**Translation**:
> Y si tu mano derecha te conduce al pecado, córtatela y échala lejos. Es mejor quedarse manco que ir al infierno.  
(And if your right hand causes you to stumble, cut it off and throw it away; for it is better for you that one of your members perish, than for your whole body to be cast into hell.)  

**Combined Review**:
The translation of MAT 5:30 is generally clear and captures the urgency of Jesus's message regarding sin. It uses modern language that makes it accessible to contemporary Spanish speakers. However, the phrases 'córtatela y échala lejos' may come across as too casual and might not fully encapsulate the seriousness of the warning. While this translation aligns well with the objectives of accessibility and engagement, some reviewers suggest that terms like 'déjala' instead of 'échala lejos' could enhance the reverence and seriousness of the text. Overall, the translation is effective in conveying the core message, yet slight adjustments could improve its alignment with traditional conservative perspectives on the gravity of sin.

**MAT 13:22**: _(Grade 87.0)_  

**Source**:  
> ὁ δὲ εἰς τὰς ἀκάνθας σπαρείς, οὗτός ἐστιν ὁ τὸν λόγον ἀκούων, καὶ ἡ μέριμνα τοῦ αἰῶνος τούτου καὶ ἡ ἀπάτη τοῦ πλούτου συμπνίγει τὸν λόγον, καὶ ἄκαρπος γίνεται.  
(But he who was sown among thorns, this is he who hears the word, and the cares of this world and the deceitfulness of riches choke the word, and he becomes unfruitful.)  

**Translation**:  
> El terreno lleno de espinos es el corazón del que escucha el mensaje, pero se afana tanto en esta vida que el amor al dinero ahoga en él la Palabra de Dios, y cada vez trabaja menos para el Señor.  
( The ground full of thorns is the heart of one who listens to the message, but is so worried about this life that the love of money chokes the Word of God in him, and he works less for the Lord each time.)  

**Combined Review**:
The translation of MAT 13:22 successfully captures the core message of the original text, warning against worldly distractions and the deceitfulness of wealth. However, several reviewers noted that the phrase "cada vez trabaja menos para el Señor" could be interpreted as overly casual and detracts from the seriousness of the message. Suggestions included using alternatives like "y se vuelve estéril" (and becomes unfruitful) to align more closely with a conservative Christian perspective and to better reflect the original Greek context. While the overall translation is clear and accessible for Latin American Spanish speakers, adjustments to improve formality and fidelity to the original text are recommended.

**MAT 26:70**: _(Grade 87.0)_  

**Source**:  
> ὁ δὲ ἠρνήσατο ἔμπροσθεν αὐτῶν πάντων λέγων· οὐκ οἶδα τί λέγεις. (But he denied it before them all, saying, I do not know what you are talking about.)  

**Translation**:  
> ―No sé de qué estás hablando —le respondió Pedro enojado. (I do not know what you are talking about, Peter replied angrily.)  

**Combined Review**:
The translation of MAT 26:70 is generally effective, capturing the essence of Peter's denial while using modern Spanish that resonates with Latin American audiences. The phrase "No sé de qué estás hablando" accurately conveys Peter's denial, aligning well with the original Greek. However, the use of "enojado" (angrily) introduces an emotional tone that is not explicitly present in the original text. A more neutral expression could enhance the translation by avoiding the implication of anger, maintaining a straightforward and objective portrayal of Peter's response. While the translation is clear and accessible, minor adjustments in emotional language could improve its fidelity to the original context. Overall, the translation meets the accessibility goals well.

**MAT 3:6**: _(Grade 87.2)_

**Source**:
> καὶ ἐβαπτίζοντο ἐν τῷ Ἰορδάνῃ ὑπ᾽ αὐτοῦ ἐξομολογούμενοι τὰς ἁμαρτίας αὐτῶν. (And they were baptized in the Jordan by him, confessing their sins.)

**Translation**:
> A los que reconocían que eran pecadores, él los bautizaba en el río Jordán. (To those who recognized they were sinners, he baptized them in the Jordan River.)

**Combined Review**:
The translation of MAT 3:6 effectively captures the essence of the original Greek text and maintains clarity for modern Spanish speakers. While it is generally strong, several reviewers suggest enhancing the translation's alignment with the original intent of confession. Specifically, replacing 'reconocían que eran pecadores' (recognized they were sinners) with 'confesando sus pecados' (confessing their sins) would more accurately reflect the active acknowledgment of sins as indicated in the Greek. Additionally, explicitly mentioning 'él' (he/John) at the start of the sentence would provide clarity on who is performing the baptism. Overall, the translation is engaging and accessible but would benefit from slight adjustments to better convey the significance of confession and repentance, which are central themes in conservative Christian theology.

**Translation**:
> El Espíritu Santo condujo a Jesús al desierto para que el diablo lo tentara. (The Holy Spirit led Jesus into the wilderness to be tempted by the devil.)

**Combined Review**:
The translation of Matthew 4:1 is generally clear and effectively captures the essence of the original Greek text. It accurately conveys that the Holy Spirit led Jesus into the wilderness for the purpose of being tempted by the devil, aligning well with conservative Christian interpretations. The modern Spanish used is accessible and familiar to Latin American audiences, fulfilling the objective of engaging the readers. However, there are suggestions for improvement: using "llevó" (led) instead of "condujo" (led) might reflect the nuance of direction and purpose more closely; and opting for "tentaciones" (temptations) instead of "tentara" (tempt) could enhance clarity and resonance with the concept of temptation. Additionally, ensuring reverent language that respects the sacred characters may strengthen the overall tone. Overall, the translation is strong, but minor adjustments could enhance precision and adherence to the original intent.

**Translation**:  
> »Los ojos son la lámpara del cuerpo. Si tu ojo es bondadoso, andarás en la luz; (The eyes are the lamp of the body. If your eye is good, you will walk in the light;)  

**Combined Review**:
The translation of Matthew 6:22 is generally accurate and conveys the original meaning effectively, particularly in its modern presentation for Spanish-speaking audiences. However, there are suggestions for improving clarity and theological depth. The phrase "Si tu ojo es bondadoso, andarás en la luz" (If your eye is good, you will walk in the light) can be enhanced; using "vivirás en la luz" (you will live in the light) or considering "ojo sano" (healthy eye) instead of "bondadoso" (good) might resonate more clearly with audiences, emphasizing the spiritual implications of clarity and generosity. While the translation captures the essence of the scripture well, these adjustments could deepen understanding and connection with the text. Overall, it successfully fulfills the goals of accessibility and engagement.

(Translation: Or how will you say to your brother, "Let me take the speck out of your eye," when there is a log in your own eye?)  

**Translation**:  
> ¿Cómo le pedirás a tu amigo que te deje sacarle la paja que tiene en su ojo, si la viga que tienes en el tuyo no te deja ver?  
(Translation: How will you ask your friend to let you take the speck out of his eye, when the beam in your eye prevents you from seeing?)  

**Combined Review**:
The translation of MAT 7:4 is effective in conveying the metaphor and core message of self-examination before judging others. It utilizes modern and accessible language, making it relatable for Spanish speakers in Latin America. However, several reviews noted that the choice of 'amigo' (friend) could be revised to 'hermano' (brother) to reflect the original Greek term 'ἀδελφῷ' (brother), which emphasizes community and familial relationships. Additionally, while the metaphor is clear, phrases like 'la viga que tienes en el tuyo no te deja ver' (the beam in your eye prevents you from seeing) could benefit from further refinement for greater clarity and resonance with a conservative audience. Overall, the translation is strong but would improve with these minor adjustments for clarity and cultural relevance.

**MAT 9:3**: _(Grade 87.2)_

**Source**:
> καὶ ἰδού τινες τῶν γραμματέων εἶπον ἐν ἑαυτοῖς· οὗτος βλασφημεῖ. (And behold, some of the scribes said within themselves, 'This man blasphemes.')

**Translation**:
> «¡Blasfemia!» —pensaron algunos de los maestros religiosos que lo oyeron. ("Blasphemy!" —thought some of the religious leaders who heard him.)

**Combined Review**:
The translation of MAT 9:3 effectively captures the essence of the original text, clearly communicating the accusation of blasphemy by the scribes. The phrase "¡Blasfemia!" is appropriate, reflecting the severity of their thoughts and aligning well with the intent to engage Spanish-speaking audiences. However, several reviewers noted that the phrase "maestros religiosos" (religious leaders) could be made more colloquial by using "líderes religiosos" (religious leaders) for greater familiarity. Additionally, the translations lack a certain formality and reverence expected in a biblical context, which could be enhanced by adjusting wording to convey the gravity of the situation more effectively. Overall, while the translation is solid and accessible, incorporating a more traditional tone could enhance its impact for a conservative Christian audience. Suggestions include a direct phrasing like "algunos de los escribas pensaron en su corazón" (some of the scribes thought in their hearts) to maintain the seriousness of the scriptural context.

**MAT 10:18**: _(Grade 87.2)_

**Source**:
> καὶ ἐπὶ ἡγεμόνας δὲ καὶ βασιλεῖς ἀχθήσεσθε ἕνεκεν ἐμοῦ εἰς μαρτύριον αὐτοῖς καὶ τοῖς ἔθνεσιν. (And you will be brought before governors and kings for my sake, as a testimony to them and to the Gentiles.)

**Translation**:
> Y hasta tendrán que comparecer ante gobernadores y reyes por mi causa. Esto les brindará la oportunidad de hablarles de mí y de proclamarme ante el mundo. (And you will have to appear before governors and kings for my sake. This will give them the opportunity to speak of me and to proclaim me before the world.)

**Combined Review**:
The translation of MAT 10:18 is generally well-executed, with clarity and accessibility for Spanish speakers in mind. While it effectively conveys the original message and maintains the biblical context, some phrases, such as "Esto les brindará la oportunidad de hablarles de mí y de proclamarme ante el mundo" (This will give them the opportunity to speak of me and to proclaim me before the world) could be perceived as softening the gravity of the message regarding bearing witness. A more straightforward rendering, such as using "esto será un testimonio para" (this will be a testimony for) or "serán testigos ante ellos y ante los gentiles" (they will be witnesses before them and before the Gentiles), may align more closely with the original Greek text's intent. Overall, while the translation resonates well with contemporary audiences, slight adjustments would enhance theological precision and maintain the seriousness of the original scripture.

**MAT 13:47**: _(Grade 87.2)_

**Source**:
> Πάλιν ὁμοία ἐστὶν ἡ βασιλεία τῶν οὐρανῶν σαγήνῃ βληθείσῃ εἰς τὴν θάλασσαν καὶ ἐκ παντὸς γένους συναγαγούσῃ· (Again, the Kingdom of Heaven is like a net thrown into the sea that gathers fish of every kind.)

**Translation**:
> »El reino de los cielos es como el pescador que tira la red al agua y recoge peces de todo tipo, buenos y malos. (The Kingdom of Heaven is like a fisherman who throws a net into the water and gathers fish of all kinds, both good and bad.)

**Combined Review**:
The translation of MAT 13:47 is generally clear and effectively conveys the core message of the original text in a modern and accessible style for Latin American Spanish speakers. While the metaphor of the 'pescador' (fisherman) is appropriate, it could be beneficial to clarify that this represents Jesus or a figure from the Kingdom of Heaven to deepen understanding. The phrase 'peces de todo tipo, buenos y malos' (fish of all kinds, good and bad) could also be refined to emphasize the distinction between the righteous and the wicked more explicitly, which would enhance clarity. Overall, the translation fulfills its purpose well but leaves room for minor improvements in wording and contextual depth.

(Why do your disciples transgress the tradition of the elders? For they do not wash their hands when they eat bread.)  

**Translation**:  
> ―¿Por qué tus discípulos desobedecen la tradición antigua? —dijeron—. ¡No están observando el ritual de lavarse las manos antes de comer!  
(Why do your disciples disobey the ancient tradition? —they said—. They are not observing the ritual of washing their hands before eating!)  

**Combined Review**:
The translation of MAT 15:2 is generally clear and captures the essence of the original Greek text, effectively conveying the challenge presented by the Pharisees. While the phrase 'desobedecen la tradición antigua' (disobey the ancient tradition) successfully communicates disobedience to established customs, it may be improved by using 'tradición de los ancianos' (tradition of the elders) to reflect the original more faithfully. The phrase 'ritual de lavarse las manos' (ritual of washing their hands) might imply a formality that could detract from the original intent, and using simpler terms could enhance clarity further. Overall, the translation aligns well with conservative Christian values, maintaining engagement and understanding for the Latin American audience.

**Translation**:  
> ―No creo que sea correcto quitarle el pan a los hijos y echárselo a los perros  (I do not think it is right to take the bread from the children and throw it to the dogs)  
> —le replicó Jesús.  (Jesus replied to him.)  

**Combined Review**:
The translation of MAT 15:26 effectively captures the essence of Jesus' response, maintaining the clarity and theological significance of the original text while presenting it in modern, accessible Spanish for Latin American audiences. The phrase "No creo que sea correcto" (I do not think it is right) may benefit from a slight adjustment to a more definitive expression like "No es correcto..." (It is not right...) to enhance the authority of Jesus’ words. Additionally, the colloquial nature of "quitarle el pan a los hijos y echárselo a los perros" (to take the bread from the children and throw it to the dogs) could be perceived as somewhat harsh; thus, considering a less colloquial term might broaden acceptance. Furthermore, softening the term "perros" (dogs) to something less derogatory could improve sensitivity. Overall, the translation successfully communicates the intended message, fulfilling the objective of accessibility, though minor adjustments are recommended for optimal clarity and reverence.

> Al llegar al otro lado del lago, los discípulos se dieron cuenta de que se les había olvidado la comida. En aquel preciso instante Jesús les decía:  
(When they arrived at the other side of the lake, the disciples realized that they had forgotten to bring food. At that precise moment, Jesus was saying to them:)  

**Combined Review**:
The translation of MAT 16:5 is generally clear and captures the essence of the original Greek text. It effectively conveys the situation of the disciples forgetting to bring bread, maintaining a modern and relatable tone suitable for Latin American Spanish speakers. Phrases like 'se les había olvidado la comida' resonate well with the audience, although some reviewers suggested alternatives like 'los discípulos olvidaron llevar pan' to align more closely with traditional translations and emphasize the literal aspect of forgetting bread. While the translation is accessible and engaging, there are recommendations for minor improvements regarding flow and phrasing, such as simplifying sections for better clarity and reverence for the biblical context. Overall, the translation meets its objectives but could benefit from slight adjustments to enhance fidelity to the source material and maintain the intended message.

**Translation**: Un día, estando aún en Galilea, les dijo: «Alguien me va a traicionar y me va a entregar a los que quieren matarme (One day, while still in Galilee, he told them: 'Someone is going to betray me and hand me over to those who want to kill me').

**Combined Review**:
The translation of MAT 17:22 is effective and generally well-executed, capturing the essence of the original Greek text in a modern, accessible style appropriate for Latin American audiences. However, there are suggestions for improvement to enhance clarity and fidelity to the original message. Specifically, using 'el Hijo del Hombre' (the Son of Man) instead of 'alguien' (someone) may provide more specificity and maintain the emphasis on Jesus’ identity. Additionally, some reviewers noted that the phrase 'los que quieren matarme' (those who want to kill me) could be interpreted as a broader hostility rather than a direct reference to the religious leaders. Overall, while the translation is engaging and relatable, slight adjustments would strengthen its theological accuracy and gravitas for a conservative audience.

**Translation**:  
> Entonces los discípulos le dijeron:  
> ―Si eso es así, ¡mejor sería no casarse!  
(Translation: Then the disciples said to him: "If this is the case, it would be better not to marry!")  

**Combined Review**:
The translation of MAT 19:10 effectively captures the meaning of the original Greek text while remaining accessible to modern Spanish speakers. The phrase "¡mejor sería no casarse!" conveys the disciples' serious and somewhat shocked response to Jesus' teachings on marriage and divorce, though it could be seen as slightly informal for some conservative audiences. While the modern phrasing aids comprehension, incorporating a tone that reflects the gravity of the disciples' concern could enhance the translation. Overall, the translation is commendable for its clarity and relatability, but slight adjustments may be warranted to align more closely with traditional views on the seriousness of marriage within a conservative Christian context.

**Translation**:  
> ―Es Jesús, el profeta de Nazaret de Galilea. (It is Jesus, the prophet from Nazareth of Galilee.)  

**Combined Review**:
The translation of Matthew 21:11, "―Es Jesús, el profeta de Nazaret de Galilea," effectively communicates the identity of Jesus and is accessible for Spanish speakers in Latin America. While the translation maintains clarity and a modern style, reviewers noted that it could enhance the portrayal of Jesus' significance beyond simply being called a prophet. Emphasizing His role as the Messiah or Son of God would better align with conservative Christian theology. The reviews acknowledged that while the translation meets its objective of being engaging and understandable, there is room for improvement in capturing the theological depth and importance of Jesus' identity in a way that resonates with the audience.

**Combined Review**:
The translation of MAT 21:15 effectively conveys the original meaning of the Greek text while using modern Spanish that is accessible to Latin American audiences. Phrases like 'los principales sacerdotes' (the chief priests) and 'se llenaron de indignación' (they were filled with indignation) accurately reflect the gravity of the situation and the emotional response of the religious leaders. However, phrases such as 'los demás jefes judíos' (the other Jewish leaders) may benefit from specification to 'los escribas' (the scribes) for clarity. Additionally, while 'sorprendentes milagros' (surprising miracles) captures the miracles, a more explicit description could enhance understanding. Suggestions for simplifying 'se perturbaron y se llenaron de indignación' (they were disturbed and filled with indignation) and using 'milagros asombrosos' (amazing miracles) may further enhance clarity and engagement without losing meaning. Overall, the translation aligns well with conservative Christian values and fulfills the objective of accessibility, though minor adjustments are recommended to improve its clarity and fidelity to the original message.

**Translation**:  
> Después de esto regresó a Betania, donde pasó la noche. (After this, he returned to Bethany, where he spent the night.)  

**Combined Review**:
The translation of MAT 21:17 effectively conveys the original Greek meaning in a clear and accessible manner for Latin American Spanish speakers. However, the phrase "donde pasó la noche" (where he spent the night) could be perceived as casual, lacking the formality appropriate for the context. Alternatives such as "donde se alojó" (where he lodged) or a phrase that emphasizes the significance of Jesus’ actions could enhance the reverence and richness of the text.

**Translation**:  
> Y el hijo le respondió: “Lo siento; no tengo deseos de trabajar hoy en la finca”. Pero luego, arrepentido, fue.  
(And the son answered, "I'm sorry; I don't want to work today in the vineyard." But afterward, repented, he went.)

**Combined Review**:
Summary:  
The translation of MAT 21:29 captures the essence of the original Greek text while maintaining accessibility for modern Spanish speakers. Although it effectively conveys the son's reluctance and the theme of repentance, the phrase "Lo siento; no tengo deseos de trabajar hoy en la finca" could be improved for a closer reflection of the original text's tone. Many reviewers suggested using a more direct phrase, such as "No quiero," to better represent the son's blunt refusal. Additionally, the term "finca" could be replaced with "viña" to align more closely with the biblical context. Overall, the translation is strong, clear, and relatable but would benefit from minor adjustments to enhance fidelity to the original message.

**Translation**:
> De ahora en adelante tu casa quedará abandonada, (From now on your house will be left abandoned,)

**Combined Review**:
The translation of Matthew 23:38 as "De ahora en adelante tu casa quedará abandonada" is overall clear and maintains the essential meaning of the original Greek text. It effectively communicates the gravity of the message regarding abandonment, making it accessible to modern Spanish speakers, particularly in Latin America. However, there are suggestions for improvement. The use of "tu casa" may convey an overly personal tone, given that the context relates to a collective judgment on Jerusalem. Therefore, it might be beneficial to consider using "su casa" or "la casa de ustedes" to reflect this communal aspect. Furthermore, while the word "abandonada" is understandable, alternatives like "desolada" or "desierta" could better emphasize the severity of Jesus' warning, aligning more closely with the theological implications. In summary, this translation is solid and engaging, but slight adjustments could enhance its clarity and emotional weight.

**Translation**:
> Mientras salían, sus discípulos le suplicaron que los acompañara a recorrer los edificios del templo.  
> (As they went out, his disciples came to him, pleading that he accompany them to view the buildings of the temple.)

**Combined Review**:
The translation of MAT 24:1 is generally strong and effectively conveys the original meaning of the Greek text. The phrase "sus discípulos le suplicaron que los acompañara a recorrer los edificios del templo" is well-constructed and accessible for contemporary Spanish speakers, especially in Latin America. However, there are several points for improvement. The term 'recorrer' (to walk through) could be replaced with 'mostrar' (to show) for better fidelity to the original text's intent. Furthermore, while 'le suplicaron' (they pleaded) reflects the urgency of the disciples' request, 'preguntaron' (they asked) might simplify the language without diminishing the seriousness of the passage. Overall, refining these phrases would enhance clarity and preserve the theological weight of the scripture.

**Combined Review**:
The translation of MAT 24:30 effectively communicates the prophetic significance of Christ's return while remaining modern and accessible to Spanish speakers. Phrases like "la señal de mi venida" (the sign of my coming) and the depiction of the world's reaction convey the essence of the original text well. However, the expression "el mundo entero se ahogará en llanto" (the whole world will drown in weeping) may imply despair rather than the intended awe and reverence. It would be beneficial to revise it to something like "todas las naciones de la tierra lamentarán" (all the nations of the earth will lament) for better alignment with traditional interpretations. Additionally, phrases such as "ver al Hijo del Hombre venir" (see the Son of Man coming) could replace "al verme llegar" (when I come) to maintain theological accuracy. Overall, while the translation is clear and modern, slight adjustments are recommended for greater fidelity to the original language and conservative Christian perspectives.

**Combined Review**:
The translation of MAT 24:49 successfully captures the essence of the original Greek text while maintaining a modern and accessible style for Spanish speakers. The phrase "se dedican a oprimir a sus consiervos" reflects the abusive behavior of the unfaithful servant, although some reviews suggest that a more direct translation of 'τύπτειν' as 'golpear' (to beat) could convey the severity of the master's actions more accurately. The expressions "a andar de fiestas y a emborracharse" are recognized as modern and relatable, effectively communicating the warnings against neglecting duties and indulging irresponsibly, which aligns with conservative Christian views on accountability. However, minor improvements are suggested to enhance fidelity to the original text and to ensure clarity, as the term 'oprimir' may not fully capture the nuance of mistreatment intended in the original. Overall, while the translation serves its purpose of being engaging for Latin American audiences, attention to the original structure and nuance could further enhance its effectiveness.

**Source**:
> τοῦτο γάρ ἐστι τὸ αἷμά μου τὸ τῆς καινῆς διαθήκης τὸ περὶ πολλῶν ἐκχυνόμενον εἰς ἄφεσιν ἁμαρτιῶν. (For this is my blood of the new covenant, which is shed for many for the forgiveness of sins.)

**Translation**:
> porque esto es mi sangre que sella el nuevo pacto. Mi sangre se derramará para perdonar con ella los pecados de infinidad de personas. (for this is my blood that seals the new covenant. My blood will be shed to forgive the sins of countless people.)

**Combined Review**:
The translation of MAT 26:28 effectively captures the essence of the original Greek text while aiming for accessibility for Spanish speakers. The phrase "mi sangre que sella el nuevo pacto" (my blood that seals the new covenant) is a strong and theologically significant interpretation, but using "nuevo pacto" (new covenant) can more explicitly reference the New Covenant. The expression "se derramará para perdonar con ella los pecados de infinidad de personas" (will be shed to forgive the sins of countless people) is engaging yet may benefit from slight revisions for clarity, such as replacing "infinitud" (infinity) with "innumerables" (innumerable) or "muchas" (many) to better align with traditional interpretations. Overall, while the modern style is appropriate for the audience, refining these phrases can enhance both theological accuracy and clarity, maintaining the solemnity of the message. A commendable effort with minor adjustments needed.

**Source**:
> καὶ ἐπέθηκαν ἐπάνω τῆς κεφαλῆς αὐτοῦ τὴν αἰτίαν αὐτοῦ γεγραμμένην· οὗτός ἐστιν Ἰησοῦς ὁ βασιλεὺς τῶν Ἰουδαίων. (And they put over His head the accusation against Him written: This is Jesus the King of the Jews.)

**Translation**:
> En la cruz, por encima de la cabeza de Jesús, habían puesto un letrero que decía: «este es jesús, el rey de los judíos» (On the cross, above Jesus' head, they had put a sign that said: "this is Jesus, the king of the Jews").

**Combined Review**:
The translation of MAT 27:37 effectively communicates the essential message of the original text while adopting a modern style appropriate for Latin American Spanish speakers. However, there are several areas for improvement. Primarily, the name 'Jesús' should be capitalized to reflect the proper reverence and respect in line with traditional biblical conventions. Additionally, the quotation format used in the translation does not adhere to standard Spanish punctuation; it would be more suitable to use «» for the quoted phrase. While the overall meaning and context are preserved and the translation is clear, enhancing the formality and reverent tone would better align it with conservative Christian values. Overall, this is a strong translation with minor grammatical and stylistic adjustments needed to achieve a higher level of respectfulness.

**MAT 27:39**: _(Grade 87.2)_  

**Source**:  
> Οἱ δὲ παραπορευόμενοι ἐβλασφήμουν αὐτὸν κινοῦντες τὰς κεφαλὰς αὐτῶν (And those who passed by blasphemed him, shaking their heads)  

**Translation**:  
> La gente que pasaba por allí se burlaba de él y meneando la cabeza decía: (The people passing by mocked him, shaking their heads and saying:)  

**Combined Review**:
The translation of MAT 27:39 is generally effective in capturing the mocking tone and ridicule faced by Jesus as depicted in the original Greek text. It employs modern and accessible Spanish, making it suitable for contemporary readers in Latin America. While phrases like "se burlaba de él" (mocked him) and "meneando la cabeza" (shaking their heads) successfully convey the crowd's derision, several reviewers noted that enhancing the expressiveness of the translation could further emphasize the contempt directed at Jesus. Suggestions include using alternative words like "moviendo" (moving) or "agitando" (waving) to reflect the scorn more vividly, as well as incorporating more direct dialogue to align closer with the original intent. Overall, the translation maintains clarity and seriousness appropriate for the context of the crucifixion, but minor adjustments could improve its engagement and fidelity to the original text.

**MAT 7:9**: _(Grade 87.3)_

**Source**:
> ἢ τίς ἐστιν ἐξ ὑμῶν ἄνθρωπος, ὃν ἐὰν αἰτήσῃ ὁ υἱὸς αὐτοῦ ἄρτον, μὴ λίθον ἐπιδώσει αὐτῷ; (Or what man is there among you, who, if his son asks for bread, will give him a stone?)

**Translation**:
> ¿Si su hijo le pide pan, ¿quién de ustedes será capaz de darle una piedra? (If his son asks for bread, who of you will be able to give him a stone?)

**Combined Review**:
The translation of MAT 7:9 is commendable, effectively conveying the essence of the original Greek text while maintaining clarity for a modern Spanish-speaking audience. While it aligns with the objective of accessibility and engagement, there are suggestions to improve phrasing. The phrase '¿quién de ustedes será capaz de darle una piedra?' could be reworded to '¿quién de ustedes le dará una piedra?' (who of you will give him a stone?) to enhance clarity and readability. This adjustment retains the rhetorical impact and reflects the original text's simplicity, aligning well with the conservative Christian perspective that emphasizes God’s goodness and loving nature. Overall, with these minor adjustments, the translation achieves its goal of being both faithful and accessible.

**MAT 7:13**: _(Grade 87.3)_

**Source**:
> Εἰσέλθετε διὰ τῆς στενῆς πύλης· ὅτι πλατεῖα ἡ πύλη καὶ εὐρύχωρος ἡ ὁδὸς ἡ ἀπάγουσα εἰς τὴν ἀπώλειαν, καὶ πολλοί εἰσιν οἱ εἰσερχόμενοι δι᾽ αὐτῆς. (Enter through the narrow gate; for wide is the gate and broad is the way that leads to destruction, and many are those who enter through it.)

**Translation**:
> »Entren por la puerta estrecha, porque ancha es la puerta y espacioso el camino que conducen a la perdición; por eso muchísimas personas los prefieren. ("Enter through the narrow gate, for wide is the gate and broad is the way that leads to destruction; therefore, many people prefer it.")

**Combined Review**:
The translation of MAT 7:13 captures the essence of the original Greek text while presenting it in a clear, modern, and accessible Spanish suitable for Latin American audiences. Phrases like "puerta estrecha" (narrow gate) and "camino espacioso" (broad path) effectively communicate the contrast between the narrow way leading to life and the broad way leading to destruction. However, the phrase "por eso muchísimas personas los prefieren" (therefore many people prefer it) has been noted as slightly misleading; it implies preference rather than emphasizing the stark warning inherent in the text. Suggestions for improvement include rephrasing this part to clarify the reality of many choosing the broad path, with alternatives like "y son muchos los que eligen entrar por ella" (and many are those who choose to enter it) or similar constructions to reflect the original message accurately. Overall, the translation is strong, with a commendable effort and minor adjustments needed for clarity and fidelity to the scripture's warning.

**Source**:  
> ὁ δὲ ἀποκριθεὶς εἶπεν αὐτοῖς· ὀψίας γενομένης λέγετε· εὐδία· πυρράζει γὰρ ὁ οὐρανός;  

**Translation**:  
> ―De veras me sorprende ("Truly, I am surprised")  
> —les respondió Jesús ("Jesus responded to them")—.  
> Ustedes pueden leer en el cielo las predicciones del tiempo. ("You can read the predictions of the weather in the sky.") Si el cielo se pone rojo hoy por la tarde saben que habrá buen tiempo mañana; ("If the sky turns red this evening, you know that there will be good weather tomorrow;")  

**Combined Review**:
The translation of MAT 16:2 captures the essence of the original Greek text while employing modern and accessible Spanish. While the use of colloquial expressions makes it relatable to Latin American readers, the phrase 'de veras me sorprende' may not fully convey the authoritative tone of Jesus' response. A more formal alternative, such as 'En verdad les digo' ("Truly I say to you"), could enhance the translation's fidelity to the original scripture's tone. Overall, the translation effectively communicates the intended message, maintaining clarity and readability, although it could benefit from minor adjustments for greater precision and respectfulness. The combination of engaging language and the translation's intent aligns well with the objective of making the text accessible while preserving its core meaning.  

**Overall Grade**: 88.

**MAT 25:18**: _(Grade 87.3)_

**Source**:
> ὁ δὲ τὸ ἓν λαβὼν ἀπελθὼν ὤρυξεν ἐν τῇ γῇ καὶ ἀπέκρυψε τὸ ἀργύριον τοῦ κυρίου αὐτοῦ. (But the one who received the one talent went away and dug in the ground and hid his master's money.)

**Translation**:
> Pero el que recibió los diez mil, cavó en la tierra y escondió el dinero para que estuviera seguro. (But the one who received the ten thousand dug in the ground and hid the money to keep it safe.)

**Combined Review**:
The translation of MAT 25:18 is generally well-executed and conveys the essence of the original Greek text effectively. The phrase "cavó en la tierra y escondió el dinero para que estuviera seguro" (dug in the ground and hid the money to keep it safe) successfully communicates the action taken by the servant. However, there is a consensus that the phrase "para que estuviera seguro" (to keep it safe) may inadvertently suggest a positive motivation for the servant's actions, rather than the implied fear and lack of initiative present in the original text. Suggestions for refinement include rephrasing to emphasize the servant's reluctance or fear, such as using alternatives like "para asegurarlo" (to secure it) or "para protegerlo" (to protect it). Overall, while the translation is clear and accessible for contemporary Spanish speakers, minor adjustments could enhance its fidelity to the original intent, reinforcing the moral lessons of responsibility and stewardship within a conservative Christian framework.

**MAT 27:1**: _(Grade 87.3)_

**Source**:
> Πρωΐας δὲ γενομένης συμβούλιον ἔλαβον πάντες οἱ ἀρχιερεῖς καὶ οἱ πρεσβύτεροι τοῦ λαοῦ κατὰ τοῦ Ἰησοῦ ὥστε θανατῶσαι αὐτόν·  
(But when morning had come, all the chief priests and elders of the people took counsel against Jesus to put him to death.)

**Translation**:
> Al amanecer, los principales sacerdotes y funcionarios judíos se reunieron a deliberar sobre la mejor manera de lograr que el gobierno romano condenara a muerte a Jesús.  
(At dawn, the chief priests and Jewish officials gathered to deliberate on the best way to get the Roman government to condemn Jesus to death.)

**Combined Review**:
The translation of MAT 27:1 is generally clear and accurate, effectively conveying the original text's meaning in a modern and accessible Spanish style suitable for Latin American readers. It captures the seriousness of the context where religious leaders plot against Jesus. 

However, several reviews suggest improvements. The phrase "los principales sacerdotes y funcionarios judíos" could be more precisely translated as "los principales sacerdotes y los ancianos del pueblo" to align with the original Greek terms 'ἀρχιερεῖς' (chief priests) and 'πρεσβύτεροι' (elders). This adjustment would help preserve the text's original intent and authority. 

Additionally, the phrase "a deliberar sobre la mejor manera de lograr que el gobierno romano condenara a muerte a Jesús" could benefit from simplification and greater directness, emphasizing the council's actions rather than their methods. This is crucial as it reflects the gravity of the situation and aligns with the conservative Christian perspective, which emphasizes the themes of betrayal and injustice present in the passage. 

Overall, while the translation is commendable and accessible, slight adjustments could enhance its precision and impact, making it resonate more effectively with a conservative audience.

**Translation**:
> «Tierra de Zabulón y Neftalí, que estás en el camino al mar, al otro lado del Jordán, Galilea, donde tantos extranjeros habitan: (Land of Zebulun and Naphtali, which is on the road to the sea, across from the Jordan, Galilee, where so many foreigners dwell)

**Combined Review**:
The translation of MAT 4:15 is generally accurate and successfully conveys the essence of the original Greek text while maintaining accessibility for modern Spanish speakers. The phrase "Tierra de Zabulón y Neftalí" is effective in communicating geographical context, although some reviewers noted that it might benefit from a more direct connection to the original phrasing, such as incorporating the term 'Gentiles' or 'nations' directly. The expression "que estás en el camino al mar" could be simplified to enhance clarity, potentially revised to "que se encuentra en el camino hacia el mar" (which is on the road to the sea). Overall, while the translation captures essential meanings and is engaging for Latin American audiences, a few adjustments regarding phrasing and fidelity to the original text could further improve its accuracy and alignment with conservative Christian interpretations.

**MAT 6:27**: _(Grade 87.5)_  

**Source**:  
> τίς δὲ ἐξ ὑμῶν μεριμνῶν δύναται προσθεῖναι ἐπὶ τὴν ἡλικίαν αὐτοῦ πῆχυν ἕνα; (Who among you by worrying can add a single hour to your life?)  

**Translation**:  
> Además, ¿qué gana uno con preocuparse?; ¿podemos acaso alargar nuestra vida aunque sea una hora? (Besides, what does one gain by worrying?; can we even extend our life by an hour?)  

**Combined Review**:
The translation of MAT 6:27 effectively captures the essence of the original Greek text while remaining accessible to modern Spanish speakers. The phrase "¿qué gana uno con preocuparse?" (what does one gain by worrying?) communicates the futility of worry well, though it may come off as somewhat casual for the gravity of the message. Many reviewers suggest that a more formal phrasing could better convey the seriousness of the scripture. The second part of the translation, "¿podemos acaso alargar nuestra vida aunque sea una hora?" (can we even extend our life by an hour?) also faces criticism for its informality and could be improved by adopting a more direct wording like "¿quién de ustedes puede añadir una hora a su vida mediante la preocupación?" (who among you can add an hour to your life by worrying?) to resonate more with conservative interpretations. Despite these observations, the translation remains a strong effort that aligns well with its objective of accessibility while still reflecting theological accuracy. Overall, minor adjustments could enhance the translation's clarity and alignment with traditional views.

(**Translation**: "Do not give what is holy to the dogs, nor cast your pearls before swine, lest they trample them under their feet, and turn and tear you in pieces.")  

**Translation**:  
> »No le den lo que es santo a los perros, ni echen perlas delante de los puercos; porque son capaces de pisotearlas y luego dar media vuelta y atacarlos a ustedes.  

**Combined Review**:
The translation of Matthew 7:6 is generally clear and modern, making it accessible for Spanish speakers in Latin America. The essence of the original Greek text is effectively captured, conveying the warning against sharing sacred things with those who do not value them. However, the use of "echen" could be revised to "arrojen" for greater formality and precision, and terms like "perlas" and "puercos" might be softened to maintain a sense of reverence. Additionally, the phrase "dar media vuelta y atacarlos a ustedes" could benefit from more formal language in a biblical context. Overall, the translation successfully maintains the message of Jesus while striving for clarity and engagement. It is a strong effort, meriting an overall score reflecting its strengths and areas for improvement.

**MAT 7:10**: _(Grade 87.5)_  

**Source**:  
> καὶ ἐὰν ἰχθὺν αἰτήσῃ, μὴ ὄφιν ἐπιδώσει αὐτῷ; (And if he asks for a fish, will he give him a serpent?)  

**Translation**:  
> Y si le pide pescado, seguro que no le dará una serpiente venenosa, ¿verdad? (And if he asks for fish, surely he will not give him a poisonous serpent, right?)  

**Combined Review**:
The translation of MAT 7:10 generally conveys the original meaning effectively and is accessible to modern Spanish speakers, particularly in Latin America. The familiar language enhances relatability and engagement. However, there is a consensus that the phrase 'serpiente venenosa' may not fully capture the intended message, as 'ὄφις' (ofin - snake) in the original text has broader connotations of danger rather than specifically poisonous. A recommendation is made to simplify it to just 'una serpiente' (a serpent) to align with traditional interpretations and reflect the generality present in many translations. Additionally, adjusting the informal tone of '¿verdad?' (right?) to a more neutral phrasing may better fit the biblical context. Overall, while the translation successfully meets its objectives, minor refinements could enhance both accuracy and the reflection of the conservative Christian perspective.

> (And rising, Jesus followed him, and his disciples.)  

**Translation**:  
> Jesús y los discípulos se dirigieron al hogar del jefe judío.  
> (Jesus and the disciples headed to the home of the Jewish leader.)  

**Combined Review**:
The translation of MAT 9:19 is clear and maintains the essential meaning of the original Greek text while being accessible to modern Spanish speakers in Latin America. The phrase 'Jesús y los discípulos se dirigieron al hogar del jefe judío' effectively conveys the action of moving towards the specified location. However, there are suggestions for improvement, including incorporating more detail about Jesus' immediate action ('He arose') and using a more direct translation of 'followed him' to emphasize the discipleship aspect. Suggested phrasing could include 'Jesús se levantó y siguió al jefe judío junto con sus discípulos' to better reflect the urgency and obedience of the moment. Overall, the translation is suitable, yet slight enhancements could deepen the connection to the original text's nuances and the disciples' relationship with Jesus.

**Translation**:  
> Usé estos simbolismos porque esta gente oye y ve, pero no entiende.  
(I used these symbolisms because this people hears and sees, but does not understand.)  

**Combined Review**:
The translation of MAT 13:13 effectively captures the essence of the original Greek text while maintaining modern and accessible language suitable for Spanish speakers. The phrase "Usé estos simbolismos porque esta gente oye y ve, pero no entiende" reflects the core message of spiritual blindness, aligning well with the original intent of the scripture. While the translation is commendable for its clarity and relatability, there are suggestions for improvement. Specifically, the term "simbolismos" may be better replaced with "parábolas" to align with traditional biblical terminology. Additionally, using "estas personas" or "este pueblo" could offer a more respectful tone compared to "esta gente." Overall, the translation meets the objectives of accessibility and engagement while maintaining theological accuracy, with minor adjustments suggested to enhance clarity and reverence.

**Translation**:  
> “Seguro que alguno de mis enemigos las sembró” ("Surely one of my enemies has sown them"), explicó el labrador ("the laborer explained"). “¿Quieres que arranquemos la mala hierba?” ("Do you want us to pull up the weeds?"), preguntaron los trabajadores ("the workers asked").  

**Combined Review**:
(Average Grade: 87.5):  
The translation of MAT 13:28 is generally accurate and effectively conveys the original Greek meaning. The modern Spanish used is appropriate and accessible for the target audience, particularly for Spanish-speaking communities in Latin America. While the phrase 'Seguro que alguno de mis enemigos las sembró' ("Surely one of my enemies has sown them") is clear, some reviewers suggest a more direct rendering, such as 'un enemigo ha hecho esto' ("an enemy has done this"), to enhance clarity and fidelity to the original text. The dialogue captured between the laborer and his workers maintains the biblical essence and is engaging for the audience. However, there are recommendations to emphasize the spiritual nature of the message, particularly regarding the concept of an enemy. Overall, the translation is well-received but has opportunities for refinement to improve its clarity and alignment with conservative Christian perspectives.

(Translation: "Is this not the carpenter's son? Is not his mother called Mary, and his brothers James and Joseph and Simon and Judas?")  

**Translation**:  
> ―¿Será posible? —comentaban—. Este es hijo de María y del carpintero, y hermano de Jacobo, José, Simón y Judas.  
(Translation: "Is it possible? they were saying. This is the son of Mary and the carpenter, and brother of James, Joseph, Simon, and Judas.")  

**Combined Review**:
The translation of MAT 13:55 effectively captures the meaning of the original Greek text while using modern and accessible Spanish. Phrases like "hijo de María y del carpintero" and the listing of the brothers contribute to clarity. However, the opening phrase "¿Será posible?" could be interpreted as slightly informal for some readers, and a more idiomatic expression could enhance its impact. Additionally, using "hijo del carpintero" instead of "del carpintero" would be closer to the original text. Overall, the translation is well-executed, engaging for Spanish speakers, and maintains a respectful tone appropriate for conservative Christian audiences. Minor adjustments could improve fluidity and fidelity to the biblical context.

(But you say, 'Whoever says to his father or mother, “Whatever you might gain from me is a gift to God,”’ does not honor his father or mother.)

**Translation**:  
> Pero ustedes dicen: “Es preferible dejar de ayudar a los padres que estén en necesidad a dejar de ofrendar a Dios”.  
(But you say: “It is better to not help needy parents than to offer to God.”)

**Combined Review**:
The translation of MAT 15:5 effectively captures the essence of the original Greek text and conveys Jesus' rebuke of the Pharisees for prioritizing human tradition over God's commandments. The modern Spanish makes it accessible to contemporary readers while reflecting the core message. However, the phrase "Es preferible dejar de ayudar a los padres que estén en necesidad a dejar de ofrendar a Dios" could be improved for clarity. Suggestions include using a term that emphasizes the seriousness of honoring parents, such as replacing "preferible" with a phrase that conveys a stronger contrast. Furthermore, adjusting the wording to underscore the moral implications of familial responsibilities might enhance alignment with conservative Christian values. Overall, while the translation is solid and understandable, slight modifications could strengthen its impact.

(But Jesus called his disciples to him and said, "I have compassion for these people; they have already been with me three days and have nothing to eat. I do not want to send them away hungry, or they may collapse on the way.")

**Translation**:
> “Me da lástima toda esta gente”  
> —dijo Jesús en voz baja a sus discípulos—.  
> “Hace tres días que están aquí y ya no tienen nada que comer. No quiero enviarlos a sus casas sin comer, porque se desmayarían en el camino.”  
(“I feel sorry for all these people,” Jesus said quietly to his disciples. “They have been here for three days and have nothing to eat. I do not want to send them home without eating, because they might faint on the way.”)

**Combined Review**:
The translation of MAT 15:32 is generally effective and modern, making the verse accessible and engaging for Spanish speakers in Latin America. The use of informal phrases like "me da lástima" (I feel sorry) resonates well with the audience and emphasizes Jesus' compassion. However, some phrases like "dijo Jesús en voz baja" (Jesus said quietly) may imply a sense of secrecy rather than intended compassion. Furthermore, the phrase "porque se desmayarían en el camino" (because they might faint on the way) could be rephrased for clarity, possibly using "podrían desfallecer en el camino" (they might collapse on the way) to better reflect the urgency. Additionally, the use of casual language could be seen as less reverent in a conservative interpretation of scripture. Overall, the translation captures the essence of Jesus' care for the people while maintaining the emotional tone of the passage, although some minor adjustments could enhance clarity and respect for the original text.

**Translation**:
> Pero Jesús, que sabía lo que estaban pensando, les dijo:  
> ―¡Qué hombres con tan poca fe! ¿Por qué se preocupan tanto por la comida?  
(But Jesus, knowing what they were thinking, said to them: "You of little faith! Why are you so concerned about food?")

**Combined Review**:
The translation of MAT 16:8 generally meets the objectives of accessibility and modernity for Spanish speakers, particularly in Latin America. The phrase '¡Qué hombres con tan poca fe!' (What men of such little faith!) effectively conveys Jesus' reprimand but could be simplified to '¡Hombres de poca fe!' (Men of little faith!) for a more direct approach. While '¿Por qué se preocupan tanto por la comida?' (Why are they so concerned about food?) communicates the context, it may not emphasize the spiritual lesson effectively. A clearer alternative might be '¿Por qué se preocupan por el pan?' (Why are you concerned about bread?), which aligns better with the biblical language. Overall, the translation captures the essence of the message but could benefit from minor adjustments for greater fidelity to the original Greek text.

(As they came into Capernaum, the collectors of the two-drachma tax went up to Peter and said, "Does your teacher not pay the tax?")  

**Translation**:  
> Al llegar a Capernaúm, los cobradores de impuestos del templo le preguntaron a Pedro:  
> ―Tu Maestro, ¿paga impuestos?  

**Combined Review**:
The translation of MAT 17:24 successfully captures the core meaning of the original Greek text while presenting it in a clear and accessible manner for modern Latin American Spanish speakers. The phrase "los cobradores de impuestos del templo" accurately reflects the original context, though it might be simplified to just "cobradores de impuestos" for brevity. The dialogue, particularly "¿paga impuestos?", while conversational, could benefit from a more formal tone to better reflect the seriousness of the question, such as rephrasing it to "¿Acaso su Maestro no paga los impuestos?". Overall, the translation is effective and conveys the intended message well, but there is room for slight improvements in formality and clarity to enhance its reverence and fluidity.

**Translation**:
> »Así hará mi Padre celestial al que se niegue a perdonar a algún hermano».  
(Thus my heavenly Father will also do to the one who refuses to forgive a brother.)

**Combined Review**:
The translation of MAT 18:35 is generally accurate and captures the essence of the original Greek text, effectively conveying the importance of forgiveness in a Christian context. While the phrase "al que se niegue a perdonar a algún hermano" communicates the original meaning well, several reviewers suggested that it could be improved for clarity and flow. Replacing "se niegue a perdonar" with "que no perdone" or a similar phrase might enhance accessibility for modern readers. Additionally, a more explicit reference to the emotional weight of forgiveness and the seriousness of the consequences for refusing to forgive could strengthen the translation further. There was also a suggestion to use inclusive language such as "hermanos y hermanas" to reflect a broader understanding of community. Overall, the translation aligns with the objective of engaging contemporary Spanish speakers and effectively preserves the theological message.

> »Yo les enviaré profetas, hombres llenos del Espíritu y escritores inspirados, pero a algunos los crucificarán, a otros les destrozarán las espaldas a latigazos en las sinagogas, y a los demás los perseguirán de ciudad en ciudad. (I will send you prophets, men filled with the Spirit and inspired writers, but some of them will be crucified, others will be scourged in the synagogues, and the rest will be persecuted from city to city.)

**Combined Review**:
The translation of MAT 23:34 is generally strong, effectively capturing the essence of the original Greek text while making it accessible for contemporary Spanish speakers, particularly in Latin America. However, the phrase "hombres llenos del Espíritu y escritores inspirados" (men filled with the Spirit and inspired writers) may be viewed as a modern interpretation that could diverge from traditional conservative terminology, which typically emphasizes direct references to "profetas" (prophets). The phrase "les destrozarán las espaldas a latigazos" (they will tear their backs to shreds with whips) could also benefit from more formal language to enhance reverence. Suggestions include using simpler terms like "golpearán" (they will strike) or "azotarán" (they will scourge). Overall, while the translation succeeds in clarity and engagement, minor adjustments could improve fidelity to the original message and align better with conservative interpretations.

**Translation**:  
> declararon:

**Combined Review**:
The translation of MAT 26:61 is generally clear, accurate, and effectively captures the essence of the original text. The modern Spanish used makes the verse accessible to Latin American audiences. The phrase, "Este hombre dijo que era capaz de destruir el templo de Dios y reconstruirlo en tres días," successfully conveys the critical accusation against Jesus, which is vital for understanding this passage's context. However, several reviews suggest that the translation could benefit from adjustments to enhance theological depth and reverence, aligning more closely with conservative Christian interpretations. Specifically, the translation might incorporate more formal phrasing to emphasize the significance of Jesus' claims regarding the temple, enhancing both clarity and the overall seriousness of the statement. Overall, while the translation is commendable, slight stylistic and theological refinements are recommended for improved engagement and fidelity to traditional interpretations.

 ("Behold, I send you out as sheep in the midst of wolves; therefore be wise as serpents and harmless as doves.")

**Translation**:
> "Ustedes son como ovejas y los estoy enviando a meterse donde están los lobos. Sean prudentes como serpientes e inofensivos como palomas."  
 ("You are like sheep and I am sending you into the midst of wolves. Be wise as serpents and harmless as doves.")

**Combined Review**:
The translation of MAT 10:16 effectively captures the essence of the original Greek text, presenting a clear and accessible message suitable for Spanish speakers, especially in Latin America. Reviewers appreciate the modern and familiar phrasing, which enhances relatability, particularly the use of 'ustedes' for inclusivity. However, several comments suggest improving the phrase 'a meterse donde están los lobos' ("into the midst of wolves") for a more formal rendering, such as 'en medio de lobos' ("in the midst of wolves"), to better align with the solemnity of the biblical context. Additionally, there is a call for refinement in interpreting 'inofensivos' ("harmless") for 'ἀκέραιοι' ("pure" or "integrity") to convey purity or integrity more accurately. Despite these areas for enhancement, the overall assessment recognizes the translation's accessibility, urgency, and the successful communication of wisdom and innocence, maintaining fidelity to the intended message of the scripture.

(It is enough for the disciple to be like his teacher, and the servant like his lord.) εἰ τὸν οἰκοδεσπότην Βεελζεβοὺλ ἐκάλεσαν, πόσῳ μᾶλλον τοὺς οἰκιακοὺς αὐτοῦ; (If they have called the master of the house Beelzebub, how much more those of his household?)  

**Translation**:
> Es suficiente para el discípulo ser como su maestro y para el siervo como su señor. (It is enough for the disciple to be like his teacher and the servant like his lord.) Y si a mí, que soy como el padre de familia, me llaman Beelzebú, ¿qué no les dirán a ustedes? (And if they have called me, who am like the head of the household, Beelzebub, what will they not say to you?)  

(Translation: "It is enough for the disciple to be like his teacher, and the servant like his lord. If they have called the master of the house Beelzebub, how much more those of his household?")  

**Combined Review**:
The translation of MAT 10:25 effectively communicates the original meaning, using modern and accessible Spanish for Latin American audiences. The phrase "Es suficiente para el discípulo ser como su maestro" accurately captures the essence of the text, reflecting the relationship between disciple and teacher. However, the expression "soy como el padre de familia" might mislead readers regarding Jesus' authority; a more direct reference to His lordship would be beneficial. While the translation is generally clear and relatable, adjustments could enhance clarity, particularly in the final reference to Beelzebub, which should be contextualized to avoid confusion. Suggestions include using "más que" instead of "como" for added clarity. Overall, the translation serves its purpose but has room for improvement in precision and faithfulness to the text.

(Translation: "Later, on that same day, Jesus went out of the house and headed to the shore of the lake.")

**Combined Review**:
The translation of MAT 13:1 generally captures the essence of the original Greek text while making it accessible to modern Spanish speakers. Most reviewers suggest simplifying the phrase 'Mas tarde, aquel mismo día' to 'Ese mismo día' or 'Más tarde, ese mismo día' for clarity and flow. Additionally, 'se dirigió a la orilla del lago' could be modified to 'se fue a la orilla del lago' for a more idiomatic expression.

**Translation**:

**Combined Review**:
The translation of MAT 13:11 is generally clear and captures the essential meaning of the original text. It conveys the idea of exclusivity regarding the understanding of the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, which is a significant aspect from a conservative Christian viewpoint. The modern and accessible language is well-suited for Spanish speakers, especially in Latin America.  
However, the phrase "los únicos a los que se les permitía entender" suggests a stronger exclusivity than intended. Recommendations include considering alternatives like "se les ha revelado" to communicate divine initiative without implying harsh exclusion. Additionally, minor grammatical adjustments are needed, such as changing "era a los únicos" to "eran los únicos" for proper tense agreement. Overall, the translation meets its objectives well, with suggestions for slight refinements in clarity and tone.

(As evening approached, the disciples came to him and said: "This is a remote place, and it’s already getting late. Send the crowds away, so they can go to the villages and buy themselves some food.")  

**Translation**:

**Translation**:
> Entonces Jesús le dijo a la mujer: (Then Jesus said to the woman:)  
> ―Me enviaron a ayudar a las ovejas perdidas de Israel, no a los gentiles. ("I was sent to help the lost sheep of Israel, not to the Gentiles.")

**Combined Review**:
The translation of MAT 15:24 effectively captures the core message of the original Greek text while ensuring accessibility for modern Spanish-speaking audiences. The phrase "Me enviaron a ayudar a las ovejas perdidas de Israel, no a los gentiles" communicates Jesus' mission clearly, but the term "gentiles" may seem formal and potentially exclusionary to contemporary readers. A more familiar or compassionate term could improve relatability and convey a tone of inclusion consistent with the overall message of Christ. While the phrasing is generally modern and appropriate, slight adjustments could enhance clarity and sensitivity without losing the original intent. Overall, the translation demonstrates strong fidelity to the source material with minor improvements recommended.

(so that the crowds marveled, seeing the deaf [hearing, the mute] speaking, the lame healthy, the crippled walking, and the blind seeing; and they glorified the God of Israel.)

**Translation**:
> ¡Qué espectáculo! (What a spectacle!) Los que hasta entonces no podían pronunciar ni una palabra hablaban emocionados; los miembros inútiles de los lisiados eran restaurados; (the useless limbs of the disabled were restored;) los cojos caminaban y saltaban, (the lame walked and leaped,) mientras que los ciegos, maravillados, contemplaban por primera vez el mundo. (while the blind, amazed, beheld the world for the first time.) El gentío, asombrado, alababa al Dios de Israel. (The crowd, amazed, praised the God of Israel.)

**Combined Review**:
The translation of MAT 15:31 effectively conveys the emotional and miraculous elements of the passage, successfully engaging modern Spanish-speaking audiences. The phrases such as '¡Qué espectáculo!' (What a spectacle!) and 'maravillados' (amazed) evoke awe, reflecting the nature of the events. However, some reviewers noted that phrases like 'los miembros inútiles de los lisiados eran restaurados' (the useless limbs of the disabled were restored) might be seen as insensitive and suggested revisions for greater respect and dignity towards those described. Additionally, 'gentío' (crowd) could be interpreted negatively, with 'multitud' (multitude) being a preferable term. There is also concern that expressions may lack reverence from a conservative perspective. Overall, while the translation is vibrant and accessible, adjustments to enhance sensitivity and maintain a respectful tone are recommended to align better with the reverent nature of scripture.

**Combined Review**:
The translation of MAT 16:18 is generally well-received, achieving clarity and accessibility for Spanish speakers, especially in Latin America. Most reviewers agree that the phrase 'Tú eres Pedro, y sobre esta roca edificaré mi iglesia' effectively communicates the original message in a modern context. While the addition of the note clarifying that 'Pedro' means 'piedra' can aid understanding, some feel it detracts from the overall impact and solemnity of the scripture. Reviewers suggest that maintaining fidelity to the original text is crucial, particularly regarding the phrase about 'los poderes del infierno' (**the powers of hell**) which could better reflect the original Greek concept of 'las puertas del infierno' (**the gates of hell**). Overall, the translation balances modern accessibility with theological significance, though minor adjustments could enhance both the depth and fluency of the text.

**Combined Review**:
The translation of MAT 17:27 is commendable and effectively captures the essence of the original Greek text while employing modern, accessible Spanish suitable for Latin American audiences. The use of direct speech and clear phrasing makes the dialogue engaging. However, the phrase "para que no se ofendan" may benefit from a more literal interpretation such as "para no escandalizarlos" ("so as not to scandalize them") to align better with the original intent regarding causing offense. Additionally, refining the phrase "en la boca del primer pez que saques" ("in the mouth of the first fish that you catch") could enhance clarity and emphasize the miraculous nature of the event. While the translation is generally strong and aligns well with conservative Christian values, some minor adjustments in phrasing and word choice could improve its fidelity to the original text.

**Combined Review**:
The translation of MAT 22:8 effectively conveys the original meaning of the Greek text, clearly stating that the wedding banquet is ready but those invited are unworthy. The use of modern Spanish makes it accessible to contemporary readers, especially in Latin America. However, some reviews suggest enhancing the phrasing to reflect a more formal biblical style, such as substituting 'los que estaban invitados' with 'los invitados', or considering alternatives for 'dignos' to enhance emotional resonance.

**Translation**:
> Por eso, vayan ahora por las esquinas e inviten a todo el mundo.  
> (Therefore, go now to the corners and invite everyone.)

**Combined Review**:
The translation of MAT 22:9 successfully captures the essence of the original Greek text and presents it in a modern and engaging manner suitable for Latin American audiences. However, some aspects could be refined to enhance its reverence and accuracy. Specifically, the phrase 'todo el mundo' (everyone) might come across as too casual for the solemnity of the biblical context. Suggested alternatives include 'a todos los que encuentren' (to all whom you find) or 'inviten a todos' (invite all), which preserve the invitation's gravity while maintaining clarity. Additionally, replacing 'por eso' (for that reason) with 'por tanto' (therefore) could better align the language with traditional biblical text.

Porque ellos mismos no hacen lo que dicen que se debe hacer. (Because they themselves do not do what they say should be done.)

**Combined Review**:
The translation of MAT 23:3 is generally effective in conveying the essence of the original text and making it accessible to modern Spanish-speaking audiences. The phrases used, such as "obedezcan" and "hagan lo que dicen," capture the imperative nature of Jesus' instruction while emphasizing the distinction between the teachings and actions of the scribes and Pharisees. However, the colloquial tone of "¡Hagan lo que dicen, pero no se les ocurra hacer lo que ellos hacen!" (Of course, obey them. Do what they say, but do not even think of doing what they do!) may come across as overly informal and less reverential, which might not align fully with conservative interpretations. A more formal phrasing could enhance the respectfulness of the translation, ensuring it reflects the gravity of the message. Overall, while the translation succeeds in engaging a contemporary audience, slight adjustments to tone and formality would better suit a conservative Christian perspective.

> y todos los hombres están en el mismo nivel de hermanos. (and all men are at the same level as brothers.)

**Combined Review**:

Phrases such as "No dejen que nadie los llame así" (Do not let anyone call you this) accurately reflect the directive of Christ and promote humility and equality among believers. While the translation is generally clear, minor adjustments could enhance fluidity, particularly regarding the integration of terms like "Rabí" (Rabbi) and "Maestro" (Teacher).

The translation of Matthew 24:2 effectively conveys the core message of the original Greek text in a modern and accessible style for Spanish-speaking audiences. The phrase "no quedará ni una piedra sobre otra" accurately reflects the urgency of Jesus' proclamation regarding the destruction of the temple.

**Combined Review**:
The translation of MAT 24:44, "ustedes también deben estar vigilantes para que mi regreso no los sorprenda," effectively conveys the urgency and core message of the original Greek text in a modern and accessible manner suitable for Spanish speakers. However, several reviewers noted areas for enhancement, specifically regarding the phrase "mi regreso." It may better reflect the original text to reference "el Hijo del Hombre" **(the Son of Man)** instead. Additionally, suggestions were made to improve the phrasing to enhance clarity and impact, such as using alternatives like "para que no sean sorprendidos por mi regreso" **(so that you are not surprised by my return)** or "para que mi regreso no los tome por sorpresa" **(so that my return does not catch you by surprise)**.

**Translation**:
> Sin pérdida de tiempo, el traidor se acercó a Jesús. (Without wasting time, the traitor approached Jesus.)  
> ―Hola, Maestro —le dijo, y lo besó. ("Hello, Teacher," he said, and kissed him.)

**Combined Review**:
The translation of MAT 26:49 is largely effective in conveying the urgency and intent of the original Greek text. Phrases like 'Sin pérdida de tiempo' (Without wasting time) appropriately reflect Judas's urgency, while 'Hola, Maestro' (Hello, Teacher) attempts to create familiarity. However, some reviewers suggest that using 'Rabí' (Rabbi) instead of 'Maestro' (Teacher) would better capture the reverence of the original term, and alternatives such as 'De inmediato' (Immediately) or 'Enseguida' (Right away) might express urgency more fluently.

**Combined Review**:
The translation of MAT 26:60 is generally effective, successfully conveying the essence of the original Greek text while being accessible for Spanish speakers. Most reviewers agree that the phrase 'falsos testimonios' (false testimonies) could be more explicitly related to false witnesses to emphasize their deceitfulness, and the transition to 'dos individuos' (two individuals) may be improved for better flow.

**Translation**:
> Al llegar la noche, un hombre rico de Arimatea llamado José, discípulo de Jesús, (When evening had come, a rich man from Arimathea named Joseph, a disciple of Jesus)

**Combined Review**:
The translation of MAT 27:57 is generally clear, modern, and accessible for Spanish speakers. The phrase 'Al llegar la noche' (When evening had come) effectively captures the timing. The description of José as 'un hombre rico de Arimatea llamado José, discípulo de Jesús' (a rich man from Arimathea named Joseph, a disciple of Jesus) conveys his status and relationship with Jesus adequately. However, it would be beneficial to enhance the clarity regarding his discipleship, perhaps by rephrasing it to indicate he is a prominent follower or believer in Jesus. A slightly more colloquial phrasing, such as 'cuando ya era de noche' (when it was already night), could also improve engagement. Overall, while the translation successfully conveys the essential meaning, minor adjustments could enhance clarity and flow, better aligning with conservative Christian perspectives.

**Combined Review**:
The translation of MAT 5:44 is generally clear and accessible, capturing the essence of Jesus' teaching about loving one's enemies and praying for persecutors. While the phrase "¡Amen a sus enemigos!" effectively communicates the command, it may cause confusion due to its inaccuracy; a more appropriate rendering would be "¡Amen a vuestros enemigos!" or simply "¡Aman a sus enemigos!" Additionally, there are suggestions to consider alternatives such as "¡Amen a sus adversarios!" to better convey the nuance of 'enemy' in a biblical context. The phrase "¡Oren por quienes los persiguen!" is correctly interpreted and aligns with the seriousness of the message. Although there are minor adjustments suggested regarding verb choice and phrasing, the overall translation is deemed effective and engaging for Spanish speakers, fulfilling the intent of the original text.

> Διὰ τοῦτο λέγω ὑμῖν, μὴ μεριμνᾶτε τῇ ψυχῇ ὑμῶν τί φάγητε καὶ τί πίητε, μηδὲ τῷ σώματι ὑμῶν τί ἐνδύσησθε· οὐχὶ ἡ ψυχὴ πλεῖόν ἐστι τῆς τροφῆς καὶ τὸ σῶμα τοῦ ἐνδύματος; (For this reason I say to you, do not worry about your soul, what you will eat and what you will drink, nor about your body, what you will wear. Is not the soul more than food and the body more than clothing?)  

**Translation**:
> »Por ello les aconsejo que no se preocupen por la comida, la bebida o la ropa. ¡Es mucho más importante tener vida y un cuerpo, que tener qué comer y qué vestir! (Therefore I advise you not to worry about food, drink, or clothing. It is much more important to have life and a body than to have something to eat and wear!)

**Combined Review**:
The translation of MAT 6:25 effectively captures the essence of the original text and is presented in a clear and accessible manner suitable for Spanish speakers in a Latin American context. The phrase "no se preocupen por la comida, la bebida o la ropa" (do not worry about food, drink, or clothing) accurately conveys the original message, emphasizing the importance of spiritual life over material concerns. However, the concluding phrase "¡Es mucho más importante tener vida y un cuerpo, que tener qué comer y qué vestir!" (It is much more important to have life and a body than to have something to eat and wear!) may come off as slightly informal and shifts the focus from the biblical intent, which emphasizes the relationship between spiritual and physical needs. A more direct translation such as "¿No es la vida más que el alimento y el cuerpo más que la vestimenta?" (Is not life more than food and the body more than clothing?) might be preferable to retain the gravity of the original message for a conservative audience. Overall, the translation is strong and adheres to the goal of engaging Spanish speakers while allowing for minor adjustments to enhance theological depth and fidelity to the source material.

**MAT 11:8**: _(Grade 87.8)_

**Source**:
> ἀλλὰ τί ἐξήλθετε ἰδεῖν; ἄνθρωπον ἐν μαλακοῖς ἱματίοις ἠμφιεσμένον; ἰδοὺ οἱ τὰ μαλακὰ φοροῦντες ἐν τοῖς οἴκοις τῶν βασιλέων εἰσίν.  
(But what did you go out to see? A man dressed in soft clothing? Behold, those who wear soft clothing are in kings' houses.)

**Translation**:
> ¿o acaso a un hombre vestido de príncipe? ¡Estos se encuentran en los palacios reales!  
(But did you go out to see a man dressed in fine clothing? Those are found in royal palaces!)

**Combined Review**:
The translation of MAT 11:8 effectively captures the essence and meaning of the original Greek text while utilizing a modern and accessible style for Spanish speakers. However, the phrase "¿o acaso a un hombre vestido de príncipe?" could benefit from a rephrasing to enhance clarity and maintain a respectful tone. A suggestion would be to use "¿o acaso a un hombre vestido con ropas finas?" or "hombre de finos ropajes," as these alternatives would better convey the connotation of luxuriousness and align with traditional Biblical language. While the translation fulfills its objective of being relatable and engaging for contemporary audiences, slight adjustments to specific phrases could improve its fluency and clarity. Overall, it remains accurate and appropriate for the intended purpose.

**Source**:
> Καὶ ἐγένετο ὅτε ἐτέλεσεν ὁ Ἰησοῦς τὰς παραβολὰς ταύτας μετῆρεν ἐκεῖθεν, (And it came to pass, when Jesus had finished these parables, he departed from there)

**Translation**:
> Al terminar de exponer estos simbolismos, Jesús fue (When he finished explaining these symbols, Jesus went)

**Combined Review**:
The translation of MAT 13:53 effectively captures the essence of the original Greek text and presents it in a clear and accessible manner for Latin American audiences. While the phrase 'simbolismos' (symbols) is used, several reviewers suggest that a more accurate term would be 'parábolas' (parables), as this better reflects Jesus' use of parables to convey deeper spiritual truths. Although the translation communicates the overall meaning well, it could be enhanced by including additional context or detail about Jesus' actions following his teaching to improve narrative coherence. Overall, the translation is strong and aligns well with the objective of making scripture engaging and comprehensible for Spanish speakers, but minor adjustments regarding terminology and context could further enhance its clarity and fidelity to the original text.

**MAT 23:13**: _(Grade 87.8)_

**Source**:
> Οὐαὶ δὲ ὑμῖν, γραμματεῖς καὶ Φαρισαῖοι ὑποκριταί, ὅτι κατεσθίετε τὰς οἰκίας τῶν χηρῶν καὶ προφάσει μακρὰ προσευχόμενοι· διὰ τοῦτο λήψεσθε περισσότερον κρῖμα. (Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites, because you devour widows' houses and for a pretense make long prayers; therefore, you will receive greater condemnation.)

**Translation**:
> »¡Ay de ustedes, escribas y fariseos hipócritas, porque ni entran al reino de los cielos ni dejan entrar a nadie! (Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites, for you neither enter the kingdom of heaven nor allow those who are entering to go in!)

**Combined Review**:
The translation of Matthew 23:13 effectively captures the essence of the original Greek text while being accessible for Spanish speakers, particularly in Latin America. The use of phrases like "¡Ay de ustedes!" conveys urgency and emphasizes the hypocrisy of the religious leaders. However, the phrase "ni entran al reino de los cielos ni dejan entrar a nadie" simplifies the condemnation and misses critical context regarding their actions, such as devouring widows' houses. Although the modern and familiar language enhances understanding, slight adjustments to include more nuance and detail from the original text could strengthen the impact of the translation. Overall, this translation is strong, aligns well with a conservative Christian perspective, and meets most expectations for clarity and engagement.

**Translation**:  
> ¿No se dan cuenta de que se están tildando de hijos de asesinos? (Don't you realize that you are calling yourselves children of murderers?)  
**Combined Review**:
The translation of MAT 23:31 is generally well-executed, maintaining clarity and effectively conveying the original Greek's meaning. The phrase "¿No se dan cuenta de que se están tildando de hijos de asesinos?" (Don't you realize that you are calling yourselves children of murderers?) captures the gravity of Jesus's condemnation towards the Pharisees and scribes. However, there are suggestions for enhancing the impact of the phrase 'tildando de hijos,' which may feel somewhat informal. Alternatives like 'considerándose' (considering themselves) or 'llamando' (calling) could reflect the seriousness more directly and strengthen the overall tone of the translation. The style remains modern and accessible for Latin American audiences, successfully aligning with the objective of making the Bible relatable while upholding theological integrity.

**Translation**:  
> Quítenle ese dinero y dénselo al que tiene los cien mil pesos, (Take that money away from him and give it to the one who has the hundred thousand pesos,)  

**Combined Review**:
The translation of MAT 25:28 is generally effective and communicates the core message of the original text. While it is accessible and engaging for contemporary Spanish speakers, concerns have been raised regarding the specificity of 'cien mil pesos' (hundred thousand pesos), which may obscure the broader theological implications of the term 'talento' (talent) used in the source text. The reviews suggest a preference for language that better reflects the traditional biblical context, emphasizing the need for a tone that conveys the seriousness and gravity of the scripture. Overall, while the translation is rated positively for clarity and modern relevance, there is a consensus on the potential for refinement to align more closely with conservative interpretations of the biblical text.

**Translation**:
> Cuando fue adonde había dejado a los tres discípulos, los halló dormidos. (When he went to where he had left the three disciples, he found them asleep.)
> «Pedro (Peter)
> —dijo—, (he said—)
> ¿no pudieron quedarse despiertos conmigo ni siquiera una hora? (could you not stay awake with me even one hour?)

**Combined Review**:
The translation of MAT 26:40 effectively captures the essence of the original Greek text, conveying it in clear and modern Spanish that is accessible to Latin American readers. Reviewers noted that while the translation communicates the disappointment and urgency of Jesus' words well, there are minor areas for improvement. Suggestions include emphasizing the emotional weight of phrases like '¿no pudieron quedarse despiertos conmigo ni siquiera una hora?' (could you not stay awake with me even one hour?) to reflect Jesus' direct address to Peter more strongly, potentially using a phrase like 'no pudisteis' (you could not) instead of 'no pudieron' (they could not). Some reviews also recommended slight restructuring of sentences for better flow and emotional resonance, such as changing 'los halló dormidos' (he found them asleep) to 'los encontró dormidos' (he found them asleep). Overall, the translation is commendable but could benefit from these refinements to enhance clarity and impact.

**MAT 4:4**: _(Grade 88.0)_

**Source**:
> ὁ δὲ ἀποκριθεὶς εἶπε· γέγραπται, οὐκ ἐπ᾽ ἄρτῳ μόνῳ ζήσεται ἄνθρωπος, ἀλλ᾽ ἐπὶ παντὶ ῥήματι ἐκπορευομένῳ διὰ στόματος Θεοῦ. (But he answered and said, "It is written: 'Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceeds from the mouth of God.'")

**Translation**:
> ―¡No! (No!)  
> —le respondió Jesús—. (Jesus answered him)  
> Escrito está: “Para vivir no sólo es importante el pan: debemos obedecer todo lo que manda Dios”. (It is written: "Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceeds from the mouth of God.")

**Combined Review**:
The translation of MAT 4:4 is clear and effectively conveys the essential message of reliance on God's word rather than solely on physical sustenance, aligning well with conservative Christian values. However, several reviewers pointed out that the phrase 'debemos obedecer todo lo que manda Dios' (we must obey everything that God commands) slightly shifts the meaning from a direct quotation to an interpretative statement. It is suggested that a more literal rendering, such as 'sino de toda palabra que sale de la boca de Dios,' (but by every word that proceeds from the mouth of God) would maintain the original emphasis and enhance theological accuracy. While the modern Spanish used makes the text accessible to the audience, adjustments to enhance fidelity to the original scriptural intent would improve the translation's quality.

**Translation**:
> dejaron a su padre a cargo de lo que estaban haciendo y siguieron a Jesús. (They left their father in charge of what they were doing and followed Jesus.)

**Combined Review**:
The translation of MAT 4:22 is generally accurate and clear, effectively conveying the essence of the original Greek text. However, several reviews suggest improvements for fluency and modernity. A more straightforward version could be "dejaron el barco y a su padre, y lo siguieron a Jesús" (They left the boat and their father and followed Jesus), which would enhance naturalness. While the current phrasing captures the immediacy of the disciples' response, it could emphasize their commitment to abandon worldly ties more strongly. Overall, the translation is solid but has minor areas for improvement to better reflect the gravity of their decision to follow Jesus.

**MAT 6:6**: _(Grade 88.0)_

**Source**:
> σὺ δὲ ὅταν προσεύχῃ, εἴσελθε εἰς τὸ ταμιεῖόν σου, καὶ κλείσας τὴν θύραν σου πρόσευξαι τῷ πατρί σου τῷ ἐν τῷ κρυπτῷ, καὶ ὁ πατήρ σου ὁ βλέπων ἐν τῷ κρυπτῷ ἀποδώσει σοι ἐν τῷ φανερῷ.
> (But when you pray, go into your room and shut the door and pray to your Father who is in secret, and your Father who sees in secret will reward you.)

**Translation**:
> Pero cuando ustedes oren, háganlo a solas, a puerta cerrada; y el Padre de ustedes, que conoce todos los secretos, los recompensará.
> (But when you pray, do it alone, behind closed doors; and your Father, who knows all secrets, will reward you.)

**Combined Review**:
The translation of MAT 6:6 is generally well-executed, providing clarity and accessibility for modern Spanish speakers. The phrases emphasize the personal nature of prayer, reflecting conservative Christian values. While the expressions "a solas, a puerta cerrada" (alone, behind closed doors) capture the intended meaning, suggestions include using "en privado" (in private) to enhance flow and impact. A more direct rendering, akin to "en su cuarto" (in his room), may further convey the intimacy of the prayer experience. Overall, the translation succeeds in communicating the message of sincere private prayer, with room for minor adjustments to enhance clarity and resonance.

**Translation**:
> No se preocupen por lo que sucederá mañana, pues mañana tendrán tiempo para hacerlo. Ya tienen suficiente con los problemas de hoy. (Do not worry about what will happen tomorrow, for tomorrow will have time to deal with it. You have enough with today's problems.)

**Combined Review**:
The translation of MAT 6:34 is generally clear and accessible, fulfilling the objective of being engaging for Spanish speakers in Latin America. Most reviewers agree that the phrase "pues mañana tendrán tiempo para hacerlo" (for tomorrow will have time to deal with it) could potentially misinterpret the intent of the original text, which emphasizes not worrying about the future, rather than implying there will be time to address it later. The essence of the message, which is to trust in God and not be anxious about tomorrow, is recognized, but a more faithful rendering that emphasizes the sufficiency of today’s troubles would enhance clarity and alignment with conservative Christian teachings. Overall, the translation is well done but would benefit from minor adjustments to improve accuracy and theological integrity.

(Translation: But others fell on rocky ground, where there was not much soil, and immediately they sprang up because they had no depth of soil.)

**Translation**:
> Otras cayeron sobre terreno pedregoso, donde la tierra no era muy profunda. Las plantas nacieron pronto, pero a flor de tierra,  
(Translation: Others fell on rocky ground, where the soil was not very deep. The plants sprang up quickly, but at the surface,)

**Combined Review**:
The translation of Matthew 13:5 is well done, capturing the essence of the original text while utilizing modern, accessible Spanish. The phrases 'terreno pedregoso' (rocky ground) and 'donde la tierra no era muy profunda' (where the soil was not very deep) effectively convey the original meaning. However, the expression 'a flor de tierra' (at the surface) may not be the most common phrase in some Latin American dialects. It could be considered to replace it with something simpler, such as 'cerca de la superficie' (near the surface), to ensure clarity across different regions. Overall, the translation maintains clarity and engages the target audience effectively, aligning well with the objective of making the Bible more accessible.

(But he who was sown on good soil, this is the one who hears the word and understands it; indeed, he bears fruit and produces, one a hundredfold, another sixty, and another thirty.)  

**Translation**:
> La buena tierra representa el corazón del hombre que escucha el mensaje, lo entiende y sale a ganar treinta, sesenta y hasta cien almas para el reino de Dios.  
(The good soil represents the heart of man that hears the message, understands it, and goes out to win thirty, sixty, and even a hundred souls for the kingdom of God.)

**Combined Review**:
The translation of MAT 13:23 effectively conveys the essence of the original Greek text while being accessible to Latin American Spanish speakers. The phrase "el corazón del hombre que escucha el mensaje, lo entiende y sale a ganar treinta, sesenta y hasta cien almas para el reino de Dios" (the heart of man that hears the message, understands it, and goes out to win thirty, sixty, and even a hundred souls for the kingdom of God) captures the biblical metaphor well. However, there are concerns regarding the phrase "salir a ganar" (go out to win), which may imply active evangelism rather than emphasizing the fruitfulness associated with understanding God's word. A more faithful rendering could highlight the reception and internalization of the message, suggesting the translation should consider using terms like "cosecha" (harvest) or "fruto" (fruit) instead. While the translation is generally solid and aligns with conservative Christian values regarding evangelism, it could benefit from minor adjustments to better reflect the importance of spiritual growth and fruitfulness inherent in the original text.

**Translation**:
> Ciertos fariseos y jefes judíos de Jerusalén fueron a entrevistarse con Jesús. (Certain Pharisees and Jewish leaders from Jerusalem came to interview Jesus.)

**Combined Review**:
The translation of Matthew 15:1 effectively captures the essence of the original Greek text while making it accessible to Spanish speakers. The phrase 'Ciertos fariseos y jefes judíos de Jerusalén fueron a entrevistarse con Jesús' (Certain Pharisees and Jewish leaders from Jerusalem came to interview Jesus) is generally clear and modern, aligning well with the needs of Latin American audiences. However, there are suggestions to enhance the translation's fidelity to the source. It is recommended to consider using 'fariseos y escribas' (Pharisees and scribes) instead of 'fariseos y jefes judíos' (Pharisees and Jewish leaders) to better reflect the authoritative role of the figures involved. Additionally, the phrase 'fueron a entrevistarse' (came to interview) could be adjusted to a more informal and spontaneous term like 'acercarse a Jesús' (to approach Jesus) to convey the nature of the encounter more accurately. Overall, while the translation meets its objective, these minor adjustments could enhance precision and ensure a more accurate representation of the original biblical context.

> La ley de Dios dice: “Honra a tu padre y a tu madre, y el que maldiga a sus padres, muera irremisiblemente”.  
*(The law of God says: "Honor your father and mother, and whoever curses their parents shall die without remedy.")*

**Combined Review**:
The translation of MAT 15:4 is commendable, capturing the essence and authority of the original text while remaining clear and accessible to modern Spanish-speaking audiences. Phrases such as "La ley de Dios dice" effectively underscore the command's authority, aligning well with conservative Christian perspectives. However, the phrase "muera irremisiblemente" *(shall die without remedy)* has been identified as potentially too formal or archaic. Recommendations include simplifying it to "morirá" *(shall die)* for better resonance and clarity. Overall, the translation is effective and engaging but would benefit from minor adjustments in wording to enhance understanding and relatability without compromising the message.

**Translation**:
> Los discípulos se le acercaron y le dijeron: ―Los fariseos se ofendieron por esas palabras. (The disciples came to him and said, "The Pharisees were offended by these words.")

**Combined Review**:
The translation of MAT 15:12 is generally clear and modern, making it accessible to Spanish speakers in Latin America. While it accurately reflects the original Greek meaning, particularly the disciples' concern about the Pharisees' reaction, there is a consensus among reviewers regarding the choice of the term 'ofendieron'. A more literal translation, such as 'se escandalizaron', might better capture the seriousness and impact of Jesus' words. The translation effectively conveys the context, but slight adjustments could enhance its clarity and emotional weight. Overall, this is a solid translation with room for improvement in terms of conveying the gravity of the situation.

**Translation**:
> Cualquier cosa que uno come pasa a través del aparato digestivo y se expulsa;  
(Anything that one eats goes through the digestive system and is expelled)

**Combined Review**:
The translation of MAT 15:17 effectively conveys the original meaning from the Greek text, achieving clarity and modern accessibility for Spanish speakers. The phrase "Cualquier cosa que uno come pasa a través del aparato digestivo y se expulsa;" (Anything that one eats goes through the digestive system and is expelled) is largely understandable and relatable. However, multiple reviews suggest a slight refinement to enhance the tone to better reflect the seriousness of Jesus’ message regarding inner purity. Suggestions include using the term 'y se desecha' (and is discarded) for a more formal approach and emphasizing directness by possibly including 'la boca' (the mouth) to strengthen the connection with the scripture's intent. Overall, the translation is commendable, meeting its objective well but open to minor improvements for enhanced clarity and respect for the context of the biblical text.

**Combined Review**:
The translation of MAT 15:33 effectively communicates the essence of the original Greek text and uses modern Spanish to engage contemporary audiences. The clarity of the phrase structure is commendable, yet the term "gentío" may not resonate universally across all Spanish-speaking regions; alternatives such as "multitud" could enhance relatability.

**Combined Review**:
The translation of Matthew 19:14 is effectively rendered in modern, accessible Spanish that resonates with Latin American audiences. It captures the essence of Jesus' message regarding the welcome of children into the Kingdom of Heaven. The phrase "No impidan que los niños vengan a mí" is direct and conveys urgency, aligning well with a conservative Christian perspective that values children. However, suggestions for improvement include simplifying the introductory dialogue format to enhance clarity and reverence, such as using "No, no lo hagan —dijo Jesús—" instead of "No, no —intervino Jesús—".

**Combined Review**:
The translation of MAT 20:10 effectively captures the essence of the original Greek text while using modern and accessible Spanish, suitable for Latin American audiences. Reviewers note its clarity in communicating the expectations of the first workers compared to the reality of their compensation, thus reflecting the parable's themes of divine grace and justice. While the overall effort is commendable, minor adjustments could enhance expressiveness, such as simplifying certain phrases for improved flow and explicitly highlighting contrasts in expectations among the workers.

**Combined Review**:
_(Overall Grade: 88.0)_  
The translation of MAT 20:11 is modern and clear, effectively making the scripture accessible for contemporary Spanish speakers, particularly in Latin America. The phrase "Claro, inmediatamente uno de ellos protestó ante el dueño:" communicates the essence of the original Greek text, capturing the sense of complaint while maintaining an engaging tone. However, the use of "protestó" might imply a stronger action than intended, as the original Greek conveys more of a grumbling or complaining nature. Suggestions include using a term like "reclamó" or "se quejó" to better express the dissatisfaction of the workers while still keeping it relatable. Furthermore, the word "Claro" could be replaced with "Entonces" or "Así que" to preserve the narrative tone without being too informal. Overall, the translation successfully meets its objectives with minor adjustments recommended to enhance clarity and emotional impact.

**Translation**:
> Entonces el dueño envió un grupo mayor de hombres a cobrar, pero estos corrieron la misma suerte. (Then the owner sent a larger group of men to collect, but these suffered the same fate.)

**Combined Review**:
The translation of MAT 21:36 effectively captures the essence of the original Greek text while maintaining clarity and accessibility for modern Spanish speakers. The use of terms such as "dueño" (owner) and "grupo mayor de hombres" (larger group of men) resonates well in Latin American Spanish, preserving the meaning without being overly formal. However, there are some suggestions for improvement: using a more literal translation of "more servants" instead of "a larger group" could better reflect the original intent. Additionally, opting for terms like "reclamar" (to claim) instead of "cobrar" (to collect) may align more closely with the sacred context of the parable. Some reviews noted that the phrase "pero estos corrieron la misma suerte" (but these suffered the same fate) could be seen as informal, and a more serious expression might enhance the gravity of the message. Overall, the translation is strong and well-suited for a conservative Christian audience, although slight adjustments could improve fidelity to the original context.

**Translation**:
> Entonces Jesús les preguntó:  
> ―¿Han leído alguna vez en las Escrituras aquello que dice: “La piedra que rechazaron los constructores ha sido puesta como piedra principal. ¡Qué interesante! (The stone that the builders rejected has been put as the chief cornerstone. How interesting!) El Señor lo hizo y es maravilloso? (The Lord did this, and it is marvelous)

**Combined Review**:
The translation of MAT 21:42 captures the essence of the original text while employing a modern style suitable for Latin American Spanish speakers. The phraseology is generally clear and effectively conveys the metaphor of 'the stone that the builders rejected.' However, the expression '¡Qué interesante!' (How interesting!) may come off as too casual for a biblical context, potentially diluting the theological weight of Jesus's message. A more reverent tone, such as '¡Es maravilloso!' (It is marvelous!), could enhance the perception of awe intended in the scripture. Overall, the translation is accessible and maintains the core meaning, but slight adjustments to the tone and phraseology could better align it with conservative expectations while retaining engagement with contemporary readers.

> καὶ τοὺς ἀσπασμοὺς ἐν ταῖς ἀγοραῖς καὶ καλεῖσθαι ὑπὸ τῶν ἀνθρώπων ῥαββὶ ῥαββί. (And the greetings in the marketplaces, and to be called by men, 'Rabbi, Rabbi.')

**Translation**:
> Y cuando andan por las calles, les gusta que les digan: “¡Rabí, rabí!”. (And when they walk in the streets, they like to be called: "Rabbi, Rabbi!")

**Combined Review**:
The translation of MAT 23:7 is strong, effectively conveying the essence of the original text in modern Spanish, which resonates well with Latin American audiences. The phrase 'les gusta que les digan: “¡Rabí, rabí!”' (they like to be called: "Rabbi, Rabbi!") captures the idea of vanity and the desire for recognition that Jesus critiques in this passage. However, while the term 'Rabí' (Rabbi) is retained for cultural significance, a more precise term that conveys the full weight of the title could enhance the translation. Suggestions include using '¡Maestro, Maestro!' (Teacher, Teacher!) or a slightly more formal phrasing to align with the reverence associated with biblical texts in conservative Christian contexts. Overall, the translation is accessible and engaging, but with room for improvement in conveying the deeper nuances of the original term and the critical message of Jesus.

**MAT 26:27**: _(Grade 88.0)_

**Source**:
> καὶ λαβὼν τὸ ποτήριον καὶ εὐχαριστήσας ἔδωκεν αὐτοῖς λέγων· πίετε ἐξ αὐτοῦ πάντες· (And taking the cup and giving thanks, he gave it to them, saying: "Drink from it, all of you.")

**Translation**:
> Tomó luego una copa de vino, la bendijo y también la dio a sus discípulos. (He then took a cup of wine, blessed it, and gave it to his disciples.)
> ―Beban esto, (Drink this,)

**Combined Review**:
The translation of MAT 26:27 is largely accurate and effectively conveys the meaning of the source text, which is central to the Last Supper narrative. The use of modern Spanish makes it accessible to the audience of Latin American Spanish speakers. The phrase 'una copa de vino' is clear, while 'Beban esto' serves as a direct command. However, the ending phrase feels incomplete, lacking additional context that fully represents Jesus' intent, such as including the significance of the cup in relation to His blood. A more formal phrasing, such as 'Tomen y beban esto,' (Take and drink this,) could enhance reverence in this solemn moment. Clarity and theological depth are critical, and slight improvements in phrasing could help communicate the sacramental significance better. Overall, the translation is strong but can benefit from minor adjustments to optimize clarity and convey the full theological intent.

> (All of you will be offended in me this night; for it is written, I will smite the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock shall be scattered.)

**Translation**:
> Allí Jesús les dijo:  
> ―Esta noche ustedes se alejarán de mí desilusionados, porque las Escrituras dicen que Dios herirá al pastor y las ovejas del rebaño se dispersarán.  
> (There Jesus said to them: This night you will be offended in me, for the Scriptures say that God will strike the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock will be scattered.)

**Combined Review**:
The translation of MAT 26:31 effectively captures the essence of the original Greek text and presents it in a clear and modern style suitable for Latin American Spanish speakers. Most reviews commend the accessibility and engagement of the phrasing, particularly the term "Dios herirá al pastor," which maintains theological integrity. However, there are notable concerns about the choice of the term "desilusionados," which some reviewers feel may not fully convey the stronger emotional weight of the original Greek word "σκανδαλισθήσεσθε" (scandalized). A more impactful term could enhance the emotional depth of the translation. Overall, while the translation is commendable for its clarity and relatability, minor adjustments in word choice are recommended to better reflect the gravity of Jesus's message and align with the conservative Christian perspective.

**Translation**:
> Se volvió de nuevo a ellos y los halló dormidos por segunda vez. ¡Tan agotados estaban! (He turned again to them and found them sleeping for the second time. They were so exhausted!)

**Combined Review**:
The translation of MAT 26:43 is clear and adequately reflects the original text. It effectively conveys the meaning in a modern and accessible style suitable for Latin American audiences. However, several reviewers suggested that the phrase "¡Tan agotados estaban!" (They were so exhausted!) may be improved for formality or emotional impact. Alternatives such as "¡Estaban tan cansados!" (They were so tired!) or more compassionate expressions could enhance the depth and clarity while maintaining the gravity of the moment. Overall, the translation achieves its goal of accessibility and relatability, aligning with a conservative Christian perspective while remaining engaging for contemporary readers.

**Translation**:
> Por fin, decidieron comprar cierto terreno de donde los alfareros extraían barro. Aquel terreno lo convertirían en cementerio de los extranjeros que murieran en Jerusalén. (Finally, they decided to buy a certain piece of land where the potters extracted clay. They would turn that land into a cemetery for foreigners who died in Jerusalem.)

**Combined Review**:
The translation of MAT 27:7 is generally strong and effectively conveys the meaning of the original Greek text while maintaining accessibility for modern Spanish speakers. Phrases like 'decidieron comprar' (they decided to buy) and 'cierto terreno de donde los alfareros extraían barro' (a certain piece of land where the potters extracted clay) effectively communicate the decision-making process and context without sounding overly formal. However, there are suggestions for improvement: the term 'cementerio de los extranjeros' (cemetery for foreigners) might be considered less formal and could be revised to 'campo de los forasteros' (field of the outsiders) to better align with conservative interpretations. Additionally, the phrase regarding the potters may be simplified for clarity, and specifying the purpose of the land as a burial ground could enhance comprehension. Overall, the translation adheres well to the original intent and cultural context, with minor adjustments recommended for improved clarity and resonance.

**Translation**:
> Otro de sus seguidores le dijo: (Another of his followers said to him:)  
> ―Señor, te seguiré pero déjame que vaya antes a enterrar a mi padre. (Lord, I will follow you, but let me go first and bury my father.)

**Combined Review**:
The translation of MAT 8:21 is effective in conveying the original meaning while utilizing modern and accessible language for Spanish speakers. It successfully reflects the urgency of the disciple's request to follow Jesus over familial duties. However, there are suggestions for minor improvements: replacing 'seguidores' (followers) with 'discípulos' (disciples) for greater fidelity to the original meaning, and refining the phrasing for clarity and tone. Overall, the translation aligns with conservative Christian values that emphasize immediate discipleship, and while it is a solid effort, it can be enhanced with slight adjustments to enhance its impact.

**MAT 15:14**: _(Grade 88.2)_

**Source**:
> ἄφετε αὐτούς· ὁδηγοί εἰσι τυφλοὶ τυφλῶν· τυφλὸς δὲ τυφλὸν ἐὰν ὁδηγῇ, ἀμφότεροι εἰς βόθυνον πεσοῦνται. (Leave them; they are blind guides of the blind; and if the blind leads the blind, both will fall into a pit.)

**Translation**:
> Así que no les hagan caso, porque son ciegos que tratan de guiar a otros ciegos y lo único que logran es caer juntos en el hoyo. (So do not pay attention to them, because they are blind who try to guide other blind people, and what they achieve is falling together into the pit.)

**Combined Review**:
The translation of MAT 15:14 effectively conveys the essence of the original Greek text while employing modern and accessible language for Spanish speakers. The phrase "son ciegos que tratan de guiar a otros ciegos" accurately reflects the metaphor used by Jesus, highlighting the spiritual blindness of the Pharisees. However, the expression "caer juntos en el hoyo" (falling together into the pit) is seen as potentially too colloquial and may lack the reverence suitable for biblical context. It could be more impactful if replaced with a term like "abismo" (abyss) to enhance the gravity of the warning. Overall, while the translation fulfills the goal of clarity and relatability, it would benefit from slight adjustments to better align with conservative values and maintain the seriousness of the scripture.

**Translation**:
> Esto es lo que de veras corrompe. Pero uno no se corrompe por comer sin lavarse primero las manos. (This is what truly corrupts. But one does not become defiled by eating without first washing hands.)

**Combined Review**:
The translation of MAT 15:20 is well-executed and generally meets the objectives of clarity and accessibility for modern Spanish-speaking audiences. While it effectively conveys the core message of Jesus regarding moral purity and internal corruption over external actions, some phrases, particularly "de veras corrompe" (truly corrupts) and "uno no se corrompe por comer sin lavarse primero las manos" (one does not become defiled by eating without first washing hands), may be viewed as somewhat informal or colloquial, which could distract from the reverent tone expected in biblical translations. A recommendation is to consider more traditional wording for "ἄνθρωπος" (man/human) as "el ser humano" (the human being) to enhance clarity and respectfulness. Overall, the translation successfully balances modern engagement with fidelity to the original text.

**Translation**:
> Pues tómalo y vete. (So take it and go.) Y porque quiero pagarle a todos los trabajadores lo mismo, (And because I want to pay all the workers the same,) ¡no me vengas ahora con que es injusto que yo haga con mi dinero lo que me plazca! (don’t come to me now saying it’s unfair that I do what I want with my money!) Por tanto, (Therefore,) no tienes razón para enojarte. (you have no reason to be angry.)

**Combined Review**:
The translation of MAT 20:14-15 is generally strong, capturing the essence of the original Greek text while using modern and accessible language for Spanish speakers. Most reviewers agreed that the translation effectively conveys the parable's themes of divine grace and generosity. However, there were concerns about the colloquial tone of certain phrases, particularly "¡no me vengas ahora con que es injusto que yo haga con mi dinero lo que me plazca!" (don’t come to me now saying it’s unfair that I do what I want with my money!) This wording may lack the reverence expected in biblical texts. Suggestions included opting for a more formal tone, such as "¿no es justo que yo haga con mi dinero lo que quiero?" (Isn’t it fair for me to do what I want with my money?) to enhance the translation's suitability for conservative audiences. Overall, the translation is well-executed but would benefit from minor adjustments to maintain both engagement and the formal integrity expected of scripture.

**Combined Review**:
The translation of MAT 22:10 effectively captures the essence of the original text while maintaining clarity and accessibility for contemporary Spanish readers, particularly in Latin America. Phrases such as "Los siervos obedecieron y trajeron a cuantos hallaron, lo mismo malos que buenos. Las mesas se llenaron de invitados" convey the narrative well, emphasizing the inclusion of all types of guests at the banquet, a significant theme in this parable. Some reviews suggest enhancing the contrast between 'malos' (bad) and 'buenos' (good) by considering alternatives like 'indeseables' (undesirable) or rephrasing to 'tanto los malos como los buenos' (both the bad and the good) for improved nuance. Additionally, the final phrase could benefit from a stronger emphasis on the servants' obedience leading to the filling of the banquet. Overall, this translation remains faithful to the text, fulfilling the objectives of clarity, accessibility, and engagement for Spanish speakers while allowing for minor refinements in tone and phrasing.

**Combined Review**:
The translation of MAT 25:2-4 is generally clear and accessible, achieving the goal of making the biblical text comprehensible for Spanish speakers, particularly in Latin America. The use of terms like 'sabias' (wise) and 'moraes' (foolish) aligns well with the original Greek and captures the contrasting characteristics of the bridesmaids effectively. The phrase 'llenaron bien las lámparas de aceite' (they filled their lamps with oil well) reflects the actions of the wise maidens, but could be refined for greater fidelity to the source text, perhaps emphasizing the preparation aspect more explicitly. Overall, while the translation is strong and maintains the integrity of the original message, slight improvements in phrasing could enhance clarity and convey deeper nuances from the original text. The effort made to use modern language suitable for a conservative Christian audience is commendable.

**Combined Review**:
The translation of MAT 25:15 is commendable as it successfully conveys the original message while adopting a modern and relatable Spanish style for Latin American audiences. The choice of monetary values, such as 'cincuenta mil pesos' (fifty thousand pesos), is effective for clarity and accessibility; however, it may simplify the deeper theological implications associated with the biblical 'talents'. Several reviews suggested retaining the term 'talentos' (talents) with a footnote to emphasize the concept of responsibility and stewardship central to the parable. Overall, while the translation is clear and engaging, slight adjustments in terminology could enhance understanding and maintain the scriptural intent.

> (The chief priests took the silver.

**Combined Review**:
The translation of MAT 27:6 effectively captures the meaning of the original Greek text and is written in a modern and accessible style for Spanish speakers. The phrase 'dinero contaminado con sangre' communicates the severity of the situation regarding the betrayal of Judas and aligns with conservative Christian interpretations concerning the sanctity of offerings. The reviews note that while the overall accuracy and clarity of the translation are commendable, there are suggestions for minor adjustments to enhance understanding.

**Translation**:
> Los principales sacerdotes, escribas, fariseos y ancianos también se burlaban de él. (The chief priests, scribes, Pharisees, and elders also mocked him.)

**Combined Review**:
The translation of MAT 27:41 is commendable, capturing the original meaning and the mocking tone of the religious leaders towards Jesus during his crucifixion. It effectively uses modern Spanish, making it accessible for contemporary Latin American readers while maintaining the gravity of the scene. However, there are suggestions for minor improvements: maintaining capitalization for 'Fariseos' to show respect for religious titles, and perhaps using stronger language than 'burlaban'—terms like 'se mofaban' or 'se ridiculizaban' may better convey their contempt. Some reviews also suggest restructuring phrases for clarity and emphasizing the seriousness of the situation. Overall, it adheres well to a conservative Christian perspective, aiming to engage readers while preserving the integrity of the biblical text.

> Jesús nació en un pueblo de Judea llamado Belén, durante el reinado de Herodes. Llegaron a Jerusalén varios sabios del oriente,  
>(Jesus was born in a town of Judea called Bethlehem during the reign of Herod. Several wise men from the east arrived in Jerusalem)

**Combined Review**:
The translation of MAT 2:1 successfully conveys the original Greek meaning while remaining clear and accessible to Latin American Spanish speakers. It accurately identifies the birthplace of Jesus (Belén) and the historical context (during the reign of Herodes). However, there are suggestions for refinement to enhance flow and conciseness. Specifically, replacing 'un pueblo de Judea llamado Belén' with 'en Belén, Judea' could improve clarity. Additionally, while 'sabios del oriente' is modern and understandable, using 'magos' (wise men/magi) may better reflect their revered status in the biblical narrative. Overall, the translation is well-executed and aligns with a conservative Christian perspective, but a slight increase in formality could better honor the text.

Most reviewers agreed that the phrasing is clear, making it suitable for contemporary audiences. The urgency in Herod's action is well conveyed with "convocó," and the question about the Messiah's birthplace is engaging. However, there is a consensus that the term "maestros religiosos" (religious teachers) could be adjusted to a more traditional term like "escribas" (scribes) to resonate better with a conservative Christian audience. While the dialogue format adds engagement, some felt it strayed slightly from the original text's formal tone. Overall, the translation is strong, meeting the objectives of clarity and accessibility, though minor adjustments for formality and traditional wording could enhance it further.

The translation of MAT 3:15 generally captures the essence and meaning of the original Greek text, providing a modern and accessible interpretation suitable for Latin American audiences. The phrase "bautízame, porque nos conviene cumplir lo que Dios manda" effectively conveys Jesus' message about fulfilling God's righteousness; however, it may be perceived as slightly casual, lacking the reverence present in traditional translations.

The phrase "lo llevó al lugar más alto del templo de Jerusalén" (he took him to the highest point of the temple of Jerusalem) conveys the significant action and theological implications inherent in the original Greek text.

While the phrase "la regla era que el que matara sería castigado" (the rule was that whoever kills would be punished) communicates the essential meaning, it could benefit from a more direct phrasing to reflect the seriousness of the commandment.

**Translation**:
> ¿Para qué preocuparse de la ropa? ¡Miren los lirios del campo, que no tejen su propia ropa,  
(Why worry about clothing? Look at the lilies of the field, they do not weave their own clothing,)

**Combined Review**:
The translation of MAT 6:28 is overall strong, capturing the essence of the original text and using modern, accessible language for Spanish speakers. It effectively communicates the core message of not worrying about clothing and emphasizes God’s provision through the imagery of the lilies. However, the phrase '¡Miren los lirios del campo, que no tejen su propia ropa,' while engaging, could be refined for clarity. Specifically, the word 'tejen' might suggest an implication of creating clothing, which could detract from the focus on the lilies' lack of concern for their appearance.

**Combined Review**:
The translation of Matthew 7:20 as "Igualmente, una persona se conoce por las acciones que realiza" is generally accurate and clear, successfully conveying the essence of the original Greek text. The reviewers noted that while the translation is accessible and relatable for Spanish speakers, there are opportunities for improvement, particularly in connecting the concept of actions more explicitly to the metaphor of 'fruits.' Suggested enhancements include variations such as "Así que, por sus frutos, reconocerán a las personas" (So, by their fruits, you will recognize people) or "De la misma manera, pueden reconocer a una persona por sus frutos" (In the same way, you can recognize a person by their fruits) to emphasize this connection more effectively.

> Καὶ προσελθὼν εἷς γραμματεὺς εἶπεν αὐτῷ· διδάσκαλε, ἀκολουθήσω σοι ὅπου ἐὰν ἀπέρχῃ. (And a scribe approached him and said, "Teacher, I will follow you wherever you go.")

**Translation**:
> En eso, un maestro de la ley de Dios le dijo: (In this, a teacher of God's law said to him:)
> ―Maestro, te seguiré vayas adonde vayas. ("Teacher, I will follow you wherever you go.")

**Combined Review**:
The translation of MAT 8:19 is commendable for its clarity and accessibility in modern Spanish. The phrase 'Maestro, te seguiré vayas adonde vayas' effectively conveys the disciple's commitment to follow Jesus, maintaining a relatable tone for the audience. However, there are suggestions to refine the term 'maestro de la ley de Dios' to a more neutral term such as 'maestro' or 'escriba' to align closely with the original Greek term 'γραμματεύς' (grammateus). This adjustment would avoid implying specific authority not present in the text. Additionally, ensuring a formal yet accessible tone might enhance the overall reverence of the message. Despite these minor adjustments, the translation aligns well with the objective of engaging Latin American audiences while preserving the original meaning.

**Translation**:
> Ella pensaba que si lo tocaba sanaría. (She thought that if she touched it, she would be healed.)

**Combined Review**:
The translation of MAT 9:21 is generally clear and effectively conveys the original intent of the verse.

Some reviewers recommend revising the phrase to more explicitly express her inner thoughts, suggesting alternatives like 'Ella decía en su corazón: si tan solo toco su manto, seré sanada' (She said in her heart: if only I touch his cloak, I will be healed.) or 'Ella decía para sí misma que si lo tocaba, sanaría.' (She said to herself that if she touched him, she would be healed.) These adjustments would strengthen the connection to her faith and provide better contextual understanding, making the translation even more relatable to contemporary readers. Overall, the translation is solid and aligns well with the conservative Christian perspective on faith and healing.

**Combined Review**:
The translation of MAT 9:31 effectively conveys the meaning of the original Greek text while remaining accessible to modern Spanish speakers, especially in Latin America. Phrases such as 'se pusieron a divulgar' (they began to spread) are engaging, though some reviews suggest more direct alternatives like 'fueron a contar' (they went to tell) or 'comenzaron a proclamar' (they began to proclaim) to enhance the clarity and reverence appropriate for a conservative Christian audience.

**Translation**:
> El que se apegue demasiado a su vida, la perderá; pero el que renuncie a ella porque me ama, la salvará. (He who clings too closely to his life will lose it; but he who renounces it because he loves me will save it.)

**Combined Review**:
The translation of MAT 10:39 is generally well-executed, clearly conveying the essential message of the original Greek text regarding the tension between clinging to life and the call for self-denial in the context of faith in Christ. The phrase "El que se apegue demasiado a su vida, la perderá; pero el que renuncie a ella porque me ama, la salvará" effectively reflects the duality of self-preservation versus self-denial. While it captures the essence and maintains accessibility for Spanish speakers, some reviewers suggested that "apegue demasiado" may be improved for clarity and urgency, proposing alternatives like "se aferre a su vida" or directly translating "el que encuentre su vida" to enhance precision. Overall, the translation is consistent with conservative Christian values, emphasizing the importance of commitment and sacrifice for following Christ.

**Combined Review**:
The translation of MAT 11:19 effectively captures the essence of the original Greek text while utilizing modern and accessible Spanish, appropriate for a Latin American audience. Terms like "glotón" (glutton) and "amigo de cobradores de impuestos" (friend of tax collectors) resonate well with readers, though minor adjustments could enhance clarity and theological depth. Suggested changes include replacing "glotón" (glutton) with a term that conveys excess, like "comedores en exceso" (eaters in excess), and considering more traditional language such as "pecadores" (sinners) instead of "de la peor calaña" (the worst of people).

Phrases like 'no romperá' and 'acabará de apagar' preserve the metaphor well, aligning with conservative Christian perspectives that emphasize the dignity of those in need. While the language is relatable for Latin American audiences, there are suggestions for slight improvements: enhancing the seriousness of the phrase 'hasta que haga triunfar la justicia' (until He leads justice to victory) and providing clearer context regarding 'the justice' referred to in this passage.

The translation of MAT 13:31 is generally clear and effectively conveys the message of the parable, capturing the essence of the original text. Phrases like "una pequeña semilla de mostaza" accurately communicate the imagery of the mustard seed, making it relatable for Spanish-speaking audiences. However, some reviews suggest minor improvements in phrasing for fluidity and reverence, emphasizing the need for terminology that aligns with conservative Christian doctrines. Suggestions include refining the word "plantada" to "sembrada" for agricultural clarity and considering a simplified phrasing of "una semilla de mostaza" to enhance focus on the concept rather than size.

**Combined Review**:
The translation of Matthew 15:19 is recognized for its clarity and accessibility, successfully capturing the essence of the original Greek text. While phrases like "los malos pensamientos" effectively convey the gravity of sin, some reviewers suggest that it could be more emphatic, as the original Greek emphasizes the evil nature of these thoughts.

**Combined Review**:
The translation of MAT 15:36 is generally accurate and captures the essential meaning of the original text. It uses modern Spanish, making it accessible to contemporary readers, particularly in Latin America. The phrase "dio gracias a Dios por ellos" effectively reflects Jesus' act of thanksgiving; however, simplifying it to "dio gracias" might enhance clarity and fluidity.

 (And if your eye causes you to sin, pluck it out and cast it from you; it is better for you to enter into life with one eye, rather than having two eyes to be cast into hell fire.)

**Translation**:

Mejor te es entrar tuerto al reino de los cielos que ir al infierno con los dos ojos. (It is better for you to enter into the kingdom of heaven with one eye than to go into hell with both eyes.)

**Combined Review**:
The translation of MAT 18:9 effectively conveys the original message in a clear and modern Spanish suitable for Latin American readers. While the phrasing 'sácatelo y échalo a la basura' (pluck it out and throw it away) is engaging and accessible, it has been noted as potentially too informal or casual for the gravity of the scripture's context regarding sin and its consequences. Several reviewers suggest alternatives such as 'échalo de ti' (cast it from you) or 'deséchalo' (discard it) to better reflect the seriousness of Jesus's warning. Overall, the translation maintains fidelity to the original text and communicates its urgency, although slight adjustments in phrasing could enhance its respectful tone while preserving accessibility.

**Combined Review**:
The translation of MAT 20:2 effectively conveys the essence of the original Greek text while being accessible to Spanish speakers. The choice of modern language, particularly the phrase "conviene con ellos en pagarles un denario al día," effectively communicates the agreement regarding payment. However, the addition of "que es el salario normal" (which is the normal wage) is seen as an interpretive element that may not directly reflect the original intent of the text, which simply states the payment amount without elaboration. Overall, while the translation is clear and resonates well with contemporary readers, it could be refined to maintain closer adherence to the original structure, particularly by omitting the interpretative addition. This would enhance fidelity without sacrificing clarity. The overall grade reflects these observations, with a strong performance recognized for its clarity and accessibility.

The phrase "se enojaron" (they became angry) captures the essential meaning and emotional response of the disciples, aligning well with the intent of the original Greek text.

The phrase 'Dinos, ¿debe uno pagar impuestos al gobierno romano?' (Tell us, should one pay taxes to the Roman government?) accurately reflects the question posed to Jesus. However, some reviews suggest a minor adjustment to reference 'César' (Caesar) directly, enhancing clarity regarding the authority in question. While the contemporary phrasing makes the translation relatable, it may be seen as less formal compared to traditional translations, which could affect reception among conservative audiences.

**Combined Review**:
The translation of MAT 22:23 effectively captures the essence of the original Greek text while maintaining clarity and accessibility for modern Spanish speakers. It identifies the Sadducees and their disbelief in the resurrection, which is crucial for understanding the context of the passage. While the phrasing is clear and aligns with the goal of engaging Spanish-speaking audiences, there are minor suggestions for improvement.

(Well, there was once a family of seven brothers. The first married and died without having children, so the widow married the second brother. That brother also died without having children, and the wife married the next brother. This repeated until the woman was the wife of all seven brothers.)  

**Combined Review**:
The translation of MAT 22:25-26 is generally well-executed, maintaining clarity and accessibility for Spanish speakers in Latin America, achieving a good balance between fidelity to the original Greek text and readability. However, some suggestions for improvement were made:  
- The phrase "pues bien" could be simplified to "había una vez" for a more natural start.  
- The translation should emphasize the role of the brothers in the marriage customs, reflecting the cultural context more accurately rather than implying the widow's initiative.  
- The expression "la señora fue esposa de los siete hermanos" could be modified to "la mujer fue esposa de los siete" for improved clarity.  
- Additionally, while the narrative flow is clear, incorporating more context about the theological implications of Jesus's teaching on marriage and resurrection would enhance the depth of the translation.

(But after a while, those who stood by came up and said to Peter, "Surely you are one of the disciples of that man; even your speech betrays you!")  

**Combined Review**:
The translation of MAT 26:73 is largely accurate and captures the essence of the original text, effectively conveying both the meaning and urgency of the accusation against Peter. The phrase "No puedes negar que eres uno de los discípulos de ese hombre. ¡Hasta tu manera de hablar te delata!" is well-articulated, engaging, and accessible for modern Spanish speakers, particularly in Latin America. While the modern tone is appropriate, some reviewers noted that emphasizing the identity of Jesus (e.g., by including "Jesús, el Mesías") could reinforce His significance. Overall, the translation is solid and aligns with the objective of making the biblical text relatable while maintaining its integrity. Minor adjustments could enhance clarity and impact, particularly regarding the gravity of the situation.

**MAT 28:10**: _(Grade 88.3)_

**Source**:
> τότε λέγει αὐταῖς ὁ Ἰησοῦς· μὴ φοβεῖσθε· ὑπάγετε ἀπαγγείλατε τοῖς ἀδελφοῖς μου ἵνα ἀπέλθωσιν εἰς τὴν Γαλιλαίαν, κἀκεῖ με ὄψονται.  
(Then Jesus said to them, "Do not be afraid; go and tell my brothers to go to Galilee, and there they will see me.")

**Translation**:
> —No teman— les dijo Jesús—.  
(Don't be afraid— Jesus said to them—.)  
Digan a mis hermanos que salgan en seguida hacia Galilea, y allí me hallarán.  
(Tell my brothers to go right away to Galilee, and there they will find me.)

**Combined Review**:
The translation of MAT 28:10 is largely clear and accessible, effectively communicating the original message to contemporary Spanish speakers. The phrase "No teman" is appropriately comforting, while the instruction "Digan a mis hermanos" conveys Jesus' command. However, the greeting could be improved for theological precision; using something like "¡Saludos!" (Greetings!) or "¡Alegraos!" (Rejoice!) would preserve the reverence of the moment. Additionally, while "salgan en seguida" maintains urgency, a suggestion for naturalness could be to use "vayan enseguida" (go immediately). Despite minor suggestions for enhancing solemnity and tradition, the translation aligns well with the objectives of accessibility and engagement for conservative audiences, with an overall strong performance.

> καὶ ἀπῆλθεν ἡ ἀκοὴ αὐτοῦ εἰς ὅλην τὴν Συρίαν, καὶ προσήνεγκαν αὐτῷ πάντας τοὺς κακῶς ἔχοντας ποικίλαις νόσοις καὶ βασάνοις συνεχομένους, καὶ δαιμονιζομένους καὶ σεληνιαζομένους καὶ παραλυτικούς, καὶ ἐθεράπευσεν αὐτούς· (And his fame went throughout all Syria; and they brought unto him all sick people that were taken with divers diseases and torments, and those which were possessed with devils, and those which were lunatick, and those that had the palsy; and he healed them.)

**Translation**:
> Su fama llegó hasta Siria, y le traían todo tipo de enfermos: No había enfermo, endemoniado, loco o paralítico que le trajeran y a quien no sanara. (His fame went throughout all Syria; and they brought unto him all sick people that were taken with divers diseases and torments, and those which were possessed with devils, and those which were lunatick, and those that had the palsy; and he healed them.)

**Combined Review**:
The translation of MAT 4:24 is overall commendable, successfully conveying the meaning of the original text while making it accessible to a modern Spanish-speaking audience. The phrase 'Su fama llegó hasta Siria' effectively captures the growing reputation of Jesus. However, the clause 'No había enfermo, endemoniado, loco o paralítico que le trajeran y a quien no sanara' may suggest an absolute negation that isn't aligned with the original Greek intent. It would be more precise to rephrase it to emphasize that all types of individuals were healed without implying exclusivity. Furthermore, the term 'loco' could be improved for sensitivity; using 'afectado mentalmente' might be more appropriate. Overall, while the translation meets its objectives and aligns with conservative Christian values, slight adjustments could enhance clarity and fidelity.

Phrases like 'Dichosos ustedes' (Blessed are you) and 'todo tipo de mentiras' (all kinds of lies) effectively convey the essence of the original Greek text. However, there are suggestions for slight improvements, such as emphasizing the reason for persecution more explicitly, possibly by rephrasing for reverence, or adjusting the tone of certain phrases for a more formal context. Overall, the translation is effective, accessible, and captures the core message of the verse concerning persecution for the sake of Christ.

(He spoke another parable to them: "The kingdom of heaven is like yeast, which a woman took and hid in three measures of flour, until it was all leavened.")

**Combined Review**:
The translation of MAT 13:33 effectively communicates the original text's essence in modern, accessible Spanish, appealing to a Latin American audience. While it maintains clarity and good structure, there are areas for improvement.

Overall, the translation fulfills its purpose and reflects a solid understanding of the original message.

(Then Jesus left the crowds and went into the house. And his disciples came to him, saying, "Explain to us the parable of the weeds of the field.")

**Translation**:

(When they had dismissed the crowd, they went back into the house, and his disciples came to him and said, "Explain to us the parable of the weeds and the wheat.")

**Combined Review**:
The translation of MAT 13:36 effectively captures the essence of the original text, presenting the disciples' urgent request for understanding in clear and accessible modern Spanish suitable for Latin American audiences. Phrases like 'despidieron a la multitud' appropriately convey the dismissal of the crowd, while 'mala hierba' accurately reflects 'ζιζάνια.' However, the term 'simbolismo de la mala hierba y el trigo' could be simplified to 'la parábola de la cizaña y el trigo' or 'el significado de la mala hierba y el trigo' to enhance clarity and better align with traditional Christian terminology. Overall, this is a strong translation that meets the goals of accessibility and faithfulness to the biblical message.

**Combined Review**:
The translation of MAT 16:9 is clear and effectively conveys the message of the original text. The use of modern and accessible Spanish helps make the scripture understandable for contemporary readers. However, there are suggestions for improvement: the phrase "¿Cuándo van a entender?" (When will you understand?) could be rephrased to something like "¿No entienden todavía?" (Do you not yet understand?) to better reflect the tone of urgency and surprise in the original Greek, emphasizing Jesus’ frustration. While the choice of words is generally appropriate and the overall message is preserved, increasing the formal tone could enhance its reverence in a sacred context. Furthermore, phrases like "milagrosamente alimenté" (miraculously fed) may better highlight the divine nature of the miracle. Overall, the translation meets its goals while maintaining fidelity to the original biblical text.

**Combined Review**:

The phrase 'si no se vuelven a Dios, arrepentidos de sus pecados y con sencillez de niños' ("if you do not turn to God, repentant of your sins and with the simplicity of children") effectively communicates the call to repentance and humility, aligning well with conservative Christian values. The use of modern Spanish enhances accessibility for Latin American audiences, making the Bible engaging and approachable. However, reviewers suggest slight refinements to the expression to more directly reflect the original Greek concept of 'στραφῆτε' ("to turn") and the notion of becoming 'like children,' which could strengthen the fidelity to the source text. Overall, the translation is effective and fulfills its intended purpose while maintaining theological accuracy.

**Combined Review**:
The translation of Matthew 19:4 effectively captures the essence of the original Greek text and maintains theological significance, presenting it in modern, accessible Spanish suitable for Latin American audiences.

**Combined Review**:
The translation of MAT 20:21 is clear and accurately reflects the essence of the original Greek text. It effectively uses modern and accessible Spanish, making it suitable for Latin American audiences. While the phrasing conveys the inquiry from Jesus and the mother's request well, slight adjustments can enhance clarity and formality. Specifically, adding 'mis' before 'hijos' would personalize the request. Also, while 'trono' is formal, alternatives like 'sitio de honor' could offer a more colloquial touch.

(And he said to them, "You will indeed drink from my cup and be baptized with the baptism I am baptized with; but to sit at my right or left is not for me to grant. These places belong to those for whom they have been prepared by my Father.")

**Translation**:
> ―Pues a la verdad van a beber de mi vaso (Indeed, you will drink from my cup) —les contestó Jesús (Jesus answered them) —y van a bautizarse con mi bautismo (and you will be baptized with my baptism), pero no tengo el derecho de decir quiénes se sentarán junto a mí (but I do not have the right to say who will sit next to me).

The phrases "van a beber de mi vaso" (you will drink from my cup) and "van a bautizarse con mi bautismo" (you will be baptized with my baptism) appropriately reflect Jesus' message about suffering and the significance of His mission. However, the use of "vaso" (cup) is considered somewhat informal, and it is suggested that "copa" (cup) may be a better fit to reflect traditional biblical terminology. Additionally, the phrasing around the Father's authority could be expressed more forcefully to emphasize divine sovereignty, possibly rephrasing "el derecho de decir" (the right to say) to something stronger. Overall, the translation is accessible and engaging for a modern Latin American audience, fulfilling its objective with minor adjustments suggested for improved formality and theological depth.

It successfully captures the essential message of the original Greek text, particularly the significance of the fig tree's failure to produce fruit and the seriousness of Jesus's statement.

(Then he told them the following parable: "A certain man planted a vineyard, fenced it, built a watchtower, and leased it to several tenants. According to the contract, they were to share the product of the vineyard with the owner. The owner went to another region.")  

**Combined Review**:
The translation of MAT 21:33 effectively communicates the meaning of the original Greek text while maintaining accessibility for Spanish speakers in Latin America. The translation preserves the essence and theological implications of the original, making it relatable and understandable for the target audience. Some suggestions for improvement include:
- Consider changing "cercó" to "rodeó" for more natural phrasing.
- The phrase "la arrendó a varios labradores" could imply multiple tenants, which might not accurately reflect the singular "georgois" from the original text. Using "unos labradores" might suggest a more personal connection.
- Phrases could be more idiomatic, such as replacing "los labradores" with "los campesinos" for better resonance with Latin American readers.
- Overall fluidity could be improved, particularly in the sentence about the vineyard's features.

**Combined Review**:
The translation of MAT 24:7 is generally accurate and effectively conveys the essence of the original Greek text. The phrase 'Las naciones y los reinos de la tierra pelearán entre sí' (The nations and the kingdoms of the earth will fight against each other) captures the core message but could be strengthened by adjusting it to 'se levantará nación contra nación y reino contra reino' (nation will rise against nation and kingdom against kingdom) to more closely reflect the original language and prophetic tone. Additionally, while 'y habrá hambrunas y terremotos en diferentes lugares' (and there will be famines and earthquakes in different places) is clear and accessible, a suggestion to simplify it to 'y habrá hambre y terremotos en varios lugares' (and there will be famine and earthquakes in various places) might enhance understanding for modern readers.

**Combined Review**:
The translation of Matthew 24:29 is effective in capturing the original meaning and apocalyptic imagery in a modern, accessible Spanish that resonates with the intended audience in Latin America. The choice of words such as "persecución" (persecution) and "oscurecerá" (will be darkened) appropriately conveys the gravity of the message. However, there are suggestions for improvement regarding clarity. The phrase "y los poderes que están sobre la tierra se conmoverán" (and the powers that are upon the earth will be shaken) could be more accurately rendered to indicate that it refers to heavenly powers, maintaining the theological implications of the passage. While the overall translation is strong, minor adjustments could enhance precision and clarity without sacrificing the engagement and understanding aimed at contemporary readers.

**Translation**:

**Combined Review**:
The translation of MAT 27:31 effectively conveys the essence of the original Greek text, maintaining clarity and modern accessibility for a Latin American audience. The phrase "Por fin, le quitaron el manto, le pusieron su ropa y se lo llevaron para crucificarlo" (At last, they took off the robe, put His clothes on Him, and took Him away to crucify Him) is straightforward and aligns well with contemporary language. However, the use of "Por fin" (At last) may introduce an unintended casual tone that could detract from the gravity of the crucifixion.

The translation of MAT 27:53 is generally clear and accessible, effectively conveying the essence of the original text while aligning with a modern Spanish style. The phrase 'salieron del cementerio' captures the meaning of 'μνημεῖων' (tombs) well. However, the use of 'creyentes muertos' (dead believers) should be reconsidered as it does not reflect the theological significance intended in the original Greek. A more accurate translation would use 'santos' (saints) or 'justos' (righteous) to emphasize the holiness of these individuals, thus enhancing the theological clarity and impact of the text.

Phrases such as "temblando de miedo, se quedaron como muertos" accurately convey the fear experienced by the guards, and the angel's reassurance, "No teman. Sé que buscan a Jesús, el crucificado," maintains the clarity and urgency of the original scripture. However, several reviewers noted the use of the term 'impostor,' suggesting that a term like 'falso profeta' (false prophet) would better reflect the intent without introducing unnecessary harshness.

The translation of MAT 1:18 is generally clear and accurately reflects the original text. The phrase 'Su madre, María, estaba comprometida con José' (His mother Mary was pledged to be married to Joseph) effectively conveys the biblical context of engagement, which is important for conservative readers. However, multiple reviewers noted that the phrase 'hizo que quedara encinta' (made her conceive) may be perceived as informal and suggested alternatives such as 'la hizo concebir' (made her conceive) or 'fue hallada en estado de gestación por obra del Espíritu Santo' (was found to be in a state of gestation by the Holy Spirit) for a more reverent tone. Additionally, the term 'antes de la boda' (before the wedding) was critiqued for its casualness, with suggestions to consider 'antes de consumar su matrimonio' (before consummating their marriage) or 'antes de que se unieran' (before they were united) to align better with traditional language. Overall, while the translation is accessible and meets the needs of contemporary readers, enhancing its reverence and fidelity to traditional Christian values would improve its acceptance among conservative audiences.

While phrases such as 'el diablo lo llevó a la cima de una alta montaña' effectively communicate the event, some reviewers suggested refining 'las naciones del mundo' to 'todos los reinos del mundo' for better alignment with the original term (βασιλείας) which implies authority and power. Additionally, it was recommended to clarify 'la gloria que hay en ellas' to 'su gloria' to specify the reference. Although the translation is accessible and relatable, maintaining a consistent and dynamic style throughout could enhance its quality. Overall, the translation fulfills its objectives well but could benefit from minor adjustments for accuracy and depth.

The translation of MAT 8:16 is largely effective in making the passage accessible and relatable for Spanish-speaking audiences in Latin America. It captures the essence of Jesus' authority over demons and illness. Phrases like "Bastaba una sola palabra" (One single word was enough) highlight His divine power.

The direct speech from Jesus with "Sígueme" effectively captures the immediacy of His call, although there are suggestions to convey Jesus' authority more distinctly and to enhance engagement. While the phrase "junto a la mesa donde se pagaban los tributos" effectively maintains context, some reviews suggested simplifying it to improve fluency, potentially opting for "mesa de impuestos."

**Combined Review**:
The translation of Matthew 9:23 effectively conveys the essence of the original Greek text while utilizing modern and accessible language for Latin American Spanish speakers. The clarity and relatability of the phrasing contribute to understanding Jesus' arrival at the house and the surrounding commotion. However, there are suggestions for slight enhancements; the term "alboroto" (commotion) may not fully capture the emotional context of the situation, with alternatives such as "luto" (mourning) or "clamor" (clamor) recommended to better reflect the funeral setting. While the translation is solid and fulfills its purpose of accessibility and engagement, incorporating additional context regarding the seriousness of the moment and slight variations in word choice could elevate the overall emotional resonance and precision.

**Combined Review**:
The translation of MAT 26:37 captures the emotional depth of the original Greek text and conveys the gravity of Jesus' feelings effectively. While phrases like 'indescriptible tristeza' (indescribable sadness) and 'profunda angustia' (deep anguish) resonate well with a modern audience, some reviewers expressed concern that they may stray from traditional biblical terminology. The reference to 'ya a solas los cuatro' (now alone the four) raises potential confusion, as it inaccurately suggests four individuals were present when only three were with Jesus. Adjustments to these phrases could enhance clarity and faithfulness to scripture, aligning better with traditional translations and the conservative Christian perspective. Overall, the translation maintains a serious tone and fulfills its objective of accessibility while remaining engaging for Spanish speakers.

**Combined Review**:
The translation of MAT 1:6 effectively conveys the genealogical connection from Jesse to David, and from David to Solomon, in a manner that is clear and modern for Spanish speakers in Latin America. While it successfully maintains accessibility and familiarity, several reviewers suggested minor adjustments to improve clarity, particularly regarding the phrase "cuya madre fue esposa de Urías" (whose mother was the wife of Uriah), which could better highlight the significance of Bathsheba in the genealogy of Jesus Christ.

Suggested adjustments are minimal but would enhance precision and contextual clarity without losing the original meaning.

**Combined Review**:
The translation of MAT 2:6 is generally effective in conveying the original Greek text's essence while remaining accessible and engaging for modern Spanish-speaking audiences. Most reviews agree that while the translation retains the central message, particularly regarding Bethlehem's significance and the prophetic leader's role, there are a few stylistic concerns that could be improved.  

Critics noted that the phrase "no eres la menos importante de Judá" could be rephrased for greater impact, suggesting alternatives that highlight Bethlehem's importance more directly, such as "no eres la más pequeña" or simply emphasizing it as "no eres insignificante". Additionally, the term "caudillo" may not be widely understood and could be replaced with simpler terms like "líder" or "guía" to enhance clarity across various Spanish-speaking contexts.  Overall, the translation is commendable for its clarity and faithfulness to the original, though slight adjustments in phrasing could strengthen its theological and literary impact.

**MAT 3:3**: _(Grade 88.8)_

(Years ago, the prophet Isaiah spoke of John and described him thus:  
> "A voice cries in the wilderness: 'Prepare the way for the Lord; let nothing obstruct His path.'")

**Combined Review**:
The translation of MAT 3:3 is generally strong and effectively conveys the message of Isaiah regarding John the Baptist in a clear and engaging manner suitable for Spanish-speaking audiences. However, the phrase "Siglos atrás" (Years ago) is seen as diminishing the immediacy and significance of the prophetic message and could be improved to "Hace mucho tiempo" (A long time ago) or a similar expression to maintain both accessibility and emotional impact. While the choice of contemporary language in the imperative phrase, "Prepárenle el camino al Señor; que nada le estorbe a su paso" (Prepare the way for the Lord; let nothing obstruct His path), effectively communicates urgency, some reviewers suggest it slightly deviates from the original text's literal meaning. Overall, the translation is clear, coherent, and resonates well with the target audience while maintaining fidelity to the source. Minor adjustments are recommended for greater alignment with conservative Christian perspectives.

The translation of Matthew 3:7 is generally accurate and conveys the seriousness of John the Baptist's message. The term "Crías de víboras" (Brood of vipers) effectively reflects the urgency and warning inherent in the original Greek, which aligns well with conservative Christian interpretations. While the phrase "la ira de Dios que vendrá sobre ustedes" (the wrath of God that will come upon you) maintains the concept of impending divine judgment, it could be enhanced for greater directness to better emphasize the urgency of the warning. Despite this, the translation remains accessible and clear for modern Spanish speakers, effectively capturing the intent of the passage without losing the weight of its message. Overall, it is a strong translation with minor adjustments recommended for improved fluidity and impact.

However, multiple reviews suggest that the term "capaces de destrozarlos" (able to tear you apart) may be considered overly dramatic or graphic and could be softened to align better with a more biblical tone of caution, such as using "lobos rapaces" (rapacious wolves) or "lobos que pueden devorarlos" (wolves that can devour them) instead. Additionally, while the use of "disfrazados de ovejas" (disguised as sheep) is clear, it could be perceived as less formal than traditional translations. Overall, the translation is strong and meets the objective of accessibility, but minor adjustments are recommended to enhance sensitivity and maintain the seriousness of the biblical message.

**Combined Review**:
The translation of MAT 8:22 is generally clear and maintains the intended meaning of the original Greek text. It effectively captures the essence of Jesus' message regarding the urgency of discipleship. While the phrasing is modern and accessible to Spanish speakers, particularly in Latin America, some reviews suggest that the expression 'deja que los que están muertos se ocupen de sus muertos' (let the dead bury their own dead) may slightly diminish the urgency of Jesus' call. Adjustments towards a more formal tone could enhance clarity without sacrificing engagement. Overall, the translation succeeds in being understandable and relevant to contemporary audiences while aligning with conservative interpretations of the scripture.

**Combined Review**:
The translation of MAT 9:8 successfully captures the original Greek text's essence, conveying the amazement of the crowd and their glorification of God in a manner accessible to modern Spanish speakers. The phrase "Un escalofrío de temor sacudió a la multitud" (A chill of fear shook the crowd) effectively reflects the crowd's awe but may be viewed as slightly informal for biblical text. A more reverent expression could enhance its suitability for conservative Christian audiences.

> ―¿Por qué su Maestro anda con gente de esa calaña? —preguntaron a los discípulos. ("Why does your Teacher associate with people of such caliber?" they asked the disciples.)

**Combined Review**:
The translation of MAT 9:11 is commendable for effectively conveying the original text's meaning in a modern and accessible style for Spanish speakers. The phrase "gente de esa calaña" successfully captures the Pharisees' disdain, reflecting a conversational and relatable tone. However, it has been noted that a more direct translation of "su Maestro" to something like "el Maestro de ustedes" might enhance the connection to the original Greek and clarify the relationship between the Pharisees and the disciples.

It captures the essence of John the Baptist's inquiry about Jesus while maintaining a modern and engaging style for Spanish speakers. While phrases such as "los milagros que el Mesías estaba realizando" (the miracles that the Messiah was performing) are effective, there are suggestions to restructure for clarity and enhance the reverence associated with the biblical context.

The translation of MAT 12:44 has been well received for its clarity and modern accessibility to Spanish speakers, particularly in Latin America. Phrases such as "Es mejor que regrese a la casa de donde salí" effectively convey the spirit's message while maintaining a contemporary tone.

The translation of MAT 13:14 is generally well-executed, accurately reflecting the original Greek text while ensuring clarity and accessibility for a contemporary Spanish-speaking audience. It effectively conveys the essence of Isaiah's prophecy and maintains the necessary theological significance. However, minor adjustments could enhance its engagement with readers. Suggestions include adopting a more conversational tone and emphasizing the prophetic nature of Isaiah's words to resonate with conservative audiences. The phrasing "Oirán, pero no entenderán; verán, pero no percibirán" could benefit from a more emphatic structure to capture the dramatic context better, and using 'entender' in place of 'percibir' might align more closely with traditional interpretations.

The translation of Matthew 13:48 is generally clear and accessible, successfully conveying the meaning of the original text in a modern and relatable style for Spanish speakers, especially in Latin America. While the phrase 'Los buenos los echa en una canasta y los malos los desecha' (The good ones he puts in a basket and the bad ones he discards) captures the separation between good and bad fish, some reviews suggest that using terms like 'arroja' (throws) or 'tira' (throws) could enhance the strength of the language, reflecting the solemnity of the scripture. A slightly more formal approach, such as 'Los buenos son colocados en una canasta, mientras que los malos son desechados' (The good ones are placed in a basket, while the bad ones are discarded), may balance modern language with reverence for the text.

Additionally, enhancing the phrase regarding the divine perspective could strengthen theological clarity by emphasizing the implications of Jesus referring to Peter as "Satanás". Overall, the translation faithfully captures the original Greek meaning and aligns well with a conservative Christian viewpoint, though slight adjustments in word choice and structure could improve fluidity and theological precision.

**Translation**:  
> Los discípulos se postraron en tierra temblando de miedo.  
(The disciples fell to the ground trembling with fear.)

The translation of MAT 17:6 is effective in conveying the original Greek text's meaning while using modern, accessible Spanish appropriate for Latin American audiences. The phrase "temblando de miedo" captures the fear experienced by the disciples well, maintaining the emotional weight of the moment.

**Source**:
> ὅστις οὖν ταπεινώσει ἑαυτὸν ὡς τὸ παιδίον τοῦτο, οὗτός ἐστιν ὁ μείζων ἐν τῇ βασιλείᾳ τῶν οὐρανῶν. (Whoever humbles himself like this child is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven.)

**Translation**:
> En otras palabras, el que esté libre de altivez como este niño tendrá un puesto importante en el reino de los cielos. (In other words, whoever is free from pride like this child will have an important position in the kingdom of heaven.)

**Combined Review**:
_(Overall Grade: 90/100)_: The translation of Matthew 18:4 successfully conveys the essence of the original Greek text in modern Spanish, effectively communicating the important message of humility emphasized by Jesus. The phrase 'el que esté libre de altivez como este niño' successfully captures the spirit of childlike humility. However, several reviews suggest that using a more direct translation of 'humble' would strengthen the rendering. Phrases like 'tendrá un puesto importante' could also be refined to better align with traditional biblical language, such as using 'es el mayor' (is the greatest), to emphasize status in the kingdom of heaven more accurately. Overall, while the translation is solid and accessible for contemporary audiences, minor adjustments could enhance clarity and theological precision.

**Translation**:
> ―Entonces, ¿por qué dice Moisés que uno puede romper los lazos matrimoniales con su esposa siempre y cuando le dé una carta de divorcio? —le preguntaron. ("So why did Moses command to give a certificate of divorce and send her away?" —they asked.)

**Combined Review**:
The translation of MAT 19:7 is largely accurate and conveys the meaning of the original Greek text while employing a modern and accessible style suitable for Latin American audiences. While the phrasing effectively communicates the Pharisees' question regarding Moses' allowance for divorce, the expression "romper los lazos matrimoniales" (break the marital bonds) could be revised for greater clarity and alignment with biblical language, using "divorciarse" (to divorce) instead. This would enhance comprehension for contemporary readers without compromising the essence of the original message.

**Combined Review**:
The translation of MAT 20:20 effectively communicates the original text's meaning and context while utilizing a modern and accessible Spanish style appropriate for Latin American audiences. However, there is a consensus among reviewers regarding the phrasing 'la esposa de Zebedeo' (the wife of Zebedee), which may lead to confusion, as it does not align with traditional interpretations that refer to her as the 'mother of the sons of Zebedee.' Therefore, using 'la madre de los hijos de Zebedeo' (the mother of the sons of Zebedee) is recommended for greater clarity and theological accuracy. Additionally, while phrases like 'se arrodilló ante él' (knelt before him) are appropriately reverent, slight adjustments could enhance the overall formality in line with biblical language conventions. Overall, the translation is well-executed, meeting its accessibility objectives while remaining respectful of the sacred nature of the text.

The translation of MAT 21:23 is generally effective and successfully captures the essence of the original Greek text in a modern and accessible style appropriate for Latin American Spanish speakers. The phrasing maintains the theological significance of the authority question posed to Jesus, conveying urgency and a confrontational tone. However, there are suggestions for improvement: the term "jefes judíos" (Jewish leaders) may be seen as too broad and could be made more specific for clarity; the phrase "exigirle que les explicara" (demand that He explain to them) may be perceived as too confrontational and could be softened to reflect a more neutral inquiry, such as "preguntarle sobre su autoridad" (ask Him about His authority). While some reviews noted that the translation is a bit lengthy, the overall clarity and modernity make it accessible. Care should be taken to balance faithfulness to the original text with engagement and relatability for the audience. Overall, the translation is strong and aligns well with the intended objectives.

The phrase "¿Qué creen ustedes que hará el dueño cuando regrese?" (What do you think the owner will do when he returns?) maintains the interrogative form, inviting engagement and reflection, which is crucial for understanding the parable's implications. However, several reviews pointed out minor issues with punctuation, specifically the unnecessary period after the quotation marks and a closing question mark placement that does not conform to Spanish typographical norms. Additionally, while the clarity of the translation is commendable, there is a suggestion to emphasize the seriousness of Jesus's question further, which aligns with its theological context. Overall, the translation is suitable for contemporary audiences, reflecting a solid understanding of the source material and the goal of accessibility for Spanish speakers.

> (With this, I want to say to you that God will take away the kingdom of heaven from you, and give it to people who bear the fruits He expects.)

**Combined Review**:
The translation of MAT 21:43 is clear and accessible, effectively conveying the core message of the verse in a modern style suitable for Spanish speakers. However, there are areas for improvement regarding the tone and formality. While "Dios les va a quitar el reino de los cielos" is direct and captures the seriousness of the judgment, a more reverent phrasing such as "Dios les quitará" could enhance the authority of the message. The expression "gentes que den los frutos que él espera" effectively communicates the expectation of fruitful living but could benefit from a more traditional or formal phrasing to align with conservative Christian values. Overall, while the translation maintains clarity and engagement, slight refinements in vocabulary and tone could improve its alignment with traditional interpretations and enhance its theological weight.

**Translation**:

**Combined Review**:
The translation of MAT 23:4 effectively captures the essence of the original Greek text and is both clear and accessible, particularly for Spanish speakers in Latin America. The phrase "Recargan a la gente de mandamientos que ni ellos mismos intentan cumplir" conveys the hypocrisy and burdens imposed by the Pharisees while maintaining a modern style that resonates well with contemporary audiences. However, several reviewers noted that emphasizing the heavy and burdensome nature of the commandments more explicitly could enhance the translation's depth and impact. Additionally, a slight refinement in word choice, such as using "cargan" or "imponen" instead of "recargan," could lend a more formal tone suitable for religious contexts. Overall, the translation meets its objective of being accessible and understandable while remaining faithful to the original message of the scripture.

**Combined Review**:
The translation of MAT 23:15 is mostly accurate and effectively captures the original meaning. The phrase 'hijos del infierno' (sons of hell) communicates the seriousness of Jesus' condemnation but may be perceived as too strong by some audiences. Suggestions for improvement include considering a more sensitive alternative like 'hijos de la condenación' (children of condemnation) to maintain theological accuracy while enhancing accessibility.

**Combined Review**:
The translation of MAT 24:40 is generally clear, engaging, and accessible for modern Spanish-speaking audiences. It successfully captures the urgency and theological implications of the passage regarding the return of Christ. While the phrases 'Cuando yo venga' (When I come) and 'dos hombres estarán trabajando juntos en el campo' (two men will be working together in the field) convey the intended meaning, there are suggestions for simplification to enhance clarity and fluidity, such as using 'dos hombres estarán en el campo' (two men will be in the field) instead.

The choice of wording successfully conveys the sense of timing and delay related to the bridegroom. However, there are opportunities for improvement. Suggestions include using a more vivid word than "demoraba" to enhance the sense of anticipation and expectation, and possibly rephrasing "se quedaron dormidas" to "todas se durmieron" (they all fell asleep) for greater impact and activity in the expression. Overall, the translation meets the objectives of clarity, engagement, and theological integrity, with minor adjustments that could enrich its expression.

The translation of MAT 26:8 is commendable, as it successfully captures the essence of the original Greek text while maintaining clarity and accessibility for modern Spanish speakers.

The translation of MAT 26:74 is generally strong, with most reviewers appreciating how it captures the essence of the original Greek text while maintaining clarity and accessibility for Spanish speakers. However, there are mixed opinions regarding specific word choices and phrasing. The use of "maldecir" (to curse) and "jurar" (to swear) effectively conveys Peter's denial and emotional state; however, some reviews suggest that these terms might carry a heavier implication than intended, and recommend a tone that aligns more closely with the seriousness of the moment.

**Combined Review**:
The translation of MAT 27:20 is generally effective and maintains clarity for modern Spanish-speaking audiences in Latin America. It captures the original Greek text's essence while engaging the reader. However, there are areas for improvement:  
- The phrase 'que no perdían tiempo' might suggest informality and could benefit from a more neutral expression, like 'que rápidamente persuadieron.'  
- The term 'gentío' could be replaced with 'multitud' for better understanding across various Latin American contexts.  
- Phrasing like 'que pidieran que soltaran a Barrabás y mataran a Jesús' may introduce interpretive nuances that diverge from traditional readings, suggesting a direct call for Jesus' execution rather than focusing on the contrast between the two figures.

> Cuando al amanecer del domingo María Magdalena y la otra María regresaban a la tumba,  
(Translation: When at dawn of Sunday Mary Magdalene and the other Mary were going to the tomb,)  

**Combined Review**:
The translation of MAT 28:1 is generally well-received, successfully conveying the essence of the original Greek text in modern, accessible Spanish suitable for Latin American audiences. However, a recurring suggestion across reviews is to replace the phrase "regresaban a la tumba" (were returning to the tomb) with alternatives such as "fueron a la tumba" (went to the tomb) or "se dirigían a la tumba" (were heading to the tomb) to more accurately reflect the original intent of the women's action without implying a prior departure. Additionally, enhancing clarity by explicitly stating "al amanecer" (at dawn) to convey the meaning of "ἐπιφωσκούσῃ" (the light breaking of dawn) could further strengthen the translation's impact. While the translation meets the overall objectives well, these minor adjustments are recommended to enhance precision and clarity, ensuring faithfulness to the original text while maintaining engagement for contemporary readers.

**Source**:
> καὶ ταχὺ πορευθεῖσαι εἴπατε τοῖς μαθηταῖς αὐτοῦ ὅτι ἠγέρθη ἀπὸ τῶν νεκρῶν, καὶ ἰδοὺ προάγει ὑμᾶς εἰς τὴν Γαλιλαίαν· ἐκεῖ αὐτὸν ὄψεσθε· ἰδοὺ εἶπον ὑμῖν.  
> (And quickly, go and tell His disciples that He has risen from the dead, and behold, He is going before you to Galilee; there you will see Him; behold, I have told you.)

**Translation**:
> Ahora, váyanse pronto y díganles a los discípulos que él ya se levantó de los muertos, que se dirige a Galilea y que allí los espera. Ya lo saben.  
> (Now, go quickly and tell His disciples that He has risen from the dead, and He is going before you to Galilee; there you will see Him. Behold, I have told you.)

**Combined Review**:
The translation of MAT 28:7 effectively conveys the core message and urgency of the original text while maintaining a modern and accessible style suitable for a Latin American audience. Phrases such as "ya se levantó de los muertos" (He has risen from the dead) clearly communicate the resurrection of Jesus, which is fundamental to conservative Christian belief. However, the phrase "ya lo saben" (they already know) has raised some concerns as it may imply that the disciples were already aware of this revelation, which could dilute the urgency of the angel's command. A more fitting alternative could enhance the sense of importance and novelty in the message. Despite these minor issues, the translation succeeds in its objective to make the Bible engaging and culturally relevant, earning commendable scores across the reviews.

Most reviews appreciate its clarity and accessibility for Latin American audiences, highlighting that it maintains the integrity of the original text while using modern, relatable language. Phrases like 'no hagan como hacen los hipócritas' (do not do as the hypocrites do) are noted for their straightforwardness and effectiveness.

(Heal the sick, cleanse the lepers, raise the dead, cast out demons; freely you have received, freely give.)

**Translation**:

**Combined Review**:
The translation of MAT 10:8 is generally clear and well-executed, capturing the essence of the original Greek text. It effectively communicates the message using accessible language that resonates with a Latin American audience. The phrase regarding receiving power freely and not charging for services adds clarity to the principle of grace; however, it introduces nuances not explicitly found in the Greek text. Some reviewers noted that the phrase 'resuciten muertos' (raise the dead) may come off as casual or misinterpreted and suggested alternatives like 'devuelvan la vida a los muertos' (bring life back to the dead) to maintain gravity. Additionally, while the informal term 'cobren' (charge) is seen as potentially problematic, alternatives such as 'no pidan pago' (do not ask for payment) were recommended.

**Combined Review**:
The translation of Matthew 11:28 is clear and effectively captures the essence of the original Greek text. The choice of words such as 'cansados' (weary) and 'afligidos' (burdened) conveys Jesus' invitation to those who are struggling, making it relatable to modern Spanish speakers. However, some reviewers suggested that the term 'afligidos' (burdened) might be better replaced with 'agobiados' (overwhelmed) or 'cargados' (laden) to more accurately reflect the Greek 'πεφορτισμένοι' (heavy laden). The structure is generally engaging and accessible, though a more explicit connection to the concept of spiritual rest could enhance its impact. Overall, the translation is strong but could benefit from slight refinements in phrasing to improve clarity and depth.

**Combined Review**:
The translation of MAT 15:23 successfully conveys the original Greek text's meaning while utilizing modern, accessible Spanish suitable for Latin American audiences. The phrase "Jesús no le respondió ni una sola palabra" captures Jesus' silence effectively, emphasizing this critical narrative aspect. However, the disciples' line, "que ya nos tiene cansados," while relatable, may come off as too colloquial and could potentially diminish the seriousness of the situation.

The translation of MAT 27:24 is generally clear and accessible, employing modern Spanish that is suitable for Latin American audiences. The phrases used effectively convey the essence of Pilate's declaration of innocence, maintaining the gravity of the situation while ensuring the text is relatable. However, there is a consensus that certain phrases, particularly "¡Allá ustedes!", may be perceived as too informal for the solemnity of the context. Some reviews suggested that terms reflecting greater seriousness or formality could enhance the translation.

The use of the phrase "lo obligaron a llevar la cruz que Jesús cargaba" (they compelled him to carry the cross that Jesus was carrying) captures the coercive nature of Simon of Cyrene's involvement. However, reviewers noted that this phrasing could suggest a less significant role for Simon, recommending adjustments for clarity. Suggestions include replacing "obligaron" (compelled) with "forzaron" (forced) to emphasize compulsion, and using "que Jesús llevaba" (that Jesus was carrying) instead of "que Jesús cargaba" (that Jesus was carrying) to better convey the burden aspect.

The translation of Matthew 3:14 effectively captures the original Greek text while being accessible and engaging for Spanish speakers. Phrases such as "¡Tú eres el que debería bautizarme a mí!"

The translation of MAT 6:12 captures the essence of the original Greek text well. It maintains clarity and accessibility for modern Spanish speakers, which is essential for engaging the audience. The phrase 'perdona nuestros pecados' is a clear translation, but the choice of the word 'pecados' instead of 'deudas' (debts) can be debated.

**MAT 14:3**: _(Grade 89.2)_

**Source**:
> ὁ γὰρ Ἡρῴδης κρατήσας τὸν Ἰωάννην ἔδησεν αὐτὸν καὶ ἔθετο ἐν φυλακῇ διὰ Ἡρῳδιάδα τὴν γυναῖκα Φιλίππου τοῦ ἀδελφοῦ αὐτοῦ. (For Herod had seized John and bound him and put him in prison for the sake of Herodias, his brother Philip's wife.)

**Translation**:
> Este Herodes era el que había prendido a Juan y lo había encadenado en la cárcel por exigencias de Herodías, que había sido esposa de su hermano Felipe. (This Herod was the one who had seized John and bound him in prison for the sake of Herodias, who had been the wife of his brother Philip.)

**Combined Review**:
The translation of MAT 14:3 is generally well-executed, clearly conveying the meaning of the original Greek text. Most reviewers noted that while the translation effectively captures the essence of Herod's actions regarding John the Baptist, there is some room for improvement in terms of conciseness and fluidity. Phrases such as 'exigencias de Herodías' (demands of Herodias) might not resonate universally among Spanish speakers, suggesting that more familiar or contemporary alternatives could enhance engagement. The overall style is modern and accessible, which aligns well with the intended audience, but slight adjustments could make it read more naturally and improve its immediacy. While the translation maintains theological significance, further refinement for clarity and smoothness could help achieve an even better balance between faithfulness to the source text and readability for contemporary audiences.

**MAT 14:17**: _(Grade 89.2)_

**Source**:
> οἱ δὲ λέγουσιν αὐτῷ· οὐκ ἔχομεν ὧδε εἰ μὴ πέντε ἄρτους καὶ δύο ἰχθύας. (But they said to him, "We have here only five loaves and two fish.")

**Translation**:
> ―¿Pero con qué, si no tenemos más que cinco panecillos y dos pescados? (But with what, if we have only five loaves and two fish?)

**Combined Review**:
The translation of MAT 14:17 effectively communicates the original meaning of the Greek text in a clear and accessible modern Spanish style. The phrasing, "¿Pero con qué, si no tenemos más que cinco panecillos y dos pescados?" (But with what, if we have only five loaves and two fish?) captures the disciples' concern and reflects their limited resources in a conversational tone, making it relatable for Latin American audiences. However, some reviewers noted a slight inconsistency in the tone, as the phrase "más que" (more than) implies a comparison that may not fully convey the original Greek's emphasis on scarcity. Suggestions included using "solamente" (only) instead of "más que" (more than) to enhance the urgency and importance of their lack. While "panecillos" (small loaves) is familiar, a recommendation was made to consider simplifying it to just "pan" (bread) for broader understanding. Additionally, while the translation is strong, it could benefit from a slight emphasis on the miraculous aspect of the event, a critical element from a conservative Christian perspective. Overall, the translation is effective, engaging, and maintains the essence of the biblical narrative.

**Translation**:
> a pesar de que había cerca de cinco mil hombres, además de las mujeres y los niños! (despite there being about five thousand men, not counting the women and children!)

**Combined Review**:
The translation of MAT 14:21 captures the essence of the original Greek text effectively while maintaining a modern and accessible style for Spanish-speaking audiences, particularly in Latin America. While it successfully conveys the significant detail of approximately five thousand men present, the use of the phrase "cerca de" (about) could suggest a degree of approximation that might be considered less precise than the original text. Reviews noted the importance of emphasizing that the figure represents men only, and a more definitive phrasing could enhance clarity and respect for the biblical account. Suggestions for rephrasing include stating "había unos cinco mil hombres, sin contar a las mujeres y los niños" (there were about five thousand men, not counting the women and children), which would emphasize the magnitude of the miracle more clearly. Overall, the translation is clear and engaging, appropriately balancing accessibility and reverence for scripture, though a few minor adjustments could further enhance its effectiveness.

**Translation**:
> Los discípulos, al verlo, gritaron llenos de espanto: ―¡Es un fantasma! (The disciples, seeing him, cried out in fear: 'It is a ghost!')

**Combined Review**:
The translation of MAT 14:26 effectively conveys the meaning and emotional essence of the original Greek text while using modern and accessible language suitable for Spanish-speaking audiences. However, the phrase '¡Es un fantasma!' could be reconsidered for a more reverent tone. Suggestions include using '¡Es un espíritu!' (It is a spirit!) to reflect a more conservative Christian perspective, emphasizing the supernatural aspect of the moment rather than simply expressing fear. Although the translation is clear and relatable, slight adjustments in tone and clarity regarding the context of the disciples' fear may enhance its suitability for a conservative Christian audience. Overall, the translation is commendable, effectively capturing both the intent and emotion of the original scripture.

**Translation**:
> Pedro, inquieto, lo llamó aparte y lo reprendió: (Peter, anxious, called him aside and rebuked him:)
> ―¡Dios guarde, Señor! —le dijo—. ¡A ti no te puede pasar eso que dices! ("God forbid, Lord! —he said—. That shall not happen to you!")

**Combined Review**:
The translation of MAT 16:22 is generally accurate and effectively conveys the meaning of the original text. The phrase "¡Dios guarde, Señor!" captures Peter's concern in a modern context; however, it could potentially confuse readers with its colloquial tone. Suggested alternatives such as "¡Ten compasión, Señor!" or "¡Esto no te sucederá, Señor!" may better reflect the gravity of Peter's reprimand. Additionally, while the use of "reprendió" is acceptable, alternatives like "llamó la atención" or simplifying it to "lo apartó y le dijo" could enhance the clarity and tone, making it feel more immediate and less formal. Overall, the translation succeeds in maintaining a contemporary style suitable for Latin American audiences while emphasizing Peter's protective instinct over Jesus' future suffering.

Terms like "se estremecieron de tristeza y temor" were noted for potential refinement to better convey their emotional state. Suggestions included using alternatives like "se llenaron de tristeza y temor" and emphasizing the phrase "yo resucitaré" for stronger resonance within a Christian context. Overall, the translation successfully aligns with a conservative Christian perspective while being clear and engaging for the target audience.

("If your hand or your foot causes you to stumble, cut it off and throw it away. It is better for you to enter life maimed or crippled than to have two hands or two feet and be thrown into eternal fire.")

**Translation**:
> Por lo tanto, si tu mano o tu pie te hace pecar, córtatelo y échalo de ti, porque es mejor entrar al reino de los cielos mutilado que ir a parar al infierno con las dos manos y los dos pies.

**Combined Review**:
The translation of MAT 18:8 effectively conveys the seriousness of Jesus's message about sin and the drastic measures required to avoid it. The use of modern Spanish is accessible and relatable for Latin American readers. However, the phrase 'echalo de ti' ("throw it away") may be perceived as too colloquial and could diminish the gravity of the message.

**Combined Review**:
The translation of Matthew 19:19 effectively communicates the core message of honoring parents and loving one's neighbor, which is fundamental in a conservative Christian context. Most reviewers praised the modern and accessible language, making it engaging for Spanish speakers. However, several noted that the phrase "con la misma sinceridad con que te amas a ti mismo" (with the same sincerity with which you love yourself) introduces an interpretive element that slightly diverges from the traditional wording "como a ti mismo" (as yourself).

While the translation effectively communicates the narrative, it could benefit from slight refinements to enhance fluidity and conciseness, such as simplifying 'andan en busca de trabajo' (who are looking for work) to 'buscaban trabajo' (they were looking for work) to reflect a more direct approach. Additionally, integrating a sense of urgency regarding the characters' situation, perhaps by noting their 'idleness' (idle) or 'unemployment', could enrich the context.

**Combined Review**:
The translation of MAT 21:9 is engaging and captures the essence of the original Greek text. While the familiar language makes it accessible to Spanish speakers, several reviews suggest a more literal approach to phrases such as '¡Viva el Hijo del rey David!'

**Combined Review**:
_(Overall Grade: 90)_: The translation of MAT 27:66 is generally clear and faithful to the original Greek text, effectively conveying the essential meaning in a modern and accessible Spanish style.

While the structure is mostly coherent and maintains a solemnity fitting for a conservative Christian audience, minor adjustments in phrasing could enhance clarity and flow. Overall, the translation fulfills its objective of making the scripture accessible and engaging for modern Spanish speakers, though there is room for improvement in accuracy and terminology choice.

**Translation**:
> ―Señor —le dijo entonces el capitán—, no soy digno de que vayas a mi casa. Desde aquí mismo puedes ordenar que se sane mi criado y se sanará.

The choice of the term "Señor" (Lord) and the structure of sentences reflect both the reverence for Jesus and the humility of the centurion effectively.

Additionally, while the word "criado" (servant) is used, "sirviente" (servant) may resonate more with contemporary audiences. Overall, the translation captures the essence of humility and faith, although slight adjustments could enhance its impact and clarity. It meets the objective well and is commendable for its overall execution.

**MAT 17:1**: _(Grade 89.3)_

**Combined Review**:
The translation of MAT 17:1 is generally clear and retains the meaning of the original text while being accessible for contemporary Spanish speakers. The phrase "seis días después" accurately captures the timeline. While the use of "subió a la cima de un elevado monte" is correct, simplifying it to "monte alto" may enhance fluidity and relatability for the audience.

The contemporary Spanish style is engaging and accessible for Latin American readers, successfully maintaining the clarity and theological weight of the original Greek text.

**Combined Review**:
The translation of MAT 22:15 is generally well-received, scoring an average of 89.3. Reviewers commend its clarity and effectiveness in conveying the original Greek text's essence in modern Spanish, making it suitable for a Latin American audience. The use of terms like 'tramar' (to plot) and 'enredar' (to ensnare) is highlighted as effective in communicating the deceitful intent of the Pharisees. However, some reviewers suggest that 'enredar' may come off as too casual for a biblical context, proposing alternatives such as 'atrapar' (to catch) or 'planear' (to plan) for maintaining seriousness. Furthermore, the phrase 'en sus propias palabras' (in their own words) may mislead the reader about the subject, with suggestions to refine it for clarity on the specific reference to Jesus.

It maintains clarity and relatability, particularly with phrases like "sentarse a las cabeceras de las mesas" (sit at the head of the tables), which conveys honor and status. However, several reviews suggest that certain phrases may benefit from a more formal tone and reverence given the context of Jesus’ critique. Expressions like "¡Ah, y...!" (Ah, and...!) could come off as informal and might be refined for a more respectful biblical context. Some reviewers also recommended considering alternatives to "cabeceras" for clarity, such as "mesas principales" (main tables) or "lugar de honor" (place of honor).

**Combined Review**:
The translation of MAT 25:21 is generally strong, receiving an average grade of 89.3. It effectively conveys the essence of the original Greek text while remaining accessible and engaging for modern Spanish-speaking audiences. The enthusiastic phrase "¡Magnífico!" ("Magnificent!") captures the joy and approval of the master but deviates slightly from traditional translations like "¡Bien hecho!" ("Well done!") which is more commonly used in conservative contexts. The term "celebrar tu éxito" ("celebrate your success") is seen as casual and may not fully reflect the theological intent of entering into the master's joy, which emphasizes reverence rather than personal achievement. Several reviews suggest emphasizing the joyous aspect of entering into the master's presence to align more closely with traditional interpretations. Despite these minor adjustments for improvement, the translation succeeds in making the message relatable while maintaining its integrity, meeting the needs of both accessibility and theological richness for its target audience.

**Combined Review**:
The translation of MAT 25:22 is generally accurate and clear, successfully maintaining the original meaning while using modern, accessible Spanish. Phrases like "Señor, me diste veinte mil pesos y aquí tienes cuarenta mil" effectively convey the servant's report. However, the term "pesos" could be regionally specific; a more neutral term like "talentos" (talents) might be preferable to preserve the parable's context. Additionally, while "presentó su informe" (presented his report) maintains accountability, it might imply formality that detracts from the straightforward nature of the verse. Consider using a phrase like "he aquí otros cuarenta mil" (here are forty thousand more) to emphasize the increase more clearly.

**Combined Review**:
The translation of MAT 27:17 is generally well-executed and aligns closely with the source text, achieving a balance between clarity and accessibility for modern Spanish speakers, particularly in Latin America. While the phrasing is largely clear, the use of 'gentío' is appropriate and familiar.

The translation of Matthew 27:18 is generally well-executed, effectively capturing the original meaning and intent of the scripture. The phrase "porque estaban celosos de la popularidad que había alcanzado en el pueblo" (because they were jealous of the popularity he had attained among the people) accurately conveys the reason for the arrest, aligning with conservative Christian values by emphasizing the envy of the Jewish leaders. While the use of the term "dirigentes judíos" (Jewish leaders) is modern and accessible, some reviews suggest a preference for more traditional terminology such as "sacerdotes" (priests) or "autoridades" (authorities) to better reflect the specific roles of the leaders involved. Additionally, some reviews recommend enhancing the contrast between Jesus’ innocence and the leaders' wrongful actions, which is critical from a conservative perspective. Overall, the translation meets the objectives well, but slight adjustments in terminology and emphasis could improve its alignment with conservative Christian viewpoints.

**Translation**:

However, some suggestions for improvement include considering a more immediate phrasing than "caerá" (perhaps using "recibirán" - you will receive) and enhancing clarity by possibly rephrasing "justos asesinados" (justs who have been killed) to "justos que han sido asesinados."

While the translation successfully conveys the theological intent, these slight modifications would further improve fluidity and precision, aligning the translation more closely with traditional theological understandings. Overall, this translation aligns well with the conservative Christian perspective and meets the objectives of accessibility and engagement.

The phrase "consíguete una o dos personas que vayan contigo a hablarle y te sirvan de testigos" effectively communicates the original intent of gathering witnesses for accountability in conflict resolution.

The phrase "A un rico le es muy difícil entrar al reino de los cielos" captures the essence of Jesus' warning regarding wealth and spiritual entrance.

The phrase 'después de una ausencia prolongada' accurately conveys the idea of the master's delay and return, which is crucial in the context of the parable.

The translation of MAT 4:11, "El diablo se fue, y ¡los ángeles llegaron a atender a Jesús!" (The devil left, and the angels came to attend to Jesus!) effectively conveys the original Greek meaning while maintaining an accessible and modern Spanish style suitable for Latin American audiences. While the translation is clear and engaging, the phrase '¡los ángeles llegaron a atender a Jesús!' (the angels came to attend to Jesus!) may come off as somewhat informal and could benefit from a more reverent tone, such as "los ángeles vinieron a servir a Jesús." (the angels came to serve Jesus.) Several reviewers noted that the exclamation mark might not align with traditional scripture presentation and suggested a more neutral phrasing to preserve the seriousness of the moment. However, the translation captures the significance of divine assistance after temptation and aligns well with a conservative Christian understanding. Overall, it successfully achieves its objective, making the text relatable while retaining its essential message.
