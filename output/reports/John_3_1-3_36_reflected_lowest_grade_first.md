However, the phrase 'perform the miraculous signs' could be simplified to 'do the signs' to reflect a more direct translation of the Greek phrase 'ταῦτα τὰ σημεῖα.' Additionally, the phrase 'unless God is with him' maintains the intended meaning but could be more accurately rendered as 'unless God is with him' for clarity. Overall, it is a solid translation but could benefit from minor adjustments to enhance clarity and fidelity to the original text.

**Review 6** _(Grade 90)_: The translation of JHN 3:2 is accurate and remains faithful to the original Greek text.
