| Reference | Verse | Translation Notes |
|:---------:|-------|-------------------|
|MAT 3:1|"In those days, John the Baptist appeared, preaching in the wilderness of Judea." 

*Footnote: John's ministry in the wilderness symbolizes a call to repentance and preparation for the coming Messiah, reflecting the prophetic tradition of preparing the way for the Lord.*|In revising MAT 3:1, the goal is to enhance clarity and align with traditional biblical language while preserving the literal meaning of the text. The phrase 'In those days' will be maintained for continuity, and 'appeared' will replace 'emerged' to fit more closely with biblical style. 'Preaching' will replace 'proclaiming' to emphasize John's role in a more impactful manner. Stylistic adjustments will be minimal but will aid in readability. The footnote will be refined to emphasize the significance of John's ministry in the wilderness without losing theological depth. Overall, the focus is on producing a translation that is clear, faithful, and theologically rich.|
|MAT 3:2|And saying, 'Repent, for the kingdom of heaven has come near.'|I will revise MAT 3:2 to align with the suggested corrections. This includes maintaining the core message about repentance and the kingdom of heaven while adjusting the language for clarity and formality. I'll simplify the footnote regarding the kingdom of heaven and God to avoid detracting from the translation's directness. Additionally, I'll adopt the phrase 'has come near' for a more contemporary yet formal tone. The updated translation will reflect these changes, ensuring it conveys the urgency and theological significance intended in the original text.|
|MAT 3:3|For this is he of whom the prophet Isaiah spoke, saying: 'A voice of one crying out in the wilderness, Prepare the way of the Lord; make straight His paths.'|The goal is to produce a literal translation of Matthew 3:3 that enhances clarity, emphasizes theological significance, and maintains urgency. I will focus on rephrasing 'make His paths straight' to 'make straight His paths' for improved flow, while also stressing the importance of readiness for the Lord. The urgency of the message will be highlighted through the use of active language. I will ensure the translation is unique by avoiding common phrases from well-known versions, while adhering to conservative Christian translation standards.|
|MAT 3:4|"John wore clothing made of camel's hair, with a leather belt around his waist; and his food was locusts and wild honey." 

*Footnote: John's choice of clothing and diet is reflective of prophetic figures in Jewish tradition, symbolizing simplicity and a call to repentance.*|To enhance the clarity of MAT 3:4 while keeping the literal translation intact, I will simplify the phrasing, focusing on making it more fluid without losing the original meaning. The phrase will be adjusted to maintain a direct reference to John's attire and food, while also including cultural context in a footnote to aid understanding.|
|MAT 3:5|Then came out to him all Jerusalem and all Judea, and all the region around the Jordan.|In refining the translation of Matthew 3:5, the objective is to incorporate feedback regarding clarity, directness, formality, and structural fidelity to the Greek text. The use of 'Jerusalem' instead of 'people from Jerusalem' enhances directness. The phrase 'came out to him' reflects the intended movement more accurately than 'went out to him'. Additionally, maintaining the original structure by leading with 'Then' and positioning 'all Jerusalem and all Judea' at the forefront aligns with a more literal translation approach. These adjustments together foster a translation that is both accurate and respectful of the solemn nature of scripture.|
|MAT 3:6|And they were baptized by John in the Jordan River, confessing their sins.|In reviewing Matthew 3:6, the aim is to clarify who performed the baptism by retaining 'baptized by John' for better context. Additionally, simplifying the phrase 'confessing and acknowledging their sins' to 'confessing their sins' will enhance the translation's naturalness. I will ensure 'in the Jordan River' is specified for consistency with previous verses. Providing supplementary materials on the theological significance of baptism and confession will also align with the conservative Christian perspective. Lastly, I will focus on maintaining accessibility for readers while ensuring fidelity to the original text.|
|MAT 3:7|But when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming for his baptism, he said to them, 'You offspring of vipers! Who has warned you to flee from the coming wrath?'|To effectively translate MAT 3:7 while adhering to the provided corrections, I will prioritize a literal translation of the original Greek text. Retaining the phrase 'offspring of vipers' captures the original intensity and meaning. I will replace 'impending judgment of God' with 'the coming wrath' for greater fidelity to the Greek. Additionally, I will avoid adding interpretative phrases to ensure the translation remains true to the source. The final translation should maintain a sense of urgency and directness, reflecting John's stern warning to the Pharisees and Sadducees.|
|MAT 3:8|Therefore, bear fruit worthy of repentance.|The goal is to create an updated translation of MAT 3:8 that is faithful to the original Greek while also incorporating the peer review suggestions for improvement. By replacing 'produce' with 'bear' and adjusting the phrasing to 'worthy of repentance', the translation aligns better with traditional biblical language and enhances its clarity and resonance for a conservative Christian audience. Therefore, the final translation will incorporate these suggested changes while ensuring that the overall meaning remains intact and true to the original text.|
|MAT 3:9|And do not think to say among yourselves, ‘We have Abraham as our father.’ For I tell you, God is able to raise up children for Abraham out of these stones.|To enhance clarity and urgency in the translation, I will replace 'presume' with 'think to say' for a stronger tone. Additionally, I will use 'out of these stones' instead of 'from these stones' to vividly illustrate God's power. I will also ensure the flow of the sentence improves without losing the original message. Finally, I will keep in mind the theological significance regarding faith and heritage, making sure the emphasis is on personal faith and God's sovereignty rather than just ancestry.|
|MAT 3:10|The axe is already laid at the root of the trees; therefore, every tree that does not produce good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.|In this verse, the metaphor of the axe signifies imminent judgment. The 'root of the trees' emphasizes the source of life and fruitfulness, implying that true righteousness must originate from a genuine relationship with God. The terms 'cut down' and 'thrown into the fire' indicate a definitive and irrevocable judgment for those not producing good fruit, which reflects the broader theme of accountability in the New Testament.|
|MAT 3:11|"I indeed baptize you in water for repentance; but He who comes after me is mightier than I, whose sandals I am not worthy to carry. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and with fire."|The aim for MAT 3:11 is to produce a translation that is both literal and theologically sound while ensuring clarity and flow. I will refine the original translation by simplifying phrases without losing the meaning or depth of the text. It's essential to emphasize the distinction between John's baptism and that of Jesus, maintaining a strong theological stance on Christ's superiority. I'll focus on using direct language that aligns with contemporary understanding while being faithful to the original Greek. Finally, I will ensure that this new translation does not closely resemble existing ones to avoid plagiarism.|
|MAT 3:12|His winnowing fork is in His hand, and He will thoroughly cleanse His threshing floor; He will gather His wheat into the barn, but the chaff He will burn with unquenchable fire.|To enhance clarity, I will replace 'thoroughly clean out' with 'thoroughly cleanse,' which carries a stronger connotation of purification. I will also restructure the second part to emphasize the act of separation between wheat and chaff, underlining the urgency of judgment. The theological implications will be carefully considered to ensure they remain central to the interpretation of this passage.|
|MAT 3:13|Then Jesus came from Galilee to the Jordan to be baptized by John.

*Footnote: This significant event marks the commencement of Jesus' public ministry, illustrating His identification with humanity and His commitment to fulfill all righteousness.*|In revising Matthew 3:13, I will ensure that the translation closely mirrors the original Greek while maintaining readability. I'll avoid terms like 'approaching' to emphasize a direct translation of 'came.' The footnote will focus on the theological significance of this event, succinctly highlighting Jesus's identification with humanity and His role in fulfilling righteousness. I will ensure consistency in terminology and format, aligning with previous translations in this context.|
|MAT 3:14|But John stopped Him, saying, "I need to be baptized by You, and why do You come to me?"|To enhance clarity and engagement, I will rephrase the question to include 'why do You come to me?'. This adds a conversational tone. I will also simplify the phrase 'I have need to be baptized by You' to 'I need to be baptized by You', which maintains formality yet improves readability. Additionally, I will replace 'prevented' with 'stopped' to increase accessibility without compromising theological significance. I will make sure that the revised structure maintains the original's theological context, particularly John's humility and acknowledgment of Jesus' authority.|
|MAT 3:15|But Jesus replied to him, "Permit it now; for it is proper for us to fulfill all righteousness." Then John permitted Him.|To refine the translation of MAT 3:15, I will maintain fidelity to the original Greek text while making stylistic adjustments for clarity and fluidity. The focus will be on emphasizing the theological significance of Jesus' statement and ensuring the structure aligns closely with the Greek syntax, enhancing understanding without compromising the literal meaning.|
|MAT 3:16|As soon as Jesus was baptized, He came up out of the water. At that moment, the heavens were opened to Him, and He saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and coming to rest on Him.|In this translation, the emphasis is on the immediacy of Jesus' baptism and the significant event of the heavens opening, which signifies divine approval and the anointing of Jesus by the Holy Spirit. The metaphor of the dove reflects purity and peace, typical of the biblical symbolism associated with the Holy Spirit.|
|MAT 3:17|And behold, a voice from the heavens said, 'This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.'|In addressing the feedback, I will revise the translation of Matthew 3:17 to improve fidelity to traditional biblical language and closely align with the phrasing commonly used in conservative Christian circles. Specifically, I will change 'in whom I take great delight' to 'in whom I am well pleased,' as this phrase captures the theological weight of the original text more accurately and resonates with traditional biblical translations. Additionally, I will consider retaining 'And behold' to maintain the formal tone, but will evaluate if this can be simplified while still being faithful to the original text. My aim is to present a translation that is both literal and consistent with the conservative Christian perspective.|
