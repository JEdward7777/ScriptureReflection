| Reference | Verse | Translation Notes |
|:---------:|-------|-------------------|
|MAT 17:1|After six days, Jesus took Peter, James, and John, his brother, and led them up a high mountain by themselves.|The phrase 'high mountain' reflects the Greek term used in the source text. It emphasizes the significance of the location in relation to the event of transfiguration. The specific mention of Peter, James, and John illustrates the close relationship Jesus had with these disciples, reinforcing the importance of personal experience in spiritual matters.|
|MAT 17:2|And He was transfigured before them; His face shone like the sun, and His clothes became white like light.|To revise MAT 17:2 effectively, I will prioritize maintaining a literal translation while also ensuring clarity and readability. I will simplify the language and make minor structural adjustments to improve the flow of the sentence, avoiding redundancy. The goal is to enhance the imagery without compromising the original meaning, ensuring that the text remains accessible and theologically sound. Additionally, I will check for consistency with the surrounding verses to ensure coherence within the narrative.|
|MAT 17:3|And behold, they saw Moses and Elijah talking with Him. 

[Contextual Note: The appearance of Moses and Elijah signifies the fulfillment of the Law and the Prophets in Jesus. Moses represents the Law, given to guide God's people, while Elijah embodies the prophetic tradition, pointing towards the coming Messiah. Their presence affirms Jesus’ authority and mission as the culmination of God's redemptive plan.]|In revising MAT 17:3, I will maintain the strong phrase 'And behold' to capture the significance of the moment while replacing 'appeared' with 'they saw' for clarity. Additionally, I will include contextual notes that elaborate on the roles of Moses and Elijah as symbols of the Law and the Prophets, enhancing the theological depth appropriate for a conservative Christian perspective.|
|MAT 17:4|Responding, Peter said to Jesus, 'Lord, it is good for us to be here. If You wish, let us make three tabernacles here—one for You, one for Moses, and one for Elijah.' 

[Contextual Note: Peter's suggestion reflects a desire to prolong this sacred encounter and connect it to Jewish tradition, symbolizing God's presence among His people.]|In revising Matthew 17:4, I will focus on preserving the depth of 'tabernacles' to retain its biblical significance while ensuring readability by opting for 'let us make three tabernacles' instead of 'let us construct three tabernacles'. Additionally, I'll streamline the contextual note to succinctly reflect Peter's desire to honor this divine moment while highlighting its ties to Jewish tradition and the theological implications of God's presence. The formal tone will be maintained throughout the translation, resonating with conservative Christian values.|
|MAT 17:5|While he was still speaking, a bright cloud overshadowed them, and behold, a voice out of the cloud said, 'This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased; hear him!'|In this revision of MAT 17:5, the goal is to enhance clarity while remaining faithful to the source text. The phrase 'in whom I take delight' will be changed to 'in whom I am well pleased,' which is more familiar in conservative Christian contexts. Additionally, I will rephrase 'listen to him' to 'hear him' to underscore Jesus' authority. Throughout the translation process, it is vital to keep the language clear for modern readers while maintaining a literal and respectful representation of the original text.|
|MAT 17:6|And when the disciples heard this, they fell on their faces to the ground and were terrified.|The goal is to create an updated translation of Matthew 17:6 that enhances the emotional impact while remaining faithful to the original text. Replacing 'deeply afraid' with 'greatly terrified' or 'terrified' will heighten the emotional response. Additionally, clarifying 'fell on their faces' to 'fell on their faces to the ground' emphasizes the act of worship and submission. I will aim for a concise yet impactful footnote that aligns with the literal translation approach. This will result in a translation that captures the intensity of the disciples' reaction without straying from the source material.|
|MAT 17:7|And Jesus came and touched them, saying, 'Rise, and do not fear.'|To enhance the translation of Matthew 17:7, I will retain its faithfulness to the original Greek while improving the word choice for clarity and emotional impact. The phrase 'laid His hand upon them' will be refined to 'touched them' to emphasize physical comfort, while still respecting the formal tone of conservative Christian values. The comforting directive 'Rise, and do not fear' will remain unchanged to preserve the reassuring nature of Jesus' words. Additionally, I will maintain a slightly formal tone to align with conservative interpretations and add cultural context for depth.|
|MAT 17:8|And raising their eyes, they beheld no one but Jesus only.|To enhance the translation of MAT 17:8, I will implement the suggested changes. First, I will replace 'lifted up their eyes' with 'raising their eyes' to adhere more closely to the Greek structure. Second, I will refine 'except Jesus alone' to 'no one but Jesus only' to improve clarity and emphasis on the singularity of Jesus' presence. Third, I will consider the term 'beheld' instead of 'saw' to maintain a more traditional biblical language. Lastly, I will structure the sentence to reflect a more formal and solemn tone, fitting for this pivotal moment in the narrative.|
|MAT 17:9|And as they were coming down from the mountain, Jesus commanded them, saying, 'Tell no one about the sight that you have seen until the Son of Man has risen from the dead.'|To improve the translation of MAT 17:9, I will focus on enhancing clarity and specificity by replacing 'the vision which you have seen' with 'the vision that you have seen' or 'the sight'. I will also emphasize the importance of 'the Son of Man' by rephrasing it to maintain its significance, ensuring the translation is both literal and accessible. I will consider providing contextual clarity without introducing elements that have been omitted. This involves precise word choices to ensure there is no ambiguity while staying true to the source text.|
|MAT 17:10|And His disciples asked Him, 'Why then do the scribes say that Elijah must come first?'|In revising MAT 17:10, the focus will be on adhering closely to the original Greek text while enhancing clarity and simplicity. The suggested corrections include using a direct translation of 'scribes', modifying the phrasing from 'must first come' to 'must come first', replacing 'assert' with 'say', and using a more straightforward translation of 'ἐπηρώτησαν'. The goal is to produce a translation that is both literal and comprehensible without losing the nuances of the original text.|
|MAT 17:11|And Jesus answered them, 'Amen, Elijah is coming first and will restore all things.'|In revising the translation for Matthew 17:11, I will focus on enhancing the literalness while ensuring the theological context is clear. The use of 'And' instead of 'But' will improve the flow of the passage. I will consider 'Amen' for its biblical roots, as it is an affirmation that aligns well with the original Greek. I will also emphasize the significance of 'restores all things' to reflect its prophetic implications, but I will maintain the translation's originality to avoid plagiarism.|
|MAT 17:12|But I say to you, Elijah has already come, and they did not know him; rather, they did to him whatever they wanted. In the same way, the Son of Man is destined to suffer at their hands.|In revising Matthew 17:12, the focus will be on clarity and formal tone, incorporating the corrections provided while ensuring theological integrity is maintained. The phrase 'did not know him' is preferred as it closely reflects the Greek meaning. Rephrasing 'treated him as they pleased' to 'did to him whatever they wanted' clarifies the actions taken. Additionally, I'll tighten the sentence structure for better readability while preserving the weight of Jesus' statement regarding suffering. These adjustments should align with a conservative Christian interpretation and enhance the overall impact of the translation.|
|MAT 17:13|Then the disciples understood that He was speaking about John the Baptist. [Footnote: This connection between Elijah and John the Baptist highlights John's role in fulfilling the prophetic expectation of Elijah's return.]|In revising MAT 17:13, I will focus on enhancing the clarity of the verb used to express the disciples' realization. I will choose 'understood' for its directness and fidelity to the original text. The translation will adhere closely to the Greek while ensuring it remains accessible. The theological context regarding John the Baptist's role as Elijah will be succinctly presented in a footnote, offering depth without detracting from the main text. The overall tone will remain formal yet clear, aiming to effectively convey the message while engaging with the original language nuances.|
|MAT 17:14|"And when they came to the crowd, a man kneeling before Him said, 'Lord, have mercy on my son.'" (Footnote: Kneeling was a common expression of respect and supplication in ancient Jewish culture.)|I will address the phrasing of the verse to enhance clarity and alignment with the Greek structure, opting for 'kneeling' instead of 'fell on his knees'. The request for emotional weight will be captured in the phrasing 'have mercy on my son' to reflect urgency while maintaining the direct translation. I'll avoid redundancy and ensure the tone remains formal, reinforcing the reverence appropriate for the text. Additionally, I will prepare a footnote to provide cultural context regarding kneeling in ancient Jewish customs, enriching the reader's understanding without altering the main text.|
|MAT 17:15|"Lord, have mercy on my son, for he is epileptic and severely afflicted; for he often falls into the fire and often into the water." (Footnote: The term 'epileptic' reflects a condition historically believed to be influenced by lunar cycles, similar to what was once termed 'moonstruck.')|In revising Matthew 17:15, I will ensure that the terminology reflects contemporary language while retaining historical accuracy. I will replace 'moonstruck' with 'epileptic' to improve clarity for modern readers. Additionally, I will change 'badly afflicted' to 'severely afflicted' to emphasize the urgency of the father's request. To enhance emotional resonance, I will use stronger language that reflects the desperation in the father's plea. I will keep the footnote explaining the term 'moonstruck' to provide historical context without overwhelming the reader, making sure it's concise and informative. Finally, I will rephrase the overall sentence slightly for improved accessibility without losing the original meaning.|
|MAT 17:16|"And I brought him to the disciples, but they were unable to heal him."|In light of the provided corrections, the objective is to create a translation that maintains clarity and faithfulness to the original Greek text while also considering the feedback regarding word choice and formal structure. The original phrasing 'Your disciples' will be adjusted to 'the disciples' to provide neutrality. I will also focus on emphasizing the disciples' inability to heal the boy while ensuring the sentence structure enhances readability. Overall, the aim is to produce a polished translation that reflects the original meaning accurately and respects the conservative Christian perspective.|
|MAT 17:17|Jesus replied, 'O unbelieving and perverse generation! How long must I be with you? How long must I put up with you? Bring the boy here to Me.'|In this verse, Jesus expresses His frustration with the lack of faith among the people. The term 'faithless' captures both disbelief and the consequences of a corrupt generation, while 'perverse' reflects moral deviation. The phrase 'how long' emphasizes His endurance and the urgency of their need for faith. The command 'bring him to Me' shows His willingness to intervene despite the unbelief surrounding Him.|
|MAT 17:18|And Jesus rebuked him, and the demon came out of him, and the boy was healed from that very hour.|In this verse, the action of Jesus commanding the demon to leave is highlighted. The phrase 'He rebuked him' suggests authority and power over unclean spirits, while the healing of the boy emphasizes the compassion and restorative power of Jesus. The term used for 'demon' in this context indicates an evil spirit that has control over the boy, and the phrase 'from that hour' marks the immediate effectiveness of Jesus' command.|
|MAT 17:19|Then the disciples approached Jesus privately and said, 'Why could we not cast it out?'|To provide an updated translation of MAT 17:19, I will focus on maintaining fidelity to the original Greek text, ensuring clarity and conciseness, and using consistent terminology that aligns with conservative Christian interpretations. The updated translation will directly reflect the disciples' confusion while avoiding interpretive additions that might obscure the straightforwardness of the verse. Additionally, I will capitalize 'Jesus' throughout and omit redundant explanatory footnotes to enhance the verse's simplicity and focus on its core message about faith and authority.|
|MAT 17:20|And Jesus said to them, 'Because of your unbelief. Truly, I say to you, if you have faith as a mustard seed, you will say to this mountain, “Move from here to there,” and it will move, and nothing will be impossible to you.'|To create an updated translation of Matthew 17:20 that aligns with the provided corrections, I will focus on making the translation more literal while retaining the original meaning. I will revise the phrasing to reflect a more direct translation of the command to the mountain and adjust the phrasing about faith and impossibility to better align with the original text. Additionally, I will ensure that the explanatory footnote about the mustard seed does not overshadow the main message of the verse.|
|MAT 17:21|However, this kind does not go out except by prayer and fasting.|This verse emphasizes the necessity of prayer and fasting in spiritual warfare, particularly in relation to faith and the challenges faced by believers. It highlights that certain spiritual breakthroughs require a deeper level of commitment through these practices.|
|MAT 17:22|As they were journeying through Galilee, Jesus said to them, 'The Son of Man is about to be handed over to men.' [Footnote: This statement highlights the impending betrayal and suffering of Jesus, aligning with the prophetic Scriptures regarding the Messiah's mission and foreshadowing his redemptive suffering and resurrection.]|In revising Matthew 17:22, I will prioritize clarity and theological emphasis while maintaining the formal tone characteristic of biblical translations. I will simplify the phrasing to make the verse more accessible without losing the urgency of the message. I will adjust the footnote to further connect this statement to its prophetic significance in the context of Jesus' mission. I will ensure that the updated translation uses 'handed over' to reflect the original Greek meaning accurately. Finally, I will avoid redundancy and ensure that the translation remains consistent in tone and style.|
|MAT 17:23|and they will kill him, and on the third day he will be raised up.' And they were greatly distressed.|This verse speaks of the fate of Jesus and the emotional response of His disciples to the prediction of His death and resurrection. The phrase 'they will kill him' emphasizes the brutality of the events to come, while 'on the third day he will rise' points to the hope and assurance of His resurrection. The term 'greatly distressed' reflects the depth of sorrow experienced by the disciples upon hearing this news, conveying both the foreboding and the significance of the events to unfold.|
|MAT 17:24|"When they arrived in Capernaum, the collectors of the temple tax, which was two drachmas, approached Peter and asked, 'Does your teacher not pay the temple tax?'"|In re-evaluating MAT 17:24, I will focus on providing a translation that is not only literal and faithful to the original Greek but also accessible and culturally informative for modern readers. I will simplify phrases to enhance clarity and directly integrate an explanation of the cultural context of the 'two-drachma tax' into the translation. This approach ensures that the significance of the tax is immediately clear, reinforcing the understanding of Jewish customs. Additionally, I will adjust the flow of the dialogue to enhance readability while preserving the original meaning. I will keep in mind the conservative Christian perspective to maintain the respect for the text and its implications within the faith community.|
|MAT 17:25|He said, 'Yes.' And when he entered the house, Jesus spoke to him first, saying, 'What do you think, Simon? From whom do the kings of the earth collect taxes? From their own sons or from others?'|In revising MAT 17:25, I will ensure a literal translation that reflects the Greek text's nuances while enhancing clarity for contemporary readers. I will simplify terminology where possible and provide contextual insights into the implications of taxation and Jesus' identity as the Son of God. I will change 'anticipated' to a more direct term that conveys Jesus' immediate understanding of the situation. Finally, I will streamline phrases for better flow without losing the essence of the original text.|
|MAT 17:26|Peter replied, 'From others.' Jesus said to him, 'Then the sons are free.'|In this verse, Jesus is teaching about the relationship between children and the obligations of the rulers, implying that as sons, they are free from such duties. The use of 'others' (ἀλλοτρίων) signifies those outside of one's family, contrasting the sons of kings with outsiders. The essence of freedom is emphasized here, indicating a deeper theological principle of belonging and inheritance.|
|MAT 17:27|But to avoid scandalizing them, go to the sea, cast a fishing hook, and take the first fish that comes up. When you open its mouth, you will find a stater; take that and give it to them as payment for you and me. [Footnote: A stater was a silver coin equivalent to four didrachmas, used in the ancient world for temple tax.]|In updating MAT 17:27, I will ensure clarity by retaining phrases like 'to avoid scandalizing them' as it conveys the intention behind Jesus' instruction. I will use 'cast a fishing hook' for grammatical precision and readability. The term 'stater' will be kept, along with a footnote to provide historical context and significance, aligning with the monetary aspect of the passage. I will also emphasize Jesus' authority and the miraculous nature of the event while maintaining a formal tone in the translation. I will ensure that any explanatory commentary remains clearly separate from the text to uphold the literal integrity of the translation.|
