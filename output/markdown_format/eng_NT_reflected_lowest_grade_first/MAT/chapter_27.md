|:---------:|-------|-------------------|
|MAT 27:1|As morning dawned, all the chief priests and the elders of the people took counsel against Jesus to put Him to death.|This verse describes the pivotal moment when the chief priests and elders convened to conspire against Jesus. The use of 'morning' (πρωΐας) signifies the early hours of the day when such a serious meeting could take place, highlighting the urgency and determination of the authorities to act against Jesus. The terms 'chief priests' and 'elders' reflect the Jewish leadership structure of the time, showing their united front against Jesus.|
|MAT 27:2|And after binding Him, they led Him away and handed Him over to Pontius Pilate, the governor.|The phrase 'and having bound Him' signifies the act of restraint before leading someone away. 'Delivered' carries a connotation of betrayal or surrendering someone to authority, which is significant in the context of Jesus' trial and condemnation. 'Pontius Pilate' is referred to as the governor, emphasizing his political power and role in the trial of Jesus.|
|MAT 27:3|Then Judas, who had betrayed Him, seeing that He was condemned, was filled with remorse and returned the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and the elders.|To enhance clarity and emotional depth while remaining faithful to the original text, I will revise the phrasing of MAT 27:3. I will ensure that the translation communicates Judas's sense of guilt and turmoil without reverting to the term 'regretted.' Instead, I will emphasize his feeling of repentance, connecting it to his actions clearly. I'll also keep the phrase 'the one who had betrayed Him' for clarity. The structure will be adjusted for smoother flow, while preserving the literal fidelity to the Greek source. Lastly, I will ensure the cause-and-effect relationship between Judas's realization and his actions is clearly conveyed.|

You see to it.'|In updating MAT 27:4, I will focus on enhancing Judas's emotional expression to capture his remorse more vividly, reflecting his guilt over betraying Jesus. Additionally, I will revise the response of the chief priests to convey a dismissive tone, highlighting their indifference to Judas's confession.

Lastly, I'll include a contextual note to provide deeper insight into the significance of this moment in the narrative.|
|MAT 27:5|And casting the silver coins in the temple, he went away and hanged himself.|To satisfy the correction requirements, I will maintain a literal translation while ensuring clarity and emotional nuance in the context of Judas's actions. I will focus on direct language and improve sentence structure to enhance readability. It's also important to ensure the mention of 'in the temple' is clear, given its significance. I will avoid phrases commonly found in other translations to ensure originality.|
|MAT 27:6|But the chief priests took the silver coins and said, 'It is not lawful to put these into the treasury, since it is the price of blood.'|In this verse, the priests express their moral dilemma regarding the acceptance of the blood money from Judas, emphasizing the concept of sacredness associated with the temple and the weight of the blood shed. The term 'Corban' is used in the context of an offering to God, highlighting their reluctance to treat the money as ordinary currency.|
|MAT 27:7|And after taking counsel, they bought the potter's field with the silver, for a burial place for strangers.|The objective is to enhance the clarity and fidelity of the translation of MAT 27:7. By substituting 'with the silver' for 'with those funds', we maintain a closer adherence to the original language. Additionally, refining the phrase regarding the purpose of the land to 'for a burial place for strangers' enhances both precision and clarity. The overall goal is to achieve a formal and accessible biblical translation that is both accurate and reader-friendly.|

This means avoiding phrases that summarize or explain the significance of the field, focusing solely on what the text explicitly states.|
|MAT 27:9|Then was fulfilled what was spoken through the prophet Jeremiah, saying: 'And they took the thirty pieces of silver, the price of Him who was valued, whom they valued from among the sons of Israel.'|To create an updated translation for MAT 27:9, I will ensure that it is a literal translation while also improving readability. I will adjust phrases for clarity, such as changing 'the price of the valued one' to a more precise term that captures the meaning of the original Greek. Additionally, I will keep direct references to 'the prophet Jeremiah' for contextual clarity and smooth phrasing. Overall, the goal is to maintain the integrity of the original text while making it accessible to modern readers.|
|MAT 27:10|And they delivered these into the potter's field, as the Lord commanded me.|To improve MAT 27:10, I will implement the following changes: 1) Replace 'gave' with 'delivered' to enhance the formal tone; 2) Include the word 'these' to refer explicitly to the thirty pieces of silver for clarity; 3) Make minor adjustments to the phrasing to improve overall readability while ensuring fidelity to the original text; 4) Maintain the theological significance in the phrase 'as the Lord commanded me' to highlight its importance; 5) Consider adding a footnote to explain the fulfillment of prophecy for additional context.

The overall goal is to create a translation that is accessible and aligns with conservative Christian interpretations.|
|MAT 27:12|And to the accusations made against Him by the chief priests and the elders, He did not answer a single word.|To revise MAT 27:12 effectively, I will focus on enhancing literal precision, adopting a more formal tone, and emphasizing the depth of Jesus' silence. The suggested phrase 'He did not answer a single word' will better reflect the Greek text's meaning and convey a sense of complete silence. Additionally, I will streamline the introductory clause for clarity, thereby maintaining the solemn tone that the context demands.|
|MAT 27:13|Then Pilate said to Him, 'Do you not hear how many things they testify against you?'|In order to create a faithful and readable translation of MAT 27:13, I will maintain accuracy to the original Greek while also improving the fluidity of the phrase. I will consider the context of Pilate's question and make adjustments to ensure clarity without being overly formal or archaic. I will choose not to capitalize the pronouns for consistency, focusing instead on making the translation accessible to modern readers while retaining a biblical tone.|
|MAT 27:14|And He did not respond to him with a single word, and the governor was greatly astonished.|In updating Matthew 27:14, I focused on simplifying the language for clarity and improving the flow of the sentence while staying true to the original Greek text.

I also verified that no previously removed content or phrasing was introduced.|
|MAT 27:15|Now during the feast, it was customary for the governor to release to the people one prisoner of their choice.|To enhance the fluency and readability of the translation, I will refine the sentence structure while preserving the formal tone necessary for scripture. Additionally, I will keep the term 'feast' to reflect the cultural context of the original text and adjust phrasing to improve flow. My goal is to ensure clarity without losing the reverence expected in biblical translation.|
|MAT 27:16|Then there was a well-known prisoner named Barabbas.|In reviewing the current translation of MAT 27:16, I've noted the feedback regarding the term 'notorious.' While it accurately reflects Barabbas's infamy, I agree that using a more neutral term like 'well-known' could provide a less biased tone, aligning better with the overall narrative. Additionally, rephrasing the sentence to enhance clarity is important, so I will opt for 'Then there was a well-known prisoner named Barabbas.' This not only maintains the original meaning but also improves the sentence flow.|
|MAT 27:17|So when they had gathered together, Pilate said to them, 'Whom do you want me to release to you? Barabbas or Jesus, who is called the Christ?'|This verse depicts a critical moment where Pilate offers the crowd a choice between Jesus and Barabbas, highlighting the theme of choice and accountability in the narrative of Jesus' trial. The use of the name 'Barabbas' is significant as it contrasts with Jesus, whose title 'the Christ' emphasizes His messianic identity.|
|MAT 27:18|For he knew that it was out of envy that they had delivered Him over.|In light of the peer review feedback, I will maintain fidelity to the original Greek while enhancing the clarity and flow of the English translation. I will emphasize the significance of 'envy' as it relates to the betrayal of Jesus, providing additional context that aligns with conservative Christian perspectives. The goal is to ensure that the updated translation reads smoothly while preserving the essential meaning of the text.|
|MAT 27:19|As he sat on the judgment seat, his wife sent him a message, saying, 'Have nothing to do with the Righteous One, for today I have suffered greatly in a dream because of Him.'|To enhance clarity and fluidity, I will adjust the phrasing slightly to ensure that it reads smoothly for contemporary audiences while remaining faithful to the Greek text. I will substitute 'that Righteous Man' with 'the Righteous One' to increase theological precision and explicitly reference Jesus. Additionally, I will add an emphasis on the urgency of Pilate's wife's warning by using stronger language. Finally, I will plan to include a footnote explaining the significance of the term 'Righteous One' and the implications of the warning from Pilate's wife to provide deeper cultural context for readers.|
|MAT 27:20|But the chief priests and the elders persuaded the crowds to demand Barabbas and to condemn Jesus to death.|To revise MAT 27:20, I will prioritize refining the language to better reflect the serious nature of the actions described in the original text. By replacing 'destroy' with 'condemn to death' or 'put to death', I will enhance the gravity of the statement, aligning it more closely with the original Greek meaning. Additionally, I'll emphasize the mob mentality by using 'demand' to indicate the crowd's active participation in calling for Barabbas' release and Jesus' condemnation. I will ensure that the revised translation remains faithful to the source while avoiding any resemblance to existing translations.|
|MAT 27:21|The governor replied to them, 'Which of the two do you want me to release to you?' They said, 'Barabbas.'|In revising MAT 27:21, I will implement the corrections by enhancing clarity and flow in the dialogue. I will change 'Whom of the two' to 'Which of the two' to align with standard English phrasing while maintaining a formal tone. I will also simplify 'the governor responded to them, saying,' to improve readability without sacrificing the scripture's dignity. Additionally, I will include a brief contextual note about Barabbas to emphasize the narrative's significance. Lastly, I will ensure consistency in terminology by sticking to 'governor,' as it fits within the conservative Christian context.|
|MAT 27:22|Pilate said to them, 'What then shall I do with Jesus who is called Christ?' They all answered, 'Let Him be crucified!'|In this verse, the term 'the one called Christ' highlights the identity of Jesus that is being questioned. The response 'Let Him be crucified' reflects the intense rejection and condemnation faced by Jesus from the crowd. The use of direct speech emphasizes the collective will of the people.|
|MAT 27:23|But the governor asked, 'What wrong has He done?' And they shouted all the more, 'Let Him be crucified!'|In addressing the peer reviews of MAT 27:23, it is essential to enhance the emotional intensity of Pilate's question while maintaining a literal translation that remains faithful to the Greek text. I will also aim for improved readability by considering variations in phrasing. Moreover, consistency in the translation of key terms throughout the context will be upheld. The emotional gravity of the scene, where Pilate questions the crowd in disbelief about Jesus' alleged wrongdoing, needs to be captured effectively.|
|MAT 27:24|When Pilate saw that he was getting nowhere, but rather that the crowd was becoming more tumultuous, he took water and washed his hands before the crowd, saying, 'I am innocent of the blood of this righteous man; you yourselves are responsible for it.'|To improve MAT 27:24, I will clarify the accountability of the crowd regarding Jesus' blood by rephrasing the closing statement.

The changes will include simplifying phrases and selecting more common alternatives for specific terms. This approach will enhance the readability of the translation without losing its original meaning. My final translation will be carefully crafted to reflect these considerations.|
|MAT 27:27|Then the soldiers of the governor took Jesus into the praetorium and gathered the whole battalion against Him.|In this verse, the term 'the whole battalion' emphasizes the mocking and brutal treatment of Jesus by the soldiers. The Greek word 'στρατιῶται' indicates a military context, which is maintained here for accuracy. The 'praetorium' is understood as the governor's official residence, further establishing the authority under which these events are occurring.

The corrections provided guide the choice of words and structure to emphasize the mockery Jesus faced. I will replace 'when they had finished mocking Him' with 'after they had mocked Him' for a more direct translation, and I will use 'clothed Him in His own garments' instead of 'robed Him in His garments' for clarity. Consistency in terminology will be maintained by ensuring 'scarlet robe' is consistently used. Overall, the adjustments aim to preserve the original sequence and emphasize the gravity of the actions taking place, while also enhancing readability.|
|MAT 27:32|As they were going out, they came upon a man of Cyrene named Simon; they compelled him to carry His cross.|To update Matthew 27:32 while adhering to the correction guidelines, I will keep the word 'compelled' as it accurately reflects the original Greek and the context of Simon being forced to carry Jesus' cross. I will use 'encountered' to convey active involvement but will also consider 'came upon' for a potentially smoother reading. I will maintain the original sentence structure as much as possible for literal fidelity but will rearrange phrases for improved clarity.

The term 'gall' will be used to accurately represent the Greek term, and I'll consider phrasings that enhance clarity. Additionally, I will avoid any theological commentary and adhere to the goal of a faithful translation. Thus, I will refine the phrasing to be more direct while keeping it as literal as possible.|

(Psalm 22:18)|To improve MAT 27:35, I will explicitly mention that 'garments' refer to Jesus' clothing to avoid ambiguity. I will enhance the connection to the prophecy being fulfilled, integrating it directly into the translation instead of leaving it as a footnote.

The term 'accusation' is employed to emphasize the charge placed against Jesus, aligning with the context of His trial and crucifixion. The phrase 'This is Jesus, the King of the Jews' retains the formal proclamation of His identity, reflecting the gravity of the moment.|
|MAT 27:38|Then there were two robbers crucified with Him, one on the right and one on the left.|In revising Matthew 27:38, the goal is to improve the fidelity of the translation by using 'robbers' instead of 'thieves', as this term more accurately conveys the meaning of 'λῃσταί'.

This approach will keep the translation clear and aligned with biblical styles while ensuring it remains distinct from existing translations.|

|MAT 27:46|About the ninth hour, Jesus cried out with a loud voice, saying, "My God, My God, why have You forsaken Me?" (Transliteration: "Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani?")  

*Contextual Note: This profound cry from Jesus reflects His deep sense of forsakenness as He bears the weight of humanity's sin, echoing the lament of Psalm 22:1.

The phrase 'Evening having come' is rephrased to 'When evening had come' to better fit English language conventions. The mention of Joseph's discipleship is repositioned to the beginning of the sentence for clearer context and flow. This helps the reader understand Joseph's identity and relationship with Jesus immediately. The translation will still emphasize his wealth, thus keeping the term 'rich man' but ensuring the sentence flows naturally.

This term holds significant meaning in Jewish burial customs, reflecting honor and respect for the deceased. The action of wrapping the body demonstrates Joseph's care and devotion in preparing Jesus for burial.|
|MAT 27:60|and laid it in his own new tomb, which he had hewn out of the rock. And he rolled a large stone to the entrance of the tomb and went away.|The current translation of MAT 27:60 is accurate and faithful to the Greek text. The strengths of clarity and reverence are acknowledged, but improvements can be made in word choice for better impact. Changing 'great stone' to 'large stone' might convey the size and importance of the stone in the narrative more effectively. A slight rephrasing for flow while keeping it literal is also considered. Overall, the goal is to enhance readability and maintain a deep theological significance.|
|MAT 27:61|And there were Mary Magdalene and the other Mary sitting opposite the tomb.|In this verse, we observe the presence of Mary Magdalene and another Mary sitting opposite the tomb. The choice of 'sitting' conveys a sense of mourning and vigilance, as they were there to witness the aftermath of the crucifixion and the burial of Jesus.|
|MAT 27:62|The next day, which is after the Preparation, the chief priests and the Pharisees gathered together before Pilate.|In this verse, the reference to 'the day after' aligns with the Jewish understanding of time, where days begin at sunset. The term 'the preparation' signifies the day before the Sabbath, which is significant in the context of the Passover and the urgency of the events following Jesus’ crucifixion. This translation maintains the nuances of the original Greek text while ensuring clarity in English.|
|MAT 27:63|saying, 'Sir, we remember that this deceiver said, ‘After three days I will rise.’|To enhance the translation of MAT 27:63, I will focus on conveying the disdain expressed by the Jewish leaders towards Jesus. By using 'this deceiver' instead of 'this one who leads astray', I can align the translation more closely with traditional interpretations. Additionally, I will ensure that the overall structure remains faithful to the Greek text while making it clear to modern readers what the intent of the original text was. This will help maintain a balance between clarity and fidelity to the source material, and accurately reflect the context of the passage.|
|MAT 27:64|Therefore, command that the tomb be secured until the third day, lest His disciples come by night and steal Him away and say to the people, 'He has risen from the dead.' For the last deception would be worse than the first.|In translating MAT 27:64, I will ensure fidelity to the original Greek text while making the meaning clear and accessible in English. The term 'secure' will be used to convey the idea of making the tomb safe against theft, and 'guard' will refer to the soldiers appointed for this purpose. I will rephrase the last part about the deception to ensure clarity and theological accuracy. I'll also emphasize the urgency felt by the chief priests, maintaining their sense of fear about the potential for deception. Minor grammatical adjustments will improve readability without sacrificing the literal aspect of the translation.|
|MAT 27:65|Pilate said to them, "You have a guard; go, secure it as you know how."|In this translation task, I aim to improve the accuracy and authority of Pilate's statement in MAT 27:65. The suggested corrections require a more literal adherence to the Greek while maintaining a formal and commanding tone. I'll replace 'as best as you can' with 'as you know how' to reflect the original meaning more closely. Additionally, changing 'You have the guard' to 'You have a guard' emphasizes the singular nature of the term in the Greek. I also need to ensure the language conveys the urgency and authority in Pilate's command, as this was a critical moment regarding the security of Jesus' tomb.|
|MAT 27:66|So they went and secured the tomb, sealing the stone with the guard.|To ensure the updated translation of MAT 27:66 is more literal and faithful to the original Greek text, I will focus on refining the phrase structure while maintaining clarity and consistency with surrounding verses. The phrase 'sealing the stone with the guard stationed there' will be revised to 'sealing the stone with the guard', emphasizing the action without unnecessary detail. This will enhance the authoritative tone of the passage, making it clearer and more coherent in the context of the narrative. I will retain key terms like 'secured' and 'sealing' to convey the actions taken by the chief priests and Pharisees accurately. The aim is to achieve a balance between a literal translation and readability without veering off into cultural or historical commentary.|
