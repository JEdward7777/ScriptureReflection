|MAT 14:1|At that time, Herod the tetrarch heard reports about Jesus.|In this verse, the term 'tetrarch' refers to Herod Antipas, who ruled over a fourth part of the territory.

The term 'ἀκοὴν' signifies a report or rumor, emphasizing the significance of Jesus’ fame during this time.|
|MAT 14:2|And he said to his servants, "This is John the Baptist; he has been raised from the dead, for this reason the powers are at work in him."|To create an updated translation for Matthew 14:2 that is faithful to the original Greek text while considering the provided corrections, I will maintain the original Greek syntax, clarify Herod's misunderstanding regarding John's resurrection, adopt a more formal tone, and simplify certain phrases. This will help create a translation that aligns with conservative interpretations while enhancing clarity and literal accuracy.|
|MAT 14:3|For Herod had arrested John and bound him in prison because of Herodias, his brother Philip's wife.|This verse details the actions of Herod regarding John the Baptist, emphasizing Herod's authority and the reason for John's imprisonment, highlighting Herodias' involvement. The translation aims to maintain the integrity of the original Greek while making it accessible in English.|
|MAT 14:4|For John had been telling him, 'It is not lawful for you to have her.'|This verse emphasizes John's admonition against Herod's unlawful relationship with Herodias, which is significant in the context of the moral teachings found throughout the New Testament. The phrase 'it is not lawful for you' reflects the legal and ethical standards of the time as well as the prophetic role of John in confronting sin.|
|MAT 14:5|And although he wished to put him to death, he feared the crowd, because they held him to be a prophet.|To create an updated translation for MAT 14:5, I will incorporate the suggested language adjustments by substituting 'desired' with 'wished' to make it more relatable. Additionally, I will enhance the phrasing for better fluidity without sacrificing the literal meaning of the original Greek text. I will ensure that Herod's internal conflict and the crowd's regard for John the Baptist as a prophet are clearly conveyed. Lastly, I will include a footnote to elaborate on the significance of the term 'prophet' as it pertains to the context, while also ensuring that the translation remains original and distinct from existing translations.|
|MAT 14:6|But when Herod's birthday was celebrated, the daughter of Herodias danced before them and pleased Herod.|This verse captures the moment of celebration and entertainment that is juxtaposed with the serious events occurring in the background. The word 'danced' is significant as it sets the scene of a feast and points to Herod's character and moral decline. The term 'pleased' implies a deeper connection to Herod's desires and the atmosphere surrounding the event.|
|MAT 14:7|Therefore, he swore to her with a solemn oath, saying, 'Whatever you ask of me, I will give to you, up to half my kingdom.'|To enhance the translation of MAT 14:7, I will focus on the solemnity of Herod's oath while maintaining a literal and faithful representation of the original Greek text. I will consider using terms that emphasize the weight of the promise made by Herod and ensure the phrase flows well for readability. Additionally, I will strive to maintain a respectful tone suitable for a conservative Christian audience.|
|MAT 14:8|But she, having been urged on by her mother, said, 'Give me here on a platter the head of John the Baptist.'|This verse illustrates the intense influence of Herodias over her daughter and the bold request for John's head.

|MAT 14:9|And the king was deeply distressed; but because of his oaths and his guests, he commanded that it be given to her immediately.|In revising MAT 14:9, the focus will be on enriching the emotional expression by selecting words that convey deeper feelings of sorrow or distress. The command's urgency will be emphasized by rephrasing the last part to reflect the immediacy of Herod's order. Clarity will be enhanced by specifying 'his guests' instead of a more convoluted phrase. Additionally, adjustments will be made to improve the overall flow of the sentence without losing the essence of the original text.|
|MAT 14:10|So he sent and had John beheaded in the prison.|In this verse, the act of sending someone to behead John signifies not only the brutality of Herod but also the culmination of a series of moral failings and political pressures he faced. The term 'executioner' captures the nature of the command issued by Herod, emphasizing the weight of his decision, influenced by public opinion and personal oath.|
|MAT 14:11|And his head was brought on a platter and given to the girl, and she brought it to her mother.|I will focus on creating a literal translation of Matthew 14:11 that remains true to the original Greek text without adding any commentary or subjective interpretations. The goal is to convey the meaning directly as it appears in the source text.|
|MAT 14:12|And his disciples approached and took the body and buried it; and they informed Jesus.|To enhance the clarity and gravity of MAT 14:12 while adhering to the correction guidelines, I will rephrase 'they reported to Jesus' as 'they informed Jesus' to provide a clearer and more formal tone.

Additionally, I will ensure the translation aligns with traditional biblical tones while maintaining fluidity. Minor structural adjustments will be made for improved readability without altering the original meaning.|
|MAT 14:13|When Jesus heard about it, He withdrew from there by ship to a solitary place alone. But when the crowds heard of it, they followed Him on foot from the cities.|In re-evaluating Matthew 14:13, I will incorporate the corrections provided. I will change 'boat' to 'ship' to align with traditional biblical terminology. Furthermore, I will replace 'desolate place' with 'solitary place' to enhance the understanding of Jesus's need for solitude, which is a crucial aspect of the passage. I will also reposition 'by Himself' to emphasize the significance of Jesus's solitude. Finally, I will clarify the phrase regarding the crowds to indicate their source more precisely.|
|MAT 14:14|And when Jesus went out, He saw a great crowd, and He was moved with compassion for them and healed their sick ones.|To ensure clarity and reverence in the translation, I'll replace 'immense throng' with 'great crowd' for better understanding. I will change 'stepping forth' to 'went out,' maintaining a sense of traditional language. The phrase 'moved with compassion' will remain unchanged, as it effectively captures Jesus's emotional response. I will also slightly modify 'healed their sick' to 'healed their sick ones' to reflect Jesus's divine authority while still being clear and faithful to the original text. These changes aim to enhance readability and theological nuance without infringing on existing translations.|

The revisions emphasize clarity, urgency, and a formal tone that aligns with a conservative Christian perspective.

|MAT 14:17|The disciples replied to Him, 'We have here only five loaves and two fish.'|To achieve a translation that is both literal and accessible, I will replace 'possess' with 'have' to simplify the expression. The word 'only' will be maintained to highlight the disciples' limited resources. I will ensure the disciples are clearly identified to maintain clarity while keeping the emotional nuance of their perceived inadequacy in mind. I'll strive for a more readable construction without straying from the original text's meaning.|
|MAT 14:18|He said, 'Bring them here to me.'|The phrase 'Bring them here to me' emphasizes Jesus' request for the disciples to present the loaves and fish, signifying His power to perform miracles with the little they had.|
|MAT 14:19|And He commanded the crowds to recline on the grass; taking the five loaves and the two fish, He looked up to heaven and blessed them, and having broken the loaves, He gave them to His disciples, and the disciples distributed them to the crowds.|To refine the translation of MAT 14:19, I will focus on enhancing clarity while ensuring the literal fidelity of the text. I will adjust the phrase 'breaking the loaves' to a more accurate term that reflects the original Greek while maintaining the emphasis on Jesus' divine authority when He looks up to heaven. The flow of the sentence will be improved with minor grammatical adjustments and natural word order changes, ensuring the passage is both readable and reflective of the original intent. This includes maintaining the integrity of the verbs used, particularly around the actions of blessing and distributing. The overall goal is to provide a translation that is precise and faithful to the source without added interpretations.|
|MAT 14:20|And all ate and were filled, and they took up the leftover fragments, twelve baskets full.|To address the peer reviews effectively, I will ensure that the translation of MAT 14:20 remains as literal as possible, reflecting the original Greek wording while incorporating slight variations for clarity. I will specifically consider using 'filled' in place of 'satisfied' to maintain consistency with the original term. Additionally, I will use 'leftover fragments' instead of 'leftover pieces' to enhance precision. I will also aim to convey the dual meaning of satisfaction without introducing interpretative phrases that could detract from the literal translation objective. This balanced approach will ensure that the translation remains faithful to the original text while considering theological nuances where appropriate.|
|MAT 14:21|And those eating were about five thousand men, apart from women and children.|For MAT 14:21, I will ensure a literal translation that reflects the original Greek accurately while maintaining clarity and fluidity. The phrase 'those eating' will replace any more interpretative language to preserve the meaning of 'ἐσθίοντες'. Additionally, I'll keep the structure straightforward to allow for an understanding of the significance of the crowd's size within the context of the miracle, potentially addressed through external footnotes. I will also ensure that the translation maintains originality and does not resemble other known translations too closely.|
|MAT 14:22|And immediately, Jesus urged His disciples to embark on the boat and go ahead of Him to the other side of the lake, while He dismissed the crowds.|To revise MAT 14:22, I will maintain the strength of the current translation while enhancing readability and biblical formality. I will consider replacing 'compelled' with 'urged' to improve fluidity. Additionally, I will clarify the destination by specifying 'to the other side of the lake' to provide context. These adjustments aim to maintain fidelity to the original Greek while improving the translation's accessibility and understanding for readers, especially from a conservative Christian perspective.|

I will emphasize the purpose of Jesus' action by explicitly mentioning that He went up the mountain to pray. Adjusting 'when evening had come' to 'and when evening had come' will improve the flow while remaining faithful to the structure of the original Greek. I will replace 'the crowds' with 'the multitude' to resonate with traditional biblical language. The tone will remain reverent and clear to cater to both conservative Christian readers and modern audiences, enhancing readability without losing the original meaning.|
|MAT 14:24|But the boat was in the middle of the sea, tossed by the waves, for the wind was contrary to them.|To translate MAT 14:24 more literally while enhancing accessibility and clarity, I will revise certain phrases to maintain a formal tone. The phrase 'the wind was against them' will be changed to 'the wind was contrary' to reflect a more precise translation. I will simplify 'already in the middle of the sea' to just 'in the middle of the sea' for fluidity, ensuring the sentence remains readable and coherent.

The term 'phantasm' denotes their belief that what they saw was an apparition, revealing their fear and misunderstanding in that moment.|
|MAT 14:27|But immediately Jesus spoke to them, saying, 'Take courage! I AM; do not be afraid.' [See footnote on the significance of 'I AM' in Exodus 3:14]|To refine the translation of MAT 14:27, I will adjust the phrase 'Be of good cheer!' to 'Take courage!' or 'Take heart!' to better align with traditional translations while still being faithful to the original text. Additionally, I will keep the note on the significance of 'I AM' as it highlights important theological implications related to God's self-identification in Exodus 3:14. This adjustment will help enhance reader understanding while maintaining the essence of the original meaning.|

And having descended from the boat, Peter walked on the water to go to Jesus.|In updating MAT 14:29, I will apply the suggested refinements to enhance clarity and fluency while preserving the literal translation's integrity. I will replace 'having come down from the boat' with 'having descended from the boat' to adhere more closely to the Greek structure.

I'll focus on rephrasing 'when he saw the strong wind' to 'seeing the strong wind' to adhere more closely to the Greek structure. I will choose 'became afraid' to capture the emotional response Peter experiences more vividly. 'As he began to sink' will replace 'beginning to sink' for better flow. To maintain urgency in Peter's plea, I will retain 'Lord, save me!' and ensure that the punctuation adds to the emotional depth of the plea. The overall translation will aim to reflect both the literal text and the intended emotional impact, making it accessible to modern readers.|
|MAT 14:31|Immediately, Jesus stretched out His hand and seized him, saying, 'O you of little faith! Why did you doubt?'|In revising MAT 14:31, I will ensure that the translation accurately reflects the original Greek terms.

Finally, I will perform a quality assurance check to ensure that the translation aligns with a conservative Christian perspective and is accessible to modern readers.|
|MAT 14:32|And when the disciples entered the boat, the wind immediately calmed.|The main focus is to enhance the clarity and theological depth of the translation for Matthew 14:32. By clearly stating 'the disciples' as the subject, I eliminate any potential ambiguity. Modifying the phrase regarding the wind will not only improve the formal tone but also preserve the immediacy of the event. The inclusion of a brief contextual note on the significance of the miracle underlines Jesus' authority, which is central to the passage. While making language adjustments, I will ensure that the miraculous nature of the event is retained, and the updated translation remains faithful to the source.|
|MAT 14:33|Then those who were in the boat came and worshiped Him, saying, 'Truly, You are the Son of God.'|In this verse, the disciples, after witnessing the miraculous calming of the sea and recognizing Jesus' divine authority, respond with worship. The phrase 'truly you are the Son of God' emphasizes their acknowledgment of His true identity and divinity. The word 'worship' (προσεκύνησαν) indicates a profound reverence and recognition of His divine status, mirroring similar instances in scripture where figures acknowledge God's sovereignty.|
|MAT 14:34|After they had crossed over, they arrived at the land of Gennesaret.|The phrase 'land of Gennesaret' refers to a region located near the western shore of the Sea of Galilee, known for its fertile land and abundant produce. This verse marks a transition in the narrative as Jesus arrives in a new location after the miraculous events that preceded it.|
|MAT 14:35|And when those men of that place identified Him, they sent word throughout the whole region, and they brought to Him all who were suffering.|To enhance the translation of Matthew 14:35 while maintaining fidelity to the original text, I will adopt a more fluid and clear English phrasing. I will replace 'the men of that place' with 'those men' for improved readability. I will also modify 'all who were afflicted' to a term that conveys a deeper understanding of their suffering, such as 'all who were suffering.' Additionally, I will consider using 'recognized Him' as 'identified Him' to provide a more nuanced understanding of their perception. This approach will help to achieve a translation that is both faithful and accessible without plagiarizing existing translations.|
|MAT 14:36|And they implored Him that they might only touch the fringe of His garment. And as many as touched it were made perfectly whole.|The term "fringe" or "hem" refers to the tassels worn on the corners of garments as part of Jewish law (Numbers 15:38-39). This touch signifies faith and the belief in Jesus’ healing power. The phrase "those who touched" indicates a collective act of faith, leading to their healing.|
