| Reference | Verse | Translation Notes |
|:---------:|-------|-------------------|
|MAT 15:1|Then the scribes and Pharisees who had come from Jerusalem approached Jesus, saying:|In revising Matthew 15:1, I will maintain a formal tone by omitting unnecessary phrases that detract from the authoritative nature of scripture. I will also provide clarity by specifying the roles of the scribes and Pharisees as religious leaders challenging Jesus. To improve the flow, I will refine the wording while keeping a literal translation. Finally, I will aim to reflect the urgency of the confrontation to emphasize the challenge presented by these leaders. Overall, these adjustments should enhance the understanding and readability of the verse without compromising its literal integrity.|
|MAT 15:2|Why do Your disciples break the tradition of the elders? For they do not wash their hands when they eat bread.|This verse emphasizes the conflict between Jesus and the Pharisees regarding the observance of traditions, particularly those concerning ceremonial cleanliness. The use of 'tradition' and the reference to 'elders' highlights the authoritative weight such practices held among the Jewish leaders, contrasting with Jesus' teachings and actions.|
|MAT 15:3|But He answered them, "And why do you also transgress the commandment of God because of your tradition?"|To enhance clarity and readability, I will rephrase the translation while maintaining the literal meaning of the original Greek text. The word choice will be evaluated to ensure it resonates with both traditional and contemporary audiences. I will emphasize the theological contrast between God's commandments and human traditions clearly. The aim is to preserve the essence of the message without plagiarizing other translations.|
|MAT 15:4|For God commanded, saying, 'Honor your father and your mother'; and, 'Whoever speaks ill of his father or mother shall surely be put to death.'|In revising MAT 15:4, I will aim to balance a literal translation with clarity for modern readers. I'll keep the original meaning intact, ensuring that the seriousness of God's command is emphasized while avoiding potential copyright issues. This involves rephrasing the verse while retaining its theological weight. I will focus on making the structure smooth for contemporary understanding without losing the intent of the original Greek text.|
|MAT 15:5|But you say, 'Whoever says to his father or mother, "If you have received any advantage from me, it is a gift," does not honor his father or mother.'|To address the correction objectives, I will revise the phrase for clarity, opting for 'If you have received any advantage from me' to emphasize the expectation of honoring parents. I'll clarify the condemnation of this action by stressing that not honoring one's parents is a direct violation of God's commandment. Additionally, I will include a contextual note regarding the cultural significance of 'gift' and parental obligations, enhancing understanding of the consequences of these actions. The structure will be adjusted for better readability while maintaining the literal sense of the original Greek text.|
|MAT 15:6|And you have made void the commandment of God by your tradition.|In reviewing Matthew 15:6, I will implement the suggestions from the peer review to improve clarity and accuracy while maintaining a literal translation approach. I will replace 'Thus' with 'And' to ensure smoother continuity from the previous verse, and I will enhance the contrast between God's command and human tradition. This will be accomplished by rearranging the sentence structure to emphasize the active role of the Pharisees in nullifying God's command. The revised translation will be: 'And you have made void the commandment of God by your tradition.' This modification adheres to the intent of the original text while satisfying the need for clarity and precision.|
|MAT 15:7|Hypocrites! Isaiah prophesied well about you, saying:|This translation reflects the admonition of Jesus toward the Pharisees, emphasizing their pretense and the fulfillment of prophecy by Isaiah. The term 'hypocrites' conveys a strong rebuke regarding their insincerity in worship.|
|MAT 15:8|"This people draws near to Me with their mouth and honors Me with their lips, but their heart is far from Me."|The task requires a literal translation that aligns closely with the original Greek text while also adhering to conservative Christian principles, such as maintaining proper capitalization when referring to God or Jesus. Adjusting word choices will improve the clarity and emphasize the subject matter. The specific suggestions include changing 'far removed from me' to 'far from Me' to reflect a more direct interpretation, and improving the flow of the phrase 'This people honors Me with their lips'. Therefore, the final translation for MAT 15:8 will be adjusted accordingly.|
|MAT 15:9|But they worship Me in vain, teaching as doctrines the precepts of men.|To enhance the translation of MAT 15:9 while adhering to the corrections provided, I will focus on improving readability and flow without losing the original meaning. I will refine the phrases for clarity, ensuring they resonate with modern readers while remaining faithful to the source text. The updated translation will also maintain a formal tone appropriate for biblical scripture. I will pay particular attention to the terms 'commandments of men' and 'doctrines' to make sure they convey the intended theological implications effectively.|
|MAT 15:10|And calling the crowd, He said to them, "Listen and understand!"|In revising MAT 15:10, I will focus on producing a literal translation that faithfully reflects the original Greek text. The phrase 'Listen and understand' will be retained to capture the essence of Jesus' message, while ensuring that the wording is accessible and straightforward. I'll replace any complex terms with simpler alternatives, emphasizing urgency in Jesus' call to attention. Furthermore, I will aim for uniqueness in phrasing to avoid overlap with existing translations while still staying true to the meaning conveyed in the original scripture.|
|MAT 15:11|"It is not what enters the mouth that defiles a person, but rather what comes out of the mouth; this is what makes a person unclean."|To ensure the translation of MAT 15:11 is consistent and faithful to the source text, I will adopt the term 'defiles' consistently. I will adjust the phrasing to enhance clarity and fluidity while avoiding redundancy. Additionally, I will emphasize the connection to the heart, highlighting the theological significance of internal motivations versus external actions. Care will be taken to rephrase the sentence to maintain originality and avoid plagiarism while still aligning with conservative Christian perspectives on the verse.|
|MAT 15:12|Then His disciples approached Him and said, 'Do You know that the Pharisees were offended when they heard this saying?'|To revise MAT 15:12, I will implement the suggested word choice changes to better reflect the Greek term 'ἐσκανδαλίσθησαν.' This will enhance clarity for a conservative audience, as it captures the moral outrage of the Pharisees more effectively. I will also restructure the sentence slightly for improved readability, while ensuring it remains original. Additionally, I will provide contextual clarity on why the Pharisees were offended, highlighting their role in the narrative and the significance of their reaction.|
|MAT 15:13|But He replied, 'Every plant that my heavenly Father has not planted will certainly be uprooted.'|For the translation of MAT 15:13, I will ensure that the phrasing is both faithful to the original Greek text and fluid in English. I will also emphasize the finality of God's authority over what He has not planted, thus clarifying the consequences of false teachings. Additionally, I will consider the spiritual implications of this statement by possibly including a footnote or commentary. This will help the reader to grasp the depth of Jesus' warning about false leaders. Overall, I will strive for a balance between literal accuracy and readability while adhering to a conservative Christian perspective.|
|MAT 15:14|"Leave them alone; they are blind leaders of the blind. And if a blind man leads another blind man, both will fall into a pit."|To achieve the goals outlined in the correction, I will focus on maintaining terminology consistency by using 'leaders' instead of 'guides'. I'll also enhance clarity and readability by refining the phrasing while ensuring it remains literal. To emphasize the metaphorical implications of 'blind leaders', I will consider incorporating footnotes that explain the spiritual blindness and the resulting consequences of such leadership. Furthermore, I'll aim for a style that is both formal and accessible to modern readers, stressing the seriousness of following 'blind leaders'. This approach should capture the intended message while satisfying the requested adjustments.|
|MAT 15:15|Then Peter, responding, said to Him, "Explain to us this parable."|To address the instructions, I will replace 'interpret' with 'explain' to more clearly reflect Peter's intent. The term 'parable' will remain to ensure consistency with the original text, but I will consider how this fits within the overall context of Jesus' teachings. Additionally, I will revise the structure for clarity and smoothness in English while ensuring formal equivalence and fidelity to the original text. Cultural context will be subtly integrated by framing Peter's request as a desire for deeper understanding in a teaching moment. This approach will enhance clarity and readability while keeping the authoritative nature of the scripture.|
|MAT 15:16|But Jesus said, "Are you also without understanding?"|To enhance the tone of Jesus' statement in MAT 15:16, I will replace 'dull' with a phrase that communicates a sense of urgency while remaining reverent. The alternative phrases suggested help soften the initial wording and reflect the emotional weight of His inquiry. I will maintain a literal translation approach, ensuring faithfulness to the original Greek while being careful not to introduce too much interpretation that could stray from its intended meaning. This reflects the rhetorical questioning by Jesus and aligns with a conservative theological interpretation, emphasizing the call for understanding among His followers.|
|MAT 15:17|Do you not yet understand that whatever enters the mouth goes into the stomach and is eliminated?|This verse emphasizes the distinction between external physical actions and the internal condition of the heart. It suggests that what enters the body through eating is not what defiles a person; rather, it is the state of one’s heart and intentions that matter. The context shows a teaching on purity and what is truly important in a believer's life.|
|MAT 15:18|But what comes out of the mouth proceeds from the heart, and this is what defiles a person.|This verse emphasizes the importance of the heart's intentions, showing that what emerges from a person's heart is what defiles them. It suggests a deeper moral and spiritual understanding of purity.|
|MAT 15:19|For out of the heart come evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, fornications, thefts, false testimonies, and blasphemies.|To provide an updated translation for MAT 15:19, I will incorporate the term 'fornications' instead of 'sexual immoralities' to maintain fidelity to the original Greek word 'πορνεῖαι'. I will ensure that the overall language is clear and reflective of traditional biblical terminology. Furthermore, I will aim to enhance the flow of the sentence to improve readability while preserving the formal tone expected in biblical translations. This will allow the text to resonate with the intended audience while remaining faithful to the source material.|
|MAT 15:20|"These are the things that defile a person; but eating with unwashed hands does not defile him." [Footnote: In Jewish tradition, handwashing before meals is a significant ritual that symbolizes purity. However, Jesus emphasizes that spiritual defilement comes from within, rather than from external practices.]|In addressing the provided corrections for Matthew 15:20, I will ensure to use 'defile' consistently throughout the translation for theological alignment. I will also simplify the phrase regarding eating with unwashed hands for clarity while maintaining a formal tone to reflect the seriousness of the scripture. Additionally, I will add a brief footnote to explain the cultural context surrounding the act of handwashing in Jewish tradition, enhancing reader understanding without detracting from the primary translation. Finally, I will ensure the language flows well to improve readability while staying faithful to the original Greek text.|
|MAT 15:21|And Jesus departed from there and withdrew to the regions of Tyre and Sidon.|In this translation, 'departed' conveys the action of leaving a place, similar to the original Greek. 'Withdrew' and 'region' provide clarity in the modern context, ensuring the geographical significance of Tyre and Sidon is maintained. The text captures the essence of Jesus’ movement and his ministry's geographical boundaries without deviating from the scriptural integrity.|
|MAT 15:22|And behold, a Canaanite woman from those regions came out and cried out to him, saying, "Have mercy on me, Lord, Son of David; my daughter is severely tormented by a demon."|In this verse, the term 'Canaanite woman' reflects her ethnic background, while the plea for mercy emphasizes her desperation and recognition of Jesus as the Messiah, termed here as 'Son of David'. The phrase 'my daughter is severely demon-possessed' highlights both her anguish and the severity of her daughter's condition, indicating the urgent need for intervention.|
|MAT 15:23|But He did not answer her a word. And His disciples came and urged Him, saying, "Send her away, for she cries out after us."|In this verse, the response of Jesus to the woman's cry is significant, illustrating a moment of silence in the face of urgent plea, which is often interpreted as a test of faith. The use of 'he did not answer her a word' indicates not only a physical silence but a deeper spiritual context, where understanding and revelation may not come immediately.|
|MAT 15:24|But He answered and said, "I was sent only to the lost sheep of the house of Israel."|In this verse, Jesus emphasizes His primary mission to the lost sheep of Israel. The term 'lost' refers to those who are spiritually lost and in need of guidance and salvation. This reflects the broader theme of Jesus' ministry aimed at the Jewish people, while foreshadowing the eventual expansion of His message to all nations.|
|MAT 15:25|But she came and worshiped Him, kneeling down, saying, "Lord, please help me!"|To enhance the translation of MAT 15:25, I will adjust the wording to capture the emotional intensity and urgency of the Canaanite woman's plea. This involves using a more evocative expression of 'help me!' and clarifying the act of kneeling as an act of worship. The revised translation will focus on conveying her desperation and humility, aligning with the overall objective of remaining faithful to the source text while improving emotional resonance.|
|MAT 15:26|But He answered, "It is not good to take the bread of the children and give it to the little dogs." [Footnote: The term 'little dogs' refers to domesticated pets, which illustrates the Jewish view of the Gentiles. In this context, Jesus' response serves to highlight the priority of His mission to Israel while also demonstrating the woman's remarkable faith, which transcends cultural boundaries.]|I will address the corrections by expanding the footnote to clarify the cultural significance of 'little dogs' in the context of Jesus' response to the Canaanite woman. I will also adjust the phrasing from 'to throw it to the little dogs' to 'to give it to the little dogs' for neutrality and clarity. Additionally, I will refine the language for better readability while keeping the meaning intact. Lastly, I will ensure that the footnote remains concise and relevant, enhancing understanding without overwhelming the text.|
|MAT 15:27|But she said, 'Yes, Lord; even the dogs eat the crumbs that fall from their masters' table.' [Footnote: The term 'dogs' in this context refers to domesticated animals, highlighting the woman's humble acknowledgment of her status in relation to the Jewish audience while reflecting her remarkable faith. In Jewish culture, dogs were considered unclean animals, yet the woman's response indicates her understanding of Jesus' mission and her desperation for help.]|In refining the translation of MAT 15:27, I will focus on enhancing clarity and structure, maintaining cultural nuances, and ensuring fidelity to the original Greek text. I will adjust the phrasing to include 'the crumbs' for clarity and consider using 'dogs' instead of 'puppies' to preserve the gravity of the statement while still acknowledging the cultural context. The footnote will be enhanced with additional details on cultural implications without overshadowing the translation itself. Overall, the aim is to achieve a balance between literal translation and accessibility, reflecting the serious nature of the exchange between Jesus and the Canaanite woman.|
|MAT 15:28|Then Jesus answered her, 'O woman, great is your faith! Let it be done for you as you desire.' And her daughter was healed from that very hour.|In this passage, Jesus recognizes the great faith of the woman and responds to her plea. The phrase 'as you wish' reflects His willingness to grant her request based on her faith. The term 'daughter' is an affectionate reference that conveys care and acceptance. The healing takes place at that very moment, demonstrating Jesus' power and authority over illness.|
|MAT 15:29|And moving on from there, Jesus came by the Sea of Galilee, and after going up onto the mountain, He sat down there.|In this verse, Jesus transitions from a location to another near the Sea of Galilee and then ascends a mountain to sit down, which is significant as it indicates His role as a teacher and leader, often symbolized by elevated places. The words used in this verse reflect themes of movement, geographical features, and the posture of sitting as a sign of authority in teaching.|
|MAT 15:30|And great crowds came to Him, bringing with them the lame, the blind, the mute, the crippled, and many others; and they laid them down at Jesus’ feet, and He healed them.|The translation captures the essence of the original text by maintaining the specific conditions of the people who approached Jesus and emphasizing His miraculous healing. The choice of words like 'came to Him,' 'crippled,' 'blind,' and 'many others' reflects the severity of their conditions and the urgency of their need for healing. The phrase 'cast them at the feet of Jesus' highlights their desperation and faith in His power to heal.|
|MAT 15:31|So the crowds were amazed, seeing the mute speaking, the crippled restored, the lame walking, and the blind seeing; and they glorified the God of Israel.|To revise MAT 15:31 while considering the corrections, I will aim to enhance clarity, maintain tense consistency, avoid interpretative language, and ensure fluidity in the English text. The goal is to communicate the miraculous nature of Jesus' actions and the crowds' response without added interpretations. I will use simpler language where necessary while still being faithful to the original text. The focus will remain on the miraculous events and the glorification of God by the crowds, reflecting the significance of these actions in the context of the narrative.|
|MAT 15:32|Then Jesus called His disciples to Him and said, 'I feel deep compassion for this crowd, for they have been with Me for three days and have nothing to eat. I do not want to send them away hungry, lest they faint on the journey.'|The phrase 'I have compassion' is translated from 'σπλαγχνίζομαι', which emphasizes a deep emotional response. The urgency of their need for food is highlighted by the context of having been with Him for three days. This translation aims to retain the depth of feeling expressed by Jesus while making it clear to modern readers.|
|MAT 15:33|And His disciples said to Him, 'From where could we possibly find enough bread in this wilderness to satisfy such a large multitude?' [Footnote: This question reveals the disciples' struggle to understand Jesus' ability to provide in dire circumstances, reflecting their journey of faith and reliance on His power amidst their doubts. Despite having witnessed His previous miracles, they remain uncertain about how to meet the needs of the crowd in such a desolate place.]|In translating MAT 15:33, the focus is on creating a translation that is both literal and accessible, preserving the meaning of the text while incorporating traditional biblical language. Enhancing the footnote to provide more context about the disciples' relationship with Jesus will offer insights into their journey of faith, particularly in moments of doubt such as this. The goal is to reflect the incredulity of the disciples in a wilderness setting while maintaining clarity and readability for a conservative Christian audience.|
|MAT 15:34|And Jesus said to them, 'How many loaves do you have?' They said, 'Seven, and a few small fish.'|To enhance the translation of MAT 15:34 while maintaining a literal approach, I will retain the original terms for 'loaves' and 'fish,' as they effectively convey the meaning of the source text. However, to better align with the Greek syntax and structure, I will adjust the phrasing for 'small fish' to emphasize its literalness. This will involve rephrasing it as 'few small fish,' which preserves the original context while improving readability and adherence to a conservative interpretation.|
|MAT 15:35|And He commanded the crowds to recline on the ground. [Footnote: Reclining during meals in the cultural context of the time symbolized a communal gathering, where individuals shared not just food, but fellowship and community. This act illustrates Jesus’ desire to bring the crowd into a shared experience, highlighting the importance of togetherness in His ministry.]|To update the translation of MAT 15:35, I will keep the original phrase 'And He commanded the crowds to recline on the ground' since it closely mirrors the original Greek and captures the authoritative action of Jesus. However, I will also consider the alternative phrase 'to sit down' to enhance contemporary comprehension while ensuring faithfulness to the text. Additionally, I will expand the footnote to elaborate on the cultural significance of reclining at meals, emphasizing the communal aspect and how it reflects shared experiences among the people during this moment. Finally, I will ensure that the sentence structure is clear and flows well for the reader.|
|MAT 15:36|And having taken the seven loaves and the fish, He blessed them, broke them, and gave them to His disciples; and the disciples distributed them to the crowds. [Footnote: This act of blessing emphasizes the miraculous nature of Jesus' provision, showcasing His divine authority and compassion as He meets the needs of the people.]|1. Maintain consistency in terminology by using 'loaves' for 'bread' and 'fish' as the same throughout the translation.  
2. Replace 'after taking' with 'having taken' to enhance the fluidity of the phrasing.  
3. Place additional emphasis on the miraculous nature of Jesus' actions by highlighting His blessing and the outcome of the distribution.  
4. Ensure footnotes are informative but focused on theological significance without overly subjective interpretations.  
5. Aim for clarity and avoid redundancy, ensuring the revised verse communicates effectively without repetitive terms.|
|MAT 15:37|And they all ate and were satisfied, and they took up the leftover fragments, seven baskets full. [Footnote: The gathering of seven baskets full signifies the abundance of God's provision through Jesus, reflecting His compassion for the people and the miraculous nature of the meal, highlighting His divine authority in meeting their needs. The number seven often symbolizes completeness in biblical texts.]|To address the peer reviews for Matthew 15:37, I will ensure that the translation remains faithful to the original Greek text while enhancing clarity and contextual understanding. This includes providing a footnote that emphasizes the miraculous nature of the event and its implications, particularly focusing on Jesus' divine authority and the significance of the leftover baskets. I will retain the current translation's language choices as they have been positively reviewed, ensuring that any additional insights do not conflict with the translation itself.|
|MAT 15:38|Now those who ate were four thousand men, besides women and children.|The term 'four thousand men' is noted as distinct from women and children, emphasizing the count of the men alone, indicative of the larger multitude present. The phrase illustrates the significance of the feeding miracles that Jesus performed, providing context to the gathering of followers.|
|MAT 15:39|And He sent the crowds away, He entered the boat and went to the region of Magdala. [Footnote: Magdala, known for its fishing industry, was a notable location on the western shore of the Sea of Galilee and reflects the continued ministry of Jesus in the region.]|To improve the clarity and readability of the translation, I will simplify the phrasing of MAT 15:39 while maintaining the essence and literal meaning of the original text. The phrase 'And having sent away the crowds' will be adjusted to 'He sent the crowds away' for better flow. Additionally, I will incorporate a concise footnote regarding Magdala, highlighting its significance without excessive detail. I will ensure that the translation remains faithful to the original Greek, specifically focusing on phrasing that captures the literal meaning while keeping a formal yet accessible tone. Finally, I will aim to connect this verse smoothly to the preceding narrative by considering the context of Jesus' ministry and movements.|
