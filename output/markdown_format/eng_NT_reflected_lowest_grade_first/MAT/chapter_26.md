In refining the syntax, I will focus on using familiar phrasing that resonates with the emotional weight of the moment. The goal is to deliver a translation that is faithful to the original text but accessible for modern readers.|

I will aim for a balance that captures the intent of the scripture and makes it accessible to the target audience.|
|MAT 26:42|Again, He went away a second time and prayed, saying, 'My Father, if this cup cannot pass from Me unless I drink it, let Your will be done.'|This verse reflects the deep emotional turmoil of Jesus as He faces the impending crucifixion. The language emphasizes His human struggle with the divine will, highlighting the dual nature of Christ—fully divine yet fully human. The use of 'cup' symbolizes the suffering He was about to endure, and the phrase 'Your will be done' underscores the theme of obedience to God's plan.|
|MAT 26:43|And coming back, He found them again sleeping; for their eyes were heavy.|The verse highlights the disciples' inability to remain awake and alert during a critical moment, emphasizing their spiritual lethargy. The phrase 'their eyes were heavy' reflects a state of physical exhaustion which also carries a metaphorical weight, indicating a lack of spiritual vigilance.|
|MAT 26:44|And having left them, He went away again and prayed the same prayer for the third time.|To enhance the translation of MAT 26:44, I will focus on increasing the accuracy and clarity of the wording while maintaining a faithful representation of the original Greek text.

|MAT 26:46|'Get up! Let us go; behold, the betrayer is near.'|To refine the translation of MAT 26:46, I will implement the suggested corrections to enhance clarity, urgency, and conciseness. I will revise 'let us arise' to 'let us go' to reflect a more immediate action. Additionally, simplifying 'Rise, let us arise;' to 'Get up!' adds directness and maintains urgency. I will change 'the one who betrays me' to 'the betrayer' for conciseness. For emotional resonance, I will keep 'behold' instead of simplifying to 'see' to retain a formal biblical tone. This revised translation aims to strike a balance between formal language and accessibility while remaining faithful to the source text.|

The solemnity of the moment is highlighted by emphasizing Jesus' silence in the translation.|
|MAT 26:64|Jesus said to him, 'You have said it. However, I say to you, from now on you will see the Son of Man seated at the right hand of the Power of God and coming on the clouds of heaven.'|In this task, I will focus on creating a more literal translation of Matthew 26:64 that aligns closely with the original Greek while ensuring clarity and theological accuracy.

Additionally, I will maintain the phrase 'Son of Man' as consistent with traditional interpretations and explore wording adjustments to emphasize the weight of Jesus' declaration. The goal is to produce a translation that is not only faithful to the source text but also clear in its implications for the readers.|

The context of a trial is significant, and this adjustment aligns the translation more closely with the scenario of a legal judgment. These changes aim to enhance understanding while maintaining fidelity to the original Greek text.|
|MAT 26:67|Then they spat upon His face, struck Him with blows, and others slapped Him.|To enhance clarity and flow, the translation should incorporate more vivid language to depict the gravity of the scene. The actions will be clearly distinguished, and formal language will be maintained to reflect the serious nature of the event. The aim is to preserve the reverence for Jesus while providing an accurate and respectful account of the events that transpired.|
|MAT 26:68|saying, "Prophesy to us, Christ!

|MAT 26:70|But he denied it in front of them all, saying, "I do not know what you are saying."|In translating MAT 26:70, I need to consider the nuances of the Greek language while ensuring that the English rendering is clear and accurate. The phrase 'I do not know what you say' should be revised to 'I do not know what you are saying' for better clarity.

Overall, the translation must be both literal and readable, maintaining fidelity to the original text while using modern language.|
|MAT 26:71|As he went out to the gateway, another servant girl saw him and said to those nearby, 'This man was surely with Jesus of Nazareth.'|In addressing the corrections for Matthew 26:71, I will replace 'maid' with 'servant girl' to align with the conservative biblical terminology and enhance relatability. To capture the emotional weight of Peter's denial, I will refine the phrase 'was indeed' to 'was surely' which conveys certainty while maintaining formality. I will also ensure that the overall tone reflects the seriousness of the passage, using a more formal expression. The focus will remain on literal accuracy, ensuring that the translation resonates with modern readers without deviating from the original Greek intent.|

I will replace 'curse himself' with 'call down curses upon himself' for better understanding. I will simplify 'swore an oath' to just 'swore' while maintaining its original meaning. Additionally, I will adjust the phrase 'I do not know him!' to 'I do not know the man!' to increase fidelity.
