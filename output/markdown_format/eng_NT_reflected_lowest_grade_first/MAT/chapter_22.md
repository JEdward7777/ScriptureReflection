| Reference | Verse | Translation Notes |
|:---------:|-------|-------------------|
|MAT 22:1|And Jesus answered and spoke to them again in parables, saying:|The phrase 'He answered and spoke to them again in parables' signifies a continued teaching method that Jesus employed to reveal spiritual truths through relatable stories. The repetition of His speaking emphasizes His persistence and the importance of understanding His message, which often remained veiled to many.|
|MAT 22:2|The kingdom of heaven is like a king who prepared a wedding feast for his son.|In this verse, the imagery of a king organizing a wedding for his son illustrates the grandeur and importance of the kingdom of heaven. The word 'king' signifies authority and governance, while 'wedding' denotes joy and celebration, themes frequently associated with divine fellowship.|
|MAT 22:3|And he sent his servants to call those invited to the wedding feast, but they were not willing to come.|In revising MAT 22:3, I will focus on clarity and formal tone while ensuring that the translation remains original. The phrase 'the called ones' will be replaced with 'those invited' for clearer understanding. Furthermore, changing 'but they refused to come' to 'but they were not willing to come' adds a subtle nuance of unwillingness rather than outright refusal. The emotional aspect of the invitation will be subtly enhanced by the phrasing adjustments. Overall, the translation will maintain a formal tone consistent with traditional biblical language.|
|MAT 22:4|Again he sent other servants, saying, 'Behold, I have prepared my marriage supper; my oxen and the fatted calf are slaughtered, and everything is ready. Come to the marriage supper!'|To create an updated translation for MAT 22:4, I will make the following adjustments based on the correction guidelines: 1. I will replace 'wedding feast' with 'marriage supper' for formality and tradition; 2. I will ensure that 'fatted calf' is used consistently; 3. I will rephrase 'all things are ready' to 'everything is ready' for clarity; 4. I will keep the urgency of the invitation by using 'Behold.' Overall, I aim for a literal translation that maintains the theological significance of God's invitation to His people.|
|MAT 22:5|But they disregarded the invitation and went away, one to his own farm and another to his trade.|To enhance MAT 22:5, I will substitute 'ignored' with 'neglected' to better align with the Greek term 'ἀμελήσαντες.' This choice reflects a stronger sense of disregard and emphasizes the guests' refusal to respond to the king's invitation. Additionally, I will reorganize the sentence structure to improve flow, presenting the actions of the guests in a coherent manner. The new translation will also highlight the contrast between the generous invitation and the guests' rejection, thus underscoring the theological implications of the parable. Finally, I will refine the phrasing for literary quality while maintaining a literal translation approach.|
|MAT 22:6|But the others seized his servants, mistreated them, and killed them.|To revise MAT 22:6, I will simplify the translation by using 'his servants' to maintain continuity with previous verses and make it clearer for readers. I will opt for 'mistreated' as it conveys the severity of the actions without being overly harsh. Additionally, I will ensure the translation remains straightforward while providing slight contextual commentary on the significance of the verse, which highlights the rejection faced by God's messengers and reflects a broader theme of ungratefulness and consequences in the parable.|
|MAT 22:7|But when the king heard this, he became enraged. He sent his forces to destroy the murderers and set their city on fire.|In addressing the instructions, I need to enhance the readability of MAT 22:7 by breaking up the long sentence into clearer segments. I'll focus on emphasizing the king's intense emotional response to the actions of the murderers while maintaining a faithful representation of the original Greek text. I will replace 'armies' with 'forces' to better reflect the royal authority, and I will simplify the phrase to 'the murderers' for clarity. These changes should result in a translation that is direct, urgent, and still true to the source material.|
|MAT 22:8|Then he said to his servants, 'The wedding feast is ready, but the invited guests were not worthy.'|In translating MAT 22:8, I will focus on maintaining the traditional terminology of 'wedding feast' while also being open to 'wedding banquet' if it improves clarity. Additionally, I will retain 'unworthy' as it fits with traditional interpretations and will make slight adjustments for readability, such as using 'the invited guests.' I will also ensure the translation reflects the concept of worthiness in the context of divine invitation, as emphasized in conservative Christian doctrine. Overall, I aim for a fluid translation that remains faithful to the source text and aligns with previous instructions.|
|MAT 22:9|Go therefore to the intersections of the roads, and invite as many as you find to the wedding feast.|This verse emphasizes the active invitation to those who may not initially be part of the chosen group. The phrase 'on the roads' metaphorically suggests the spreading of the Gospel to all people, akin to other calls to evangelize found throughout Scripture.|
|MAT 22:10|And those servants went out into the streets and gathered all whom they found, both bad and good; and the wedding hall was filled with guests.|This verse reflects the openness of the invitation to the wedding feast, emphasizing the gathering of both the good and the wicked. It highlights the inclusive nature of God's call to salvation, paralleling the theme of the Great Commission and the parables about invitations to the Kingdom of God.|
|MAT 22:11|But when the king entered to observe the guests, he beheld a man not wearing a wedding garment.|To enhance the translation of MAT 22:11 while maintaining a literal approach, I will focus on word choice, context, fluidity, and formal tone. I will replace 'donning' with 'wearing' to improve clarity. Additionally, I will subtly acknowledge the cultural significance of wedding garments in the translation, while ensuring that it does not detract from the primary focus of the verse. The phrasing will be adjusted to improve readability while remaining faithful to the original text, all while upholding a formal tone that is consistent with traditional biblical translations.|
|MAT 22:12|And he said to him, ‘Friend, how did you get in here without wedding clothes?’ And the man was speechless.|The phrase 'friend' (ἑταῖρε) indicates a sense of relationship, yet it's used in a context that challenges the individual’s standing. The expression of being without wedding attire symbolizes unpreparedness or unworthiness, leading to the man’s silence as a response to the king’s inquiry.|
|MAT 22:13|Then the king said to the servants, 'Bind his hands and feet, take him away, and cast him out into the outer darkness; there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.'|To ensure the translation is both faithful to the original Greek and enhances clarity, I will make adjustments as follows: First, I will rephrase 'Bind his feet and hands' to 'Bind his hands and feet' to improve readability. I will also clarify the concept of 'outer darkness' through explanatory footnotes, without adding interpretative commentary into the translation itself. Furthermore, I will replace 'cast' with 'cast out' to emphasize the action taken. Finally, I will strive to communicate the seriousness of the judgment in a direct manner that respects the original text while also providing clear communication for modern readers.|
|MAT 22:14|For many are invited, but few are chosen.|The phrase 'many are called, but few are chosen' captures the concept of divine invitation versus human response. This duality emphasizes the inclusive nature of God's call while recognizing the reality of selective grace. The terms 'called' and 'chosen' highlight the difference between the general invitation to salvation and the specific acknowledgment of those who accept it.|
|MAT 22:15|Then the Pharisees went and conspired to entrap Him in His speech.|To improve the translation of MAT 22:15, I will incorporate the suggestions from the peer review. I will use 'entrap' instead of 'ensnare' for a more formal tone while ensuring that the overall message is clear and accessible. Additionally, I will slightly rephrase the translation for readability, maintaining the literal sense of the original text. Contextual notes will be considered for inclusion, emphasizing the implications of the Pharisees' actions in the larger narrative of Jesus' ministry. Lastly, I will ensure that the translation aligns with conservative Christian values throughout.|
|MAT 22:16|And they sent their disciples to Him, along with the Herodians, saying, 'Teacher, we know that You are true and teach the way of God in truth; for You do not regard the person of men.'|To achieve a clearer and more literal translation of MAT 22:16, I will focus on maintaining the formal tone appropriate for biblical text. I will ensure that the phrase regarding not showing favoritism is accurately reflective of the original Greek, which indicates that Jesus does not regard the person of men. Additionally, I will simplify the language while preserving the formal context of the scripture, using 'Teacher' instead of 'Rabbi' for consistency. Overall, my aim is to enhance clarity, nuance, and readability while staying faithful to the source text.|
|MAT 22:17|Therefore, tell us your opinion: Is it permissible to pay taxes to Caesar, or not?|To enhance the translation of MAT 22:17 while ensuring originality and a nuanced reflection of the gravity of the inquiry, I will avoid direct parallels with existing translations. The phrase structure will be adjusted to maintain a formal tone suitable for the context. By using terms that emphasize the significance of the question, I can convey both clarity and depth. This will satisfy the recommendations of my reviewers while staying faithful to the original Greek text.|
|MAT 22:18|But Jesus, knowing their wickedness, said, 'Why do you test me, you hypocrites?'|I will implement the corrections by adjusting the phrase 'testing me' to 'Why do you test me?' for a more direct translation. I'll also retain the term 'you hypocrites' to reflect traditional interpretations. Additionally, I'll ensure the translation conveys the emotional intensity of Jesus's admonition while keeping a formal biblical tone suitable for conservative audiences. This aligns with the intent of preserving the original text's meaning and weight.|
|MAT 22:19|"Show Me the coin for the tax."|To address the corrections for MAT 22:19, I will implement a more direct phrasing that emphasizes Jesus' authority and urgency. Changing 'Present to Me the coin for the tribute' to 'Show Me the coin for the tax' will enhance clarity and align with modern understanding. The tone will be kept formal while ensuring the sentence structure is simple and direct. Additionally, the term 'tribute' will be replaced with 'tax' to provide contextual clarity. I'll consider including a footnote about the denarius for further historical significance without overcomplicating the main text.|
|MAT 22:20|And He asked them, 'Whose likeness and inscription is this?'|The term 'image' (εἰκὼν) used in this verse reflects the likeness or representation of authority, while 'inscription' (ἐπιγραφή) pertains to the text or mark identifying ownership. This mirrors the theological implications of God's image in humanity as well as the authority of rulers in earthly governance.|
|MAT 22:21|They said to Him, 'Caesar's.' Then He said to them, 'Therefore, render to Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's.'|In response to the feedback on MAT 22:21, I will focus on producing a literal translation that strictly adheres to the original text without additional commentary or interpretive notes. The goal is to present the original meaning clearly and accurately while avoiding any plagiarism from existing translations. This will ensure that the translation remains true to the source material and meets the expectations set forth by my teachers.|
|MAT 22:22|And hearing this, they were astonished; and they left Him and went away.|To create a more readable and concise translation while maintaining fidelity to the original text, I will adjust phrasing for clarity and grammatical flow. Specifically, I will simplify the sentence structure by replacing 'upon hearing this' with 'hearing this' and change 'having left Him' to 'they left Him' for brevity. The word 'astonished' will remain to reflect a conservative understanding of the verse. Additionally, I will opt for 'they went away' to maintain a sense of nuance consistent with other translations. Contextual notes will also enhance understanding without altering the core text.|
|MAT 22:23|On that day, the Sadducees came to Him, those who say there is no resurrection, and they asked Him.|To revise MAT 22:23, I will focus on the corrections provided. Firstly, I'll replace 'approached Him' with 'came to Him' to achieve a more idiomatic expression. Next, I will adjust 'and they questioned Him' to 'and they asked Him' for a more accurate translation of 'ἐπηρώτησαν.' Additionally, I'll consider a nuance that captures the challenging nature of their inquiry. The goal is to maintain a faithful and literal translation that reflects the intent of the original text while ensuring clarity.|
|MAT 22:24|saying, "Teacher, Moses said that if a man dies without children, his brother must marry his brother's wife and raise up seed for his brother."|To create an improved translation of MAT 22:24, I will integrate the suggested corrections. I will use 'raise up seed for his brother' for consistency with biblical terminology, while also clarifying the reference to 'the widow' as 'his brother's wife.' I aim for a formal tone in keeping with traditional translations while ensuring readability for contemporary audiences. The final sentence will maintain the structure of the original Greek text but will be adjusted for clarity.|
|MAT 22:25|There were seven brothers. The first married and died, and having no offspring, he left his wife to his brother.|The focus of the revision for MAT 22:25 is to clarify the meaning of the levirate marriage tradition. The phrase 'entrusted his wife to his brother' is not only slightly ambiguous but does not fully convey the cultural significance of the action. Replacing it with 'left his wife to his brother' is more straightforward and accurately reflects the intent of the law regarding marriage within a family. Additionally, I will ensure the structure remains close to the original Greek while enhancing fluidity and readability for contemporary readers.|
|MAT 22:26|Likewise, the second and the third, until all seven.|To improve the translation of MAT 22:26 while maintaining its literal fidelity, I will replace 'Similarly' with 'Likewise' to enhance formality and align with traditional translations. Additionally, I will include a brief contextual note about the Sadducees' scenario to aid reader understanding. Finally, I will adjust the phrase 'until the seventh' to 'until all seven' for more directness, ensuring that the essence of the original text is preserved. These changes aim to enhance clarity while keeping the translation accurate.|
|MAT 22:27|Finally, after them all, the woman also died.|The phrase 'and the woman' indicates a closure to the story of the seven brothers, emphasizing the finality of death. The focus on the woman's fate after all the brothers died underlines the narrative's concern with life, death, and resurrection, setting up the theological implications that follow in the discourse with Jesus.|
|MAT 22:28|In the resurrection, whose wife will the woman be? For all seven had her as a wife.|In this verse, the Sadducees are questioning the idea of resurrection using a hypothetical situation. The translation seeks to capture the formal inquiry of the Sadducees about the marital status of the woman in the resurrection context, reflecting the nuances of Greek phrasing and the emphasis on 'the seven'.|
|MAT 22:29|"Jesus answered and said to them, 'You are mistaken, not knowing the Scriptures, nor the power of God.'"|To improve the translation of MAT 22:29, I will consider the suggested alternatives to the word 'deceived,' opting for 'mistaken' to convey the message more clearly and theologically accurate. I will restructure the sentence for better alignment with the original Greek, using commas for readability while maintaining formality. Additionally, I will ensure the translation remains faithful to the source text, while possibly including a footnote for readers who might benefit from further context regarding the theological implications of Jesus' statement. Overall, the goal is to enhance clarity and impact without losing fidelity to the original text.|
|MAT 22:30|For in the resurrection, they neither marry nor are given in marriage, but are like angels of God in heaven.|In this verse, Jesus emphasizes the nature of existence after the resurrection, clarifying that relationships, such as marriage, do not exist in the same form as they do on earth. This is a statement about the spiritual state of those who are resurrected, akin to angels.|
|MAT 22:31|Concerning the resurrection of the dead, have you not read what God spoke to you in the Scriptures?|In updating MAT 22:31, I will simplify the phrasing to enhance clarity while emphasizing traditional language that reflects conservative Christian interpretation. The goal is to maintain theological integrity and to ensure the translation uniquely expresses the meaning of the original text. By addressing the context of Jesus' challenge to the Sadducees, I aim to convey the significance of the verse in a way that resonates with a modern audience while respecting scriptural authority.|
|MAT 22:32|"I am the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. God is not the God of the dead, but of the living."|To incorporate the corrections provided, I will start by clarifying the pronouns in the verse to enhance understanding. Changing 'He is' to 'God is' improves clarity regarding the subject being discussed. Next, I will work on the phrasing to ensure it remains smooth and accessible while reflecting the original meaning. I will place special emphasis on the contrast between the living and the dead, as highlighted in the Greek text. I will also ensure the structure stays faithful to the original and adjust punctuation as needed to maintain clarity and readability.|
|MAT 22:33|And when the multitudes heard this, they were astonished at His teaching.|In revising Matthew 22:33, I will implement the suggestions provided in the peer review. I will replace 'the crowds' with 'the multitudes' to reflect a more formal tone and align better with the original text. Additionally, I will choose 'were astonished' as a clearer alternative to 'filled with wonder,' thereby enhancing the impact of the translation. This will ensure that the translation not only remains faithful to the source but also captures the essence of the moment where Jesus' teaching impresses the listeners. Furthermore, I will ensure that the authority of Jesus is maintained in the wording.|
|MAT 22:34|But when the Pharisees heard that He had silenced the Sadducees, they gathered together.|In addressing the translation for MAT 22:34, I will maintain clarity and faithfulness to the source text. I will replace 'forcibly silenced' with 'silenced' to align with the original intent without adding connotations. The phrase 'gathered together in one place' will be simplified to 'gathered together' to improve readability while still conveying the same meaning. I will also enhance the formality of the language to reflect traditional Biblical English. Additionally, I will ensure that the translation remains as literal as possible while keeping it clear and accessible.|
|MAT 22:35|And one of the Pharisees, a lawyer, inquired of Him, intending to test Him, saying,|In this translation, I aim to clarify the identity of 'one of them' as 'one of the Pharisees' to provide a deeper context for the reader. I will replace 'asked Him, saying' with 'inquired, saying...' to enhance fluidity and retain a literal sense. Changing 'scribe' to 'lawyer' aligns better with contemporary understanding while remaining faithful to the original text. I will adopt a more formal phrasing to resonate with the tone of biblical translations and subtly address the motivation behind the lawyer's questioning to reflect the nuance in his inquiry.|
|MAT 22:36|"Teacher, which is the great commandment in the Law?"|I will incorporate the feedback provided for MAT 22:36 to enhance the clarity and formality of the translation. Specifically, I will use 'the great commandment' instead of 'the great one' to reflect the superlative nature of the question. Additionally, I will ensure that the language remains formal and consistent with biblical terminology, aiming for a translation that remains faithful to the original text while improving readability. I will also avoid any enhancements that stray from the original meaning or intent of the verse.|
|MAT 22:37|"Love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your mind."|To address the feedback on MAT 22:37, I will shift the phrasing to reflect a more direct imperative. This not only honors the original Greek intent but also enhances the clarity and readability for contemporary audiences.

Additionally, I will ensure that the translation remains original while adhering to the literal nature of the text.|

It highlights the interconnectedness of divine commandments and prophetic teachings within the context of love.|
|MAT 22:41|While the Pharisees were assembled, Jesus asked them.|To revise MAT 22:41 effectively, I will incorporate the feedback by replacing 'questioned' with 'asked' to soften the tone. I will also simplify 'gathered together' to just 'gathered', while emphasizing the assembly of the Pharisees by potentially using 'assembled'. This will help to clarify the scene and maintain a smooth reading flow. The adjustments will not compromise the original meaning, and will enhance the understanding of the text within its context.|
|MAT 22:42|He asked them, 'What do you think about the Christ? Whose son is he?'

I'll aim to use varied sentence structure to further differentiate this translation from existing ones.|
|MAT 22:44|"The LORD said to my Lord, 'Sit at My right hand until I place Your enemies under Your feet.'"|To translate MAT 22:44 with an emphasis on maintaining the distinct terminology for 'LORD' and 'Lord,' I will use 'LORD' for God (YHWH) and 'my Lord' for Jesus. I will keep the structure close to the original Greek syntax while ensuring clarity and readability. This involves simplifying repetitive phrasing while avoiding plagiarism by altering the wording without changing the meaning. Additionally, I will consider a brief context note to aid understanding for readers who may not be familiar with the significance of this verse within its broader theological context. This verse is pivotal as it reflects on the nature of Jesus as both human and divine, challenging the common understanding of the Messiah's lineage. Lastly, I will refine the flow to enhance readability without compromising theological integrity.|

|MAT 22:46|And no one was able to answer Him a word, nor did anyone dare to question Him anymore from that day forward.|This verse emphasizes the inability of the questioners to respond to Jesus after His probing question about the Messiah's lineage, highlighting the authority of His wisdom. The phrase 'no one dared' underscores the atmosphere of intimidation in the face of His insight and knowledge.|
