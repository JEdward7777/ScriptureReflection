| Reference | Verse | Translation Notes |
|:---------:|-------|-------------------|
|MAT 19:1|Now it came to pass, when Jesus had finished these sayings, He departed from Galilee and went to the borders of Judea, beyond the Jordan.|This verse marks a significant transition in Jesus' ministry as He leaves Galilee and heads towards Judea. The use of 'Galilee' and 'Jordan' provides geographical context, emphasizing the movement and purpose of His journey as He prepares for the events leading to His crucifixion.|
|MAT 19:2|And large crowds followed Him, and He healed them there.|In order to align closely with the instructions provided, I will revise MAT 19:2 by omitting the interpretative phrase 'with immediate effect', using the direct statement 'He healed them there', and opting for 'large crowds' to simplify the translation. This approach maintains a literal translation that reflects the original Greek while improving readability. Additionally, I will ensure that this literalness is maintained in all future translations to avoid any interpretative bias.|
|MAT 19:3|And the Pharisees approached Him, testing Him, and saying, 'Is it lawful for a man to dismiss his wife for any cause?'|To ensure the translation of MAT 19:3 is faithful to the original text while incorporating the requested corrections, I will replace 'permissible' with 'lawful' for accuracy. Additionally, I will change 'tempting' to 'testing' to better reflect the original Greek context of the Pharisees' inquiry. Furthermore, I will modify 'for any reason' to 'for any cause' to align more closely with conservative interpretations of the text regarding divorce. This updated phrasing will retain the literal nature of the translation without introducing ambiguity about the implications of the question asked by the Pharisees.|
|MAT 19:4|He answered them, 'Have you not read that He who created them from the beginning made them male and female,'|This translation aims to preserve the essence of Jesus’ words as He references the creation narrative, emphasizing the intentional design of God for human relationships.|
|MAT 19:5|"For this reason, a man shall leave his father and mother and cleave to his wife, and they become one flesh."|To implement the corrections, I will ensure that I maintain fidelity to the original Greek while incorporating the suggested enhancements for language precision, flow improvement, phrasing enhancement, clarity in terminology, and formality. The primary focus will be on the verb 'κολληθήσεται' to reflect a more traditional biblical phrasing, as well as ensuring the possessive structure regarding 'his wife' is clear. I will also consider the suggested change from 'On account of this' to 'For this reason' for a more literal interpretation. The goal is to create a smooth and respectful translation that aligns with conservative Christian values.|
|MAT 19:6|So they are no longer two, but one flesh. Therefore, what God has joined together, let not man separate.|This translation emphasizes the divine intention behind marriage and the unity it creates, mirroring the original text's focus on the inseparable bond established by God. The phrase 'one flesh' signifies a deep and intimate connection, reinforcing the sacred nature of the marital relationship.|
|MAT 19:7|They said to Him, 'What then did Moses command to give a certificate of divorce and to divorce her?'|In revising Matthew 19:7, the aim is to provide a translation that is both literal and accessible while maintaining the authority of the original text. To achieve this, I will ensure fidelity to the Greek structure but modify phrases for clarity. I will replace 'to dismiss her' with 'and to divorce her' to eliminate ambiguity. The word 'commanded' will be emphasized to reflect the authoritative nature of Moses' directive. I'll also structure the sentence in a way that flows naturally in contemporary English while preserving the formality appropriate for a religious context. Overall, the focus is on enhancing clarity, authority, and fluency without straying from the literal meaning of the text.|
|MAT 19:8|He said to them, 'Moses permitted you to divorce your wives because of the hardness of your hearts; but it was not so from the beginning.'|In this verse, Jesus explains the reason behind Moses' permission for divorce, highlighting that it was due to the hardness of the people's hearts. The phrase 'from the beginning' emphasizes that God's original intent for marriage was different from what Moses allowed later.|
|MAT 19:9|And I say to you, whoever dismisses his wife, except on the ground of sexual immorality, and marries another, commits adultery; and whoever marries a woman who has been dismissed commits adultery.|To create a more literal translation of Matthew 19:9, I will clarify the phrasing regarding the exception for sexual immorality. I'll opt for 'whoever dismisses his wife' instead of 'whoever divorces his wife' to enhance the translation's faithfulness to the original Greek text. I will ensure that the terms used maintain clarity for the reader, particularly the distinction between the act of dismissal and the condition of the person involved. Additionally, the phrasing will be revised to avoid any potential for plagiarism, while still aligning with conservative Christian teachings on marriage and divorce.|
|MAT 19:10|The disciples said to Him, 'If this is the condition regarding a man and his wife, it is better not to marry.'|To revise Matthew 19:10, I will focus on the specified corrections. I will adopt a more formal tone, replacing colloquial terms with more traditional biblical language. Additionally, I will use 'condition' in place of 'situation' to enhance fidelity to the Greek text, while ensuring clarity by simplifying complex phrases. The seriousness of the disciples' response will be emphasized to reflect their astonishment at Jesus' teaching. Thus, the translation will balance faithfulness to the source text with readability and depth.|
|MAT 19:11|But He said to them, 'Not everyone is able to accept this teaching, but only those to whom it has been granted.'|In this translation of MAT 19:11, the focus is on accurately conveying the exclusivity and intent of Jesus' teaching about the difficulty of accepting certain teachings regarding marriage and celibacy. Careful attention will be paid to the terminology used, particularly 'word' or 'teaching', to maintain clarity. The contextual implications will be integrated directly into the verse to enhance understanding without requiring additional footnotes. The language will be adjusted for better fluidity while ensuring the literal meaning is preserved, and unnecessary commentary will be avoided to adhere to a conservative Christian interpretation.|
|MAT 19:12|For there are eunuchs who were born that way from their mother's womb; and there are eunuchs who have been made eunuchs by men; and there are eunuchs who have made themselves eunuchs for the Kingdom of Heaven. He who is able to accept this, let him accept it.|In revising Matthew 19:12, the goal is to maintain the fidelity of the original text while ensuring clarity and engagement for modern readers. I will consistently use the term 'eunuchs' and clarify the different types mentioned. I will simplify phrases for better fluidity without losing the essence. Additionally, I will consider including a note on the spiritual implications of being a eunuch for the Kingdom of Heaven to align with conservative Christian views. This will involve careful word choice to avoid repetition while enhancing overall readability.|
|MAT 19:13|Then little children were brought to Him, so that He might lay His hands on them and pray; but the disciples forbade them.|In re-evaluating Matthew 19:13, it is essential to ensure that the translation reflects a traditional tone while maintaining consistency in terminology and clarity. Changing 'rebuked them' to 'forbade them' aligns with the intent of the disciples' actions in a more authoritative manner, emphasizing their desire to protect Jesus and uphold their views. The capitalization of 'Him' conveys the reverence towards Jesus as upheld in conservative Christian perspectives. The phrase concerning laying hands should reflect the importance of Jesus’ action while remaining faithful to the original text. I will also enhance the emotional context subtly without losing the original meaning, showcasing the significance of Jesus' interaction with children. Therefore, the translation must remain literal yet resonate with traditional interpretations. Overall, the updated translation aims to be reverent, clear, and contextually rich.|

The command to allow children to come to Him suggests a broader principle about openness and receptivity to faith, which can be drawn from the similar themes found in other verses about children.|
|MAT 19:15|And He laid His hands on them and went from there.\n\n*Note: This act signifies Jesus' blessing and care for the children, highlighting their value in the Kingdom of Heaven.|In revising Matthew 19:15, I will focus on ensuring that the translation is both literal and reflective of the original text's meaning. Emphasizing the significance of Jesus' action in blessing the children will be key, while also adjusting the phrasing for improved readability. I'll incorporate a footnote to provide theological insights without cluttering the translation itself. Maintaining terminology consistency with prior translations will help keep the interpretation clear and rooted in traditional understanding. I will keep the main translation straightforward while providing additional insights in the footnotes as necessary.|
|MAT 19:16|And a young man approached Him and said, 'Good Teacher, what must I do to inherit eternal life?'|I will incorporate the feedback to produce an updated translation of MAT 19:16 that emphasizes the term 'Good Teacher' while clarifying the inquiry about eternal life. I will choose to omit 'behold' for better readability and keep 'inherit' to maintain the theological implications associated with eternal life. Additionally, I will add contextual notes for deeper understanding, ensuring the translation aligns with the overall goal of being a faithful, literal rendition of the original text.|
|MAT 19:17|But He said to him, 'Why do you call Me good? Only God is good. If you want to enter into eternal life, observe the commandments.'|The aim is to refine MAT 19:17 by enhancing clarity and readability without straying from the original text's meaning. The proposed changes suggest a more direct phrasing for the nature of goodness and emphasize the need for keeping the commandments, particularly in relation to eternal life. While making these adjustments, it is crucial to avoid closely replicating existing translations to prevent issues of plagiarism. By rephrasing for smoother sentence flow, I can ensure that the theological implications are retained, making the text understandable for a conservative Christian audience.|
|MAT 19:18|He said to him, 'Which ones?' Jesus replied, 'You shall not murder; you shall not commit adultery; you shall not steal; you shall not bear false witness.'|To enhance the translation of MAT 19:18 while incorporating the feedback from peer review, I will maintain a clear dialogue format that emphasizes the conversation between the young man and Jesus. I will adopt a more formal tone by explicitly stating 'You shall' at the beginning of each commandment to reflect authority and traditional biblical phrasing. Additionally, I will ensure that the translation remains faithful to the original Greek while also being original to avoid plagiarism. I will also consider including a brief contextual insight to enhance understanding of the implications of these commandments.|
|MAT 19:19|"Honor your father and your mother, and you shall love your neighbor as yourself." 

*Note: This commandment, as found in Exodus 20:12 and Leviticus 19:18, highlights the importance of family and community relationships in the ethical framework of the Old Testament.|The objective is to create a literal yet accessible translation of MAT 19:19 that adheres to the original Greek text while maintaining clarity. I'll focus on avoiding interpretive insights within the translation and ensuring that it flows well for modern readers. Additionally, a note will be added to explain the significance of the commandments as they relate to their Old Testament roots without altering the translation itself. The translation will reflect the intent to keep it faithful, straightforward, and reflective of the source material without additional commentary.|
|MAT 19:20|The young man said to Him, "These commandments have I observed from my youth; what do I still lack?"|To address the correction, I will focus on enhancing the specificity of the young man's response by changing 'All these things' to 'these commandments'. This improves clarity regarding what he has kept. I will maintain the original phrasing of 'What do I still lack?' as it captures his spiritual inquiry effectively. Furthermore, I will use a more formal tone consistent with traditional biblical language while ensuring readability. Lastly, I will ensure the changes flow naturally without introducing repetition or altering the intended meaning.|
|MAT 19:21|Jesus said to him, 'If you want to be perfect, go, sell your possessions and give to the poor, and you will find treasure in heaven; then, come, follow Me.'

*Footnote: This instruction reflects the radical call of discipleship, emphasizing that true following of Christ may require sacrifice of material wealth, highlighting the contrast between earthly riches and heavenly treasure.|To enhance clarity and readability, I will adjust the phrasing slightly while maintaining a formal tone suitable for scripture. The phrase about the spiritual reward will be emphasized more directly to ensure its significance is clear to the reader. Additionally, I will include a footnote that explains the cultural and historical context of Jesus' instruction about selling possessions and giving to the poor, thereby enriching the reader's understanding and emphasizing the challenge of discipleship in a conservative Christian framework.|
|MAT 19:22|But when the young man heard the words of Jesus, he went away sorrowful, for he had great wealth.|In updating Matthew 19:22, I will incorporate the suggestions provided by the peer review. The main focus will be on enhancing clarity and emotional resonance while adhering to a literal translation.
