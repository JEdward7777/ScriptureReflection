| Reference | Verse | Translation Notes |
|:---------:|-------|-------------------|
|MAT 11:1|Now it came to pass, when Jesus had completed His instructions to the Twelve, that He departed from there to teach and preach in their cities.|In revising Matthew 11:1, I will focus on improving the fluidity and readability of the translation while preserving its literal accuracy. The phrase 'He had completed His instructions to the twelve disciples' offers a clearer and more natural flow in contemporary English. I will retain the phrase 'Now it came to pass' for its narrative importance, while using 'the Twelve' to refer to the disciples concisely and theologically. The terms 'to teach and preach' will better reflect the dual nature of Jesus's mission.|
|MAT 11:2|Now when John the Baptist heard in prison about the works of the Christ, he sent two of his disciples.|This verse emphasizes John the Baptist's awareness of Jesus' ministry while he is imprisoned, highlighting his role as a forerunner and the fulfillment of his mission. The choice of the word 'works' reflects the miracles and teachings of Jesus, which John hears about through his disciples, showing both his faith and his inquiry regarding Jesus' identity as the Messiah.|
|MAT 11:3|John asked Him, 'Are You the One who is to come, or should we look for another?'|To create a translation that is both literal and accessible, I will enhance clarity while maintaining formal language suitable for conservative Christian readers. I will change 'should we expect another?' to 'should we look for another?' to reflect the active expectation present in the Greek text. I will keep 'John asked Him' for contextual accuracy and consider rephrasing the question for better flow and readability. By adjusting 'Art Thou the Coming One?' to 'Are You the One who is to come?', I ensure the title 'the Coming One' is preserved and accurately conveyed without sounding archaic. This aligns with the goal of a conservative translation that remains faithful to the source.|
|MAT 11:4|And Jesus answered them, 'Go and announce to John what you hear and see:'|In revising MAT 11:4, I will prioritize a literal translation that reflects Jesus' authoritative tone and the urgency of His command. I will replace 'report' with 'announce' to better convey the weight of the message being conveyed to John the Baptist. The phrase 'what you hear and see' will be clarified by removing 'that I have done,' making it more direct and focused on the actions themselves without the possessive implication. This aligns with the need to highlight the miracles of Jesus as affirmations of His identity and mission. The revised translation will maintain a respectful tone consistent with conservative Christian values.|
|MAT 11:5|The blind receive their sight, the lame walk, lepers are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead are raised, and the poor have the good news proclaimed to them.|This translation emphasizes the miraculous works of Jesus and their significance as fulfillment of prophecy, particularly the themes of healing and preaching good news to the marginalized.|
|MAT 11:6|And blessed is the one who does not take offense at me.|In this verse, the term 'μακάριός' (blessed) implies a deep sense of happiness or approval from God for those who maintain faith and do not take offense at Christ's ministry. The phrase 'ἐὰν μὴ σκανδαλισθῇ' suggests a temptation to stumble or be offended, which is crucial to understand the blessings tied to unwavering faith in the face of challenges or misunderstandings about Jesus's identity and work.|
|MAT 11:7|As these men were departing, Jesus began to speak to the crowds about John: 'What did you go out into the wilderness to see? A reed shaken by the wind?'|To enhance the clarity and engagement of the translation, I will substitute 'see' for 'behold' while ensuring that the metaphorical nature of the original text is preserved. I will refine the phrasing to maintain a literal structure but also enhance readability. I will ensure that the rhetorical questions posed by Jesus retain their impactful tone, reflecting the sacredness of the scripture in a formal manner. This will help engage the reader more deeply with the text while staying true to the original meaning.|
|MAT 11:8|But what did you go out to see? A man dressed in soft clothing? Look, those who wear soft garments are in the houses of kings.|In revising the translation for MAT 11:8, I will maintain a literal translation to ensure faithfulness to the original text while making slight adjustments for clarity and readability. I will also ensure that the phrasing does not closely resemble existing translations, addressing the issue of copyright. The goal is to present the message effectively in contemporary English, capturing the essence of the verse while avoiding awkward constructions.|
|MAT 11:9|But what did you go out to see? A prophet? Verily I say unto you, and even greater than a prophet.|In revising Matthew 11:9, I will focus on making the phrasing more formal and aligned with traditional translations, such as the King James Version. I will replace 'I tell you' with 'Verily I say unto you' to enhance formality and consistency. Additionally, I will enhance the phrase 'even more than a prophet' to something like 'and even greater than a prophet' to improve clarity while maintaining the original meaning. This approach aligns with the need for clarity and accessibility for contemporary audiences while retaining the theological significance of the verse, particularly regarding John the Baptist's prophetic role.|
|MAT 11:10|For this is the one about whom it is written: 'Behold, I send my messenger before your face, who will prepare your way before you.'|In this verse, Jesus references the prophetic fulfillment of John the Baptist's role as a messenger. The word 'angel' (ἄγγελον) is used in a broader sense here, meaning 'messenger.' The concept of preparing the way signifies making a path clear for the coming of the Lord, emphasizing the importance of John’s ministry in the divine plan of redemption.|
|MAT 11:11|Truly, I tell you, among those born of women, there has not arisen anyone greater than John the Baptist; yet the least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he.|To improve the translation of Matthew 11:11, I will maintain the accuracy and fidelity to the original Greek while enhancing the flow and readability in modern English. The formal tone will be prioritized to reflect the gravity of Scripture. Additionally, I will clarify the relationship between the concepts of greatness and the kingdom of heaven, ensuring that the contrast between John the Baptist and the least in the kingdom is clear and impactful for the reader.|
|MAT 11:12|"From the days of John the Baptist until now, the kingdom of heaven suffers violence, and the violent take it by force."|In updating Matthew 11:12, I need to address the corrections provided by my peers. I will replace the phrase 'those who are eager take hold of it' with 'the violent take it by force,' which aligns more closely with the Greek term 'βιασταὶ' and emphasizes the urgency of the spiritual struggle described. Additionally, I will modify 'the kingdom of heaven is forcefully advancing' to 'the kingdom of heaven suffers violence,' which better conveys the idea of the kingdom facing opposition. I will ensure the language remains clear and accessible to contemporary readers while retaining fidelity to the source text. Commentary will be noted in a footnote for clarity regarding terms like 'suffers violence' and 'the violent.'|
|MAT 11:13|For all the prophets and the Law prophesied until John.|This verse emphasizes the prophetic tradition that existed before John the Baptist, signaling the culmination of prophetic testimony and the fulfillment of the law leading up to the kingdom of heaven being made manifest through Jesus Christ.|
|MAT 11:14|And if you are willing to accept it, he is the Elijah who was to come.|This verse reflects the identification of John the Baptist as the Elijah who was prophesied to come. It emphasizes the role of John in fulfilling Old Testament prophecy, particularly regarding his mission of preparation for the coming of the Lord.|
|MAT 11:15|Whoever has ears to hear, let him hear.|In addressing the suggested corrections for Matthew 11:15, it is essential to balance literal fidelity with the need for clarity and impact. The phrase can be adjusted to enhance urgency while retaining the original meaning. Using a slightly formal tone may also elevate the gravity of the message. Ensuring that the word 'hear' carries spiritual significance is crucial in the context of this verse, making it resonate with conservative Christian perspectives.|
|MAT 11:16|But to what shall I compare this generation? It is like children sitting in the marketplaces and calling out to their companions,|This verse employs a metaphor comparing the generation to children in the marketplace, highlighting their childish behavior and unwillingness to respond to the call of repentance. The term 'children' is used to evoke immaturity and a lack of understanding, which can be contrasted with the expectation of adults.|
|MAT 11:17|'We played a flute for you, and you did not dance; we sang a dirge, and you did not weep.'|In addressing the verse MAT 11:17, I need to make adjustments that reflect the corrections provided. First, I'll change 'pipe' to 'flute' for cultural accuracy, as the flute carries more significance in the context of the Jewish culture and music of the time. Secondly, I will ensure to keep 'did not weep' instead of changing it to 'did not mourn' to retain the emotional weight of the statement. Additionally, I will modify the structure slightly to enhance clarity and readability while preserving the formal tone characteristic of biblical translations. Lastly, I will consider how to note the metaphorical implications of this verse, relating to the audience's rejection of both the joy and sorrow presented by John and Jesus, which enhances their understanding of the message.|
|MAT 11:18|For John came, neither eating nor drinking, and they declare, 'He is possessed by a demon.'|In revising MAT 11:18, I will focus on enhancing the formal tone by using more reverent language, ensuring clarity and readability by simplifying phrases while retaining theological depth, and highlighting the contrast between John and Jesus' lifestyles. I will also incorporate contextual notes to clarify John's asceticism and the societal implications behind the accusations against him. The phrase 'He has a demon' will be examined for cultural relevance and translated in a way that reflects its serious implications in first-century society. Ultimately, I aim to maintain a literal translation that is accessible and resonates with the intended audience, without losing the essence of the original text.|
|MAT 11:19|The Son of Man came eating and drinking, and they say, 'Behold, a man who eats and drinks, a friend of tax collectors and sinners.' Yet wisdom is justified by her children!|In updating MAT 11:19, I focused on several key areas to improve clarity and fidelity to the original Greek text. I prioritized making word choices that align with traditional Christian understanding while also ensuring the language is accessible to modern readers. Specifically, I changed 'vindicated' to 'justified' for better theological clarity, and replaced 'Look' with 'Behold' to invoke a sense of urgency. Additionally, I aimed to streamline the language without losing the cultural context of Jesus’ associations with sinners and tax collectors, as this reflects the societal implications of His ministry. Finally, I ensured that all modifications maintain a conservative Christian perspective and effectively communicate the intent of the passage.|
|MAT 11:20|He began to rebuke the cities in which most of His mighty works were done, because they did not repent.|In translating MAT 11:20, I will begin the sentence with 'He' to clearly identify the subject, enhancing clarity for contemporary readers. I will use 'rebuke' instead of 'reprove' to convey a stronger connotation, while maintaining 'mighty works' for consistency with other translations. Additionally, I will provide context for 'repentance' in a way that aligns with conservative Christian values. I will ensure that the translation remains faithful to the original Greek text while striving for readability, avoiding any overly informal phrases.|
|MAT 11:21|Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! For if the miraculous works done among you had occurred in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes.|To satisfy the emotional weight of the original text, I will keep the phrase 'Woe to you' at the beginning of the verse. This sets a serious tone, emphasizing the gravity of Jesus' rebuke. Next, I will refine the phrasing to improve clarity and flow while ensuring that the miraculous deeds of Jesus are explicitly referenced. I will aim to use straightforward language that conveys the urgency of repentance and the theological implications of their rejection of Jesus' works. The unique phrasing will be crucial to maintaining originality and avoiding any direct mimicry of established translations.|
|MAT 11:22|"But I say to you, it will be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon on the day of judgment than for you."|In revising MAT 11:22, I will implement the suggested changes for accuracy and terminology adjustments. I will replace 'bearable' with 'tolerable' to align more closely with traditional interpretations of biblical texts. I will also adjust the phrase to 'on the day of judgment' to enhance clarity. Furthermore, I will maintain a formal biblical style while ensuring that the translation remains readable and distinct from existing translations. Lastly, I will add a brief contextual explanation to reinforce understanding.|
|MAT 11:23|And you, Capernaum, will you be exalted to heaven? You will be brought down to Hades; for if the miraculous works that were performed in you had been done in Sodom, it would have remained until this day.|To enhance the translation of MAT 11:23, I will focus on refining the phrasing for clarity and readability while remaining true to the original text. I will incorporate 'exalted' instead of 'lifted up' to convey a more natural English expression. Additionally, I will replace 'realm of the dead' with 'Hades' to resonate better with conservative Christian audiences, ensuring it aligns with traditional views of judgment. The translation must also maintain the solemnity and theological significance of Jesus' rebuke to Capernaum, emphasizing the gravity of the message and the call for repentance.|
|MAT 11:24|But I tell you that it will be more tolerable for the land of Sodom on the day of judgment than for you.|In updating Matthew 11:24, I will ensure that the translation remains literal and faithful to the original Greek while enhancing clarity and emphasizing the gravity of the warning regarding judgment. The phrase 'land of Sodom' will be retained for its contextual clarity. To emphasize the contrast between the unrepentant cities and Sodom, I will use strong language that highlights the severity of the judgment. I will also ensure that the structure is clear and engaging for contemporary readers, maintaining originality to avoid plagiarism.|
|MAT 11:25|At that time, Jesus answered and said, 'I praise you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because you have hidden these truths from the wise and discerning, and revealed them to little children.'|To enhance the readability and clarity of Matthew 11:25 while maintaining fidelity to the original Greek, I will focus on alternative phrasing that preserves the meaning but improves flow. Phrases like 'these things' will be retained and clarified to ensure the reader understands what Jesus is referencing. I'll avoid redundancy by choosing more concise terms where applicable, such as opting for either 'wise' or 'discerning' instead of both. Proper punctuation will be used to indicate the structure of the sentence clearly. Additionally, I will consider a footnote that cites the original Greek terms to provide depth and context for scholarly readers. This context will connect to the surrounding verses, emphasizing the significance of the hidden knowledge revealed to 'little children.'|
|MAT 11:26|Yes, Father, for it was your good pleasure to have it this way.|To enhance the translation of Matthew 11:26, I will maintain the original meaning while smoothing out the phrasing for clarity. I will consider the suggestions to rephrase 'to do it this way' in a more traditional manner that reflects the depth of 'ευδοκία' (good pleasure). Additionally, I will ensure that the connection to surrounding verses is made clear, as it relates to God's sovereignty and wisdom in revelation.|
|MAT 11:27|"All things have been entrusted to me by my Father; and no one knows the Son except the Father, nor does anyone know the Father except the Son and whoever the Son wills to reveal Him."|To enhance the clarity and readability of the translation while maintaining fidelity to the original text, I will simplify certain phrases and use more traditional language suitable for a conservative Christian audience. I will also avoid subjective terms to ensure a direct translation. Specifically, I will replace 'sovereignly chooses to reveal Him' with 'wills to reveal Him,' which retains the original meaning while being more straightforward. I will keep the structure intact and ensure theological integrity, providing necessary context through a footnote.|
|MAT 11:28|Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest.|This verse is an invitation from Jesus to those who are weary and burdened, emphasizing His role as a source of rest and relief. The wording is intended to capture the gentle and inviting nature of Christ’s call, stressing that He offers a reprieve from the struggles of life.|

The terms 'gentle' and 'humble' describe His character and emphasize the comfort found in His leadership. The promise of rest for the souls conveys deep spiritual peace and renewal that Jesus offers to those who follow Him.|
|MAT 11:30|For my yoke is gentle, and my burden is light.|In considering the original Greek term 'χρηστός', I will use 'gentle' as it conveys the sense of kindness and approachability of Jesus. The word 'light' can be replaced with 'burden' for better alignment with biblical language, emphasizing the relief from heavy loads that Christ provides. Furthermore, I will connect the relational aspect of Jesus' invitation to the surrounding context, highlighting His compassion and the rest He offers to those who are weary.|
