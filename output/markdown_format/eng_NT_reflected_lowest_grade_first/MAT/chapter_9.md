| Reference | Verse | Translation Notes |
|:---------:|-------|-------------------|
|MAT 9:1|And He got into a boat, crossed over, and arrived at His own city.|In this translation, I chose to use the term 'set sail' to convey the idea of boarding a boat, while 'arrived' signifies the culmination of the journey to His own city. The phrase 'His own city' is used to emphasize the connection between Jesus and the place He returned to, highlighting both a physical location and a sense of belonging.|
|MAT 9:2|And behold, they brought to Him a paralyzed man lying on a bed; and upon seeing their faith, Jesus said to the paralyzed man, 'Take heart, my son; your sins are forgiven you.'|To address the corrections, I will revise the phrasing of Jesus' words to reflect a more formal and compassionate tone, which is more in line with His authority and the gravity of the situation. I will change 'Cheer up, son' to 'Take heart, my son' to convey respect and tenderness. I will also ensure that the translation flows well while retaining key theological concepts such as the forgiveness of sins. Lastly, I will adjust the wording slightly for coherence with other translations while preserving the intended meaning from the Greek text.|
|MAT 9:3|And behold, some of the scribes said among themselves, 'This man is speaking blasphemy.'|The term 'blaspheme' in this verse carries the connotation of speaking irreverently about God or sacred things. The use of 'scribes' suggests the presence of learned individuals who are questioning Jesus's authority and actions, reflecting their role as interpreters of the Law.|
|MAT 9:4|And Jesus, perceiving their thoughts, said, "Why do you harbor evil thoughts in your hearts?"|To enhance the clarity and resonance of MAT 9:4 for a conservative Christian audience, I will use the alternative phrase 'harbor evil thoughts' which captures the original meaning while improving readability. The structure will be adjusted for fluency, ensuring the intent of Jesus' words remains strong. Additionally, I will consider adding a brief contextual note that elaborates on the gravity of the scribes' thoughts, which helps the reader understand the nature of their opposition to Jesus' authority. This approach respects the original Greek text while making it accessible and meaningful without infringing on existing translations.|
|MAT 9:5|Which is easier to say: 'Your sins are forgiven,' or to say: 'Get up and walk'?|To address the corrections, I will focus on preserving a literal translation while enhancing clarity and readability. I will modify the phrase 'What is easier to say' to 'Which is easier to say,' which flows better in English. Additionally, I will subtly highlight Jesus' authority by reinforcing the contrast between forgiveness and healing. This ensures that while the translation remains faithful to the Greek, it also captures the significance of Jesus’ power and authority over both sin and physical ailments without adding interpretive commentary. Original phrasing will be maintained to avoid plagiarism and ensure a unique translation.|
|MAT 9:6|But so that you may understand that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins, He then said to the paralytic, 'Get up, take your mat, and go home.'|The goal is to create a literal and faithful translation of Matthew 9:6 that respects both the original Greek and conservative Christian theology. I will ensure that 'Son of Man' is retained, as it is theologically significant. I'll also rephrase the introductory phrase to enhance clarity while keeping the imperative structure intact for Jesus' command to the paralytic. Additionally, I will choose between 'mat' and 'bed' based on common interpretations while being careful not to plagiarize other translations. After considering these aspects, I will draft an updated translation that addresses all these points effectively.|
|MAT 9:7|And he arose and went to his own house.|In revising the translation of MAT 9:7, I will focus on enhancing the style while retaining accuracy and faithfulness to the original Greek. Taking into account the suggestions from the peer reviews, I will aim for a more traditional tone that is often seen in biblical translations, ensuring it remains plagiarism-free. I will also consider making slight adjustments for better contextual connection without losing the direct meaning of the text.|
|MAT 9:8|But when the crowds saw it, they were filled with awe and glorified God, who had given such authority to men.|In this verse, the crowds are recognizing the divine authority given by God to Jesus, which leads them to worship Him. The term 'authority' reflects the power to perform miracles and healings, and it is vital in understanding Jesus' ministry.|
|MAT 9:9|As Jesus passed by, He saw a man sitting at the tax collector's station, named Matthew, and He said to him, 'Follow Me.' And he arose and followed Him.|In updating Matthew 9:9, I will focus on refining the phrasing to eliminate redundancy, while ensuring that the translation remains literal and faithful to the original Greek text. The use of 'tax collector's station' will be explored to provide clarity on Matthew's role without compromising accuracy. Furthermore, I will enhance the formality of the tone to align with conservative Christian expectations, particularly in the directive from Jesus. Additionally, I will address punctuation to improve readability. Overall, these adjustments will aim to respect the cultural context of tax collectors during Jesus' time while remaining concise in the translation itself.|
|MAT 9:10|And it came to pass, as He was reclining at table in the house, that many tax collectors and sinners came and gathered together with Jesus and His disciples.|To enhance the translation of Matthew 9:10, I will implement the following corrections based on peer review feedback: First, I will use 'and it came to pass' for a smoother introduction that fits the narrative style. I will retain the phrase 'reclining at table' to honor the cultural practices of dining during that period. The term 'συνανέκειντο' will be translated to emphasize the communal aspect of the gathering, reflecting the closeness and interaction of the people present. Additionally, I will ensure that the phrasing remains clear and accessible while respecting the significance of Jesus’ interactions with tax collectors and sinners, aiming for a balance of readability and reverence. I will keep in mind the historical context and conservative values throughout the translation.|
|MAT 9:11|And when the Pharisees saw this, they said to His disciples, 'Why does your Teacher dine with tax collectors and sinners?'|To achieve a literal translation of Matthew 9:11 while enhancing readability and emphasizing context, I will maintain a formal tone. I will replace 'eat with' with 'dine with' to reflect cultural practices. This choice will improve understanding of the social implications and the authority of Jesus. I will ensure that the structure is clear, and I will use consistent terminology throughout the translation to uphold coherence. The emphasis will be on maintaining the meaning while making the text accessible and respectful.|
|MAT 9:12|But when Jesus heard this, He said to them, 'It is not those who are well who need a physician, but those who are sick.'|To create an updated translation of MAT 9:12 that adheres to the correction guidelines, I will enhance the word choice for clarity, opt for a more formal term for 'doctor', and ensure that the contrast between 'healthy' and 'sick' is effectively presented. Additionally, I will make adjustments for fluidity and readability while maintaining the theological intent of the original message. I will ensure the translation is faithful to the source text, preserves the context of the conversation, and aligns with a conservative Christian perspective.|
|MAT 9:13|"Go and learn what this means: 'I desire mercy, not sacrifice.' For I did not come to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance." (See Hosea 6:6)|In revising Matthew 9:13, I will focus on enhancing the clarity and flow of the verse while remaining true to the original Greek structure. The phrase 'Go and understand' will be rephrased to make it more engaging and direct for contemporary readers. I will maintain the literal meaning of 'I desire mercy, not sacrifice' and ensure the citation of Hosea 6:6 is clearly referenced. Additionally, I will consider adding a brief footnote that delves into the theological significance of mercy over sacrifice, thereby enriching the reader's understanding without altering the core translation. Overall, I aim to create a translation that is both accurate and accessible, reflecting conservative Christian values.|
|MAT 9:14|Then the disciples of John came to Him, saying, 'Why do we and the Pharisees fast often, but Your disciples do not fast?'|To fulfill the translation objective, I will focus on creating a literal and clear translation of Matthew 9:14 that captures the essence of the original Greek text without adding any interpretation or modifying the intent. The phrase 'urgently' will be removed to avoid implications about the seriousness of fasting. Instead, the translation will straightforwardly present the question asked by John's disciples, clarifying their fasting practice in contrast to that of Jesus' disciples. This ensures that the translation is faithful and comprehensible.|
|MAT 9:15|And Jesus said to them, 'Can the sons of the bridegroom mourn while the bridegroom is with them? They cannot mourn as long as the bridegroom is with them. The days will come when the bridegroom will be taken away from them, and then they will fast.'|To satisfy the correction requirements, I will replace 'groom' with 'bridegroom' for theological consistency, simplifying phrases for modern clarity. I will also avoid starting the sentence with 'But' and enhance the flow while keeping the emphasis on the joy of Christ's presence. The new translation will ensure that the original Greek meaning is preserved and the structure of the sentence highlights the joy during Christ's time with His disciples before the discussion of fasting arises.|
|MAT 9:16|No one sews a patch of unshrunken cloth onto an old garment; for the patch will pull away from the garment, and a worse tear will result.|The verse emphasizes the incompatibility of old and new, using the metaphor of an old garment and new cloth. The translation aims to convey the original meaning without relying on existing translations, maintaining the essence of the teaching of Jesus about renewal and transformation.|
|MAT 9:17|Neither do they put new wine into old wineskins; otherwise the skins burst, and the wine spills out, and the wineskins are ruined. But they put new wine into new wineskins, and both are preserved.|In this verse, the metaphor of wine and wineskins is used to illustrate the incompatibility of the new teachings of Jesus with the old Jewish traditions. The emphasis is on the need for new containers (or paradigms) to hold the transformative message of the Gospel.|
|MAT 9:18|As He spoke to them, behold, a ruler came and fell at His feet, saying, 'My daughter has just now died; but come and lay Your hand upon her, and she shall be restored to life.'|To enhance the translation of MAT 9:18, I will incorporate the suggested corrections while maintaining fidelity to the source text. I will improve clarity and fluency by using 'As He spoke to them' for the opening phrase and changing 'just' to 'just now' to accurately reflect the timing of the daughter's death. I will also adjust 'will live' to 'shall be restored to life' to convey authority. The phrase 'lay Your hand upon her' will be closely aligned with the original Greek, while the action of the ruler will be modified to 'fell at His feet' to emphasize his urgency and humility. I will keep the term 'ruler' consistent throughout to maintain clarity in the narrative. Overall, these changes aim to reflect the original meaning while improving readability and preserving a formal tone.|
|MAT 9:19|And Jesus arose and followed him, along with his disciples.|In this verse, Jesus' immediate response to the request of the ruler is emphasized by the verb 'followed' (ἠκολούθησεν), which denotes a willing and active following. The inclusion of 'and his disciples' suggests the collective commitment of those who were learning from Jesus. This reflects the early Christian theme of discipleship and the readiness to act in faith when called upon.|
|MAT 9:20|And behold, a woman who had been suffering from a flow of blood for twelve years came up behind Him and touched the hem of His garment.|In refining the translation for MAT 9:20, I will focus on eliminating the interpretative commentary to align with the objective of providing a straightforward, literal translation. The aim is to ensure that the translation reflects the original Greek text without added explanations or commentary, thus improving the flow while remaining close to the source material. The goal is to maintain fidelity to the text and enhance clarity, while also considering slight phrasing adjustments for better readability.|
|MAT 9:21|For she said to herself, 'If I can just touch His garment, I will be healed.'|In this verse, the focus is on the woman's faith and her belief that touching Jesus' garment would bring her healing. The phrase 'if only I touch' emphasizes her desperation and confidence in Jesus' power.|
|MAT 9:22|But Jesus, turning and seeing her, said, "Take heart, Daughter; your faith has saved you." And from that moment, the woman was healed.|I will carefully incorporate the suggested corrections into the translation of MAT 9:22. This involves maintaining the phrase 'your faith has saved you' to reflect both physical and spiritual healing, adjusting 'Be of good cheer' to a more traditional expression such as 'Take heart,' ensuring the capitalization of 'Daughter' is consistent, and keeping the phrase 'and from that moment, the woman was healed' for clarity. I will also consider adding a footnote about the dual meaning of 'saved' to enhance understanding while maintaining the verse's intent.|
|MAT 9:23|And when Jesus arrived at the ruler's house, He saw the flute players and the crowd of mourners, and said to them,|To create an updated translation for MAT 9:23, I will focus on incorporating the provided corrections. First, I'll replace 'observed' with 'saw' to enhance the sense of immediacy. For 'throng of mourners in deep sorrow', I will simplify this to 'crowd of mourners' to maintain emotional clarity while being more straightforward. I'll revise 'addressed them with authority, saying' to 'said to them', which simplifies the phrasing and keeps the focus on Jesus' words. Lastly, I will ensure the translation emphasizes Jesus' authoritative presence and the urgency of the situation, making the flow more natural and engaging for readers.|
|MAT 9:24|"Please leave, for the girl has not died, but sleeps." And they mocked Him.|To enhance the clarity and emotional impact of the verse, I will replace 'derided' with 'mocked' to convey the crowd's scorn more directly. Adjusting the phrasing from 'Depart' to 'Please leave' adds a compassionate tone while maintaining authority. I will rephrase 'but is sleeping' to 'but sleeps' to maintain literal fidelity to the original Greek. Furthermore, I aim to streamline the reaction of the crowd, avoiding redundancy. The final translation should resonate well with a modern audience while staying true to the original text's meaning and intent.|
|MAT 9:25|But when the crowd had been sent away, He went in, took her by the hand, and the maiden arose.|In updating the translation for Matthew 9:25, I will focus on enhancing clarity while maintaining a literal approach to the original Greek text. The suggestions from reviewers will guide my choice of words, especially with the phrase 'put outside' being replaced by 'sent away' to convey a clearer action. Furthermore, substituting 'the girl' with 'the maiden' aims to elevate the formality and fidelity of the translation. I will ensure that the overall message remains intact while aligning with the guidelines for conservative Christian perspectives.|

Additionally, I will specify 'the region of Galilee' to provide geographic context, making the translation more informative. I will ensure the phrasing remains clear and readable while strictly adhering to the original wording without adding interpretive content. Finally, I will keep the translation literal and faithful to the source text, refining it to enhance overall effectiveness and clarity.|
|MAT 9:27|And as Jesus went on from there, two blind men followed Him, crying out, "Have mercy on us, Son of David!"|The verse captures the earnest plea of the two blind men as they acknowledge Jesus’ lineage and authority by calling Him 'Son of David.' The phrase 'have mercy on us' is a common appeal throughout the Scriptures, indicating a deep recognition of need and faith in Jesus’ power to heal.|
|MAT 9:28|And when He entered the house, the blind men approached Him, and Jesus said to them, "Do you believe that I am able to do this?" They answered Him, "Yes, Lord."|In this update for MAT 9:28, I will adjust the phrase from 'perform this miracle' to 'do this' to better align with the literal Greek meaning. This change emphasizes Jesus's direct inquiry regarding His capability without additional interpretative language. I will also ensure that the faith of the blind men is highlighted more clearly in their response, reflecting the urgency and significance of their belief in Jesus's power. Additionally, I will aim for a more formal tone, using traditional biblical language to maintain reverence and clarity. The aim is to ensure that the verse remains distinct in phrasing while also providing a deeper theological understanding without the reliance on footnotes.|

The term 'faith' in this context suggests a deep trust and conviction in Jesus' power to heal.|
|MAT 9:30|And their eyes were opened; and Jesus sternly warned them, saying, "See that no one knows this."|I need to ensure that the translation is both literal and faithful to the original Greek text. This involves retaining the phrase 'their eyes were opened' for clarity and accuracy, as it is crucial for understanding the miraculous act that took place. Changing 'strongly commanded' to 'sternly warned' (or a similar phrase) will help align the tone with other commands of Jesus found in scripture, which often carry a weighty sense of authority. Furthermore, modifying 'this event' to 'this' or 'what has happened' enhances the literalness and directness of the translation. I will avoid interpretative phrases to maintain fidelity to the original text's meaning and structure.|
|MAT 9:31|And when they went out, they spread the word about Him throughout all that land.|To effectively translate MAT 9:31, I will maintain the core meaning of the original text while implementing the suggested corrections.

Additionally, I will ensure the translation reflects an accurate and faithful rendering of the original Greek without infringing on other translations.|
|MAT 9:32|As they were departing, behold, they brought to Him a deaf-mute possessed by a demon.|To enhance the formality and literal translation of Matthew 9:32, I will replace 'look' with 'behold' to elevate the tone of the text. Additionally, I will opt for 'a deaf-mute' to reflect the original Greek terminology more accurately. I will ensure that the phrase 'possessed by a demon' is clearly rendered to maintain the intended meaning from the Greek. The aim is to create a translation that is both faithful to the original text and resonates with conservative audiences, while maintaining consistency with traditional biblical language.|
|MAT 9:33|And when the demon was cast out, the mute spoke; and the crowds were amazed, saying, 'Never has such a thing been seen in Israel!'|In crafting the translation for Matthew 9:33, the goal is to ensure a literal and faithful representation of the original Greek text while also enhancing clarity and reverence. The suggested revisions point towards a more traditional and formal tone, so I will aim to refine phrases for greater impact and adherence to biblical language. Notably, I'll rephrase 'the one who was mute spoke' to 'the mute spoke,' and ensure the phrasing 'Never has such a thing been seen in Israel!' aligns closely with the source structure. Overall, this verse will reflect both fidelity to the original language and an elevated tone suitable for scriptural text.|
|MAT 9:34|But the Pharisees were saying, 'He is casting out demons by the chief of demons.'|To revise Matthew 9:34, I will focus on enhancing the clarity and readability of the verse while ensuring a literal translation. I'll incorporate the correction of 'ruler of demons' to 'chief of demons' to align more closely with the Greek text and reflect the seriousness of the Pharisees' accusation. Additionally, I will consider adding context in a footnote to explain the implications of their statement without altering the primary text. The phrasing will be adjusted to improve flow, making the language accessible to contemporary readers, while still maintaining fidelity to the source material.|

The use of 'healing every disease and every affliction' is particularly strong to emphasize the breadth of His compassion and power.|
|MAT 9:36|But when He saw the crowds, He was filled with compassion for them, because they were harassed and helpless, like sheep without a shepherd.|The aim is to create a literal translation of Matthew 9:36 while incorporating the provided corrections. I will retain the phrase 'filled with compassion' to express Jesus' emotional depth accurately. I will modify 'weary and scattered' to 'harassed and helpless' to enhance clarity without losing the essence of the original Greek. I will keep 'like sheep without a shepherd' as it carries significant theological weight. Overall, the translation should maintain readability and fluency while avoiding redundancy. Each change must align with previous editing decisions, ensuring coherence throughout the text.|
|MAT 9:37|Then He said to His disciples, 'The harvest is indeed abundant, but the laborers are few.'|In this translation, the imagery of harvest is maintained, emphasizing both the abundance of the harvest and the scarcity of laborers. The use of 'plentiful' for 'πολύς' and 'few' for 'ὀλίγοι' reflects the original meaning while remaining accessible to contemporary readers.|
|MAT 9:38|Therefore, pray to the Lord of the harvest to send out workers into His harvest.|In crafting the updated translation for Matthew 9:38, I will prioritize the correction suggestions that emphasize emotional depth, formal tone, and clarity. I will replace 'plead' with 'pray' to better convey the urgency of the request to the Lord of the harvest, aligning with the spiritual context of prayer. Additionally, while maintaining 'laborers,' I will consider a more resonant alternative such as 'workers' if it fits smoothly. I aim for an idiomatic expression that remains true to the source text but feels contemporary for readers while retaining a degree of formality. Overall, my goal is to enhance readability without losing theological accuracy or the emotional resonance of the original text.|
