| Reference | Verse | Translation Notes |
|:---------:|-------|-------------------|
|MAT 1:1|The record of the genealogy of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham.|In this translation, the emphasis is on the lineage and identity of Jesus Christ as both a descendant of David and Abraham, underscoring His fulfillment of Old Testament prophecy regarding the Messiah.|
|MAT 1:2|Abraham fathered Isaac, Isaac fathered Jacob, and Jacob fathered Judah and his brothers.|In this verse, the genealogy is being recounted, highlighting the lineage from Abraham to Isaac and then to Jacob. The use of 'begat' here denotes a direct paternal relationship, emphasizing the familial connections significant in the Jewish tradition.|
|MAT 1:3|Judah fathered Perez and Zerah by Tamar; Perez fathered Hezron.|To translate MAT 1:3 with fidelity to the original Greek while enhancing readability, I will adopt 'fathered' over 'begot' for consistency in this genealogy. I will also adjust the phrase 'through Tamar' to 'by Tamar' to maintain clarity. Additionally, I'll ensure that the translation maintains originality to avoid any issues with plagiarism. As part of the contextual information, I will briefly mention Tamar's significance in the lineage, as she is an important female figure in the genealogy of Jesus.|
|MAT 1:4|Ram begat Amminadab; Amminadab begat Nahshon; and Nahshon begat Salmon.|To enhance the translation of MAT 1:4, I will utilize 'begat' in place of 'fathered' to stay true to the traditional biblical vernacular while ensuring that the structure remains clear and understandable. I will maintain the genealogical pattern evident in the original Greek text, emphasizing the lineage without altering the original meaning. This adjustment will help maintain consistency with other translations while ensuring originality. The refinements will contribute to a smoother reading experience and improve overall stylistic coherence in the genealogy presented in this passage.|
|MAT 1:5|Salmon fathered Boaz by Rahab, and Boaz fathered Obed by Ruth, and Obed fathered Jesse.|This verse emphasizes the genealogy of Jesus Christ, linking significant women like Rahab and Ruth to key male figures, highlighting God's inclusion of Gentiles and His work through unexpected people in the lineage of the Messiah.|
|MAT 1:6|And Jesse fathered David, the king; and David, the king, fathered Solomon through the wife of Uriah the Hittite.|In revising the translation of MAT 1:6, I will incorporate the feedback provided in the peer review to enhance specificity and clarity. This includes referring to 'the wife of Uriah' as 'the wife of Uriah the Hittite' to provide deeper contextual understanding and to use 'through' instead of 'by' to better express the relational dynamics. I will ensure that the updated translation maintains a literal approach, remaining faithful to the original text while also considering the readability for English-speaking audiences. The overall aim is to preserve theological significance while enhancing clarity.|
|MAT 1:7|Solomon begat Rehoboam; Rehoboam begat Abijah; Abijah begat Asa.|To ensure consistency in terminology, I will use 'begat' for all instances in the genealogy section as per the correction guidelines. This choice aligns with traditional biblical language and maintains a formal tone throughout the passage. I will strictly adhere to a literal translation without adding unnecessary commentary, while being original in phrasing to avoid any potential plagiarism. My goal is to create a translation that is clear, respectful of the original text, and reflects conservative Christian values.|
|MAT 1:8|Asa begat Jehoshaphat; Jehoshaphat begat Jehoram, and Jehoram begat Uzziah.|In this reflection, I will address the necessary corrections for Matthew 1:8. First, I will maintain the use of 'begat' for consistency throughout the genealogical passages. Second, I will enhance clarity and readability by adjusting sentence structure and employing commas or semicolons to vary the flow. I will ensure that the verse remains aligned with the original text's meaning while being distinct from other translations to adhere to copyright laws. Finally, I will strike a balance between traditional biblical language and contemporary understanding to cater to a conservative Christian audience.|
|MAT 1:9|Uzziah fathered Jotham; Jotham fathered Ahaz; and Ahaz fathered Hezekiah.|This verse continues the genealogy of Jesus, emphasizing the line of kings from Uzziah through Jotham and Ahaz to Hezekiah. It maintains the structure seen in earlier verses, employing the phrase 'fathered' to indicate lineage and heritage.|
|MAT 1:10|Hezekiah fathered Manasseh; Manasseh fathered Amon; and Amon fathered Josiah.|I will revise MAT 1:10 to use the term 'fathered' instead of 'begot' for clarity and readability. I will also consider the genealogical context and ensure the essence of the passage is preserved while maintaining consistency with previous translations in this genealogy. Footnotes or explanations about the significance of the figures can be suggested in a study guide rather than in the main text to avoid clutter.|
|MAT 1:11|And Josiah fathered Jeconiah and his brothers at the time of the Babylonian exile.|To provide a more literal translation of MAT 1:11, I will revise the phrase 'and his brothers and relatives' to simply 'and his brothers' in accordance with the original text. Additionally, I will modify 'during the Babylonian exile' to 'at the time of the Babylonian exile' to enhance clarity while maintaining faithfulness to the source. This revision will reflect the specific request for precision and adherence to a conservative Christian perspective.|
|MAT 1:12|After the Babylonian exile, Jeconiah fathered Shealtiel, and Shealtiel fathered Zerubbabel.|To revise Matthew 1:12, I will incorporate the suggestions to improve clarity while maintaining fidelity to the original text. I will replace 'Following' with 'After' to enhance readability, use 'fathered' uniformly instead of 'begat' for consistency, and clarify the genealogical relationships by structuring the sentence to highlight the lineage directly. I will also ensure that the revised translation is distinct from existing versions to avoid copyright issues. Thus, the updated translation will read: 'After the Babylonian exile, Jeconiah fathered Shealtiel, and Shealtiel fathered Zerubbabel.'|
|MAT 1:13|Zerubbabel fathered Abiud, Abiud fathered Eliakim, and Eliakim fathered Azor.|In this verse, we see the lineage continued with the mention of Zerubbabel and his descendants, using the word 'ἐγέννησε' which indicates 'begat' or 'gave birth to', demonstrating the genealogy of Jesus. The use of names reflects the historical and spiritual lineage leading to Christ, a key element in Matthew's genealogy.|
|MAT 1:14|Azor fathered Sadok, Sadok fathered Achim, and Achim fathered Elihud.|This verse highlights the generational lineage leading to Jesus, with careful attention to the connections between each ancestor. The original text's emphasis on 'begat' is maintained here with 'fathered' for clarity in modern English.|
|MAT 1:15|Elihud fathered Eleazar; Eleazar fathered Matthan; and Matthan fathered Jacob.|To achieve a more readable and consistent translation, I will replace 'became the father of' with 'fathered'. This maintains traditional biblical language and improves the flow of the genealogical list. Additionally, I will ensure the same terminology is used consistently throughout the genealogy for clarity. To enhance the overall reading experience, I will employ uniform conjunctions. Minor stylistic improvements will be made for formality without compromising the text's fidelity. Furthermore, I will consider adding a brief note regarding the significance of genealogies in biblical literature for the reader's context.|
|MAT 1:16|And Jacob fathered Joseph, the husband of Mary, of whom was born Jesus, who is called Christ.|This verse highlights the significant lineage leading to Jesus, emphasizing Joseph's role as the earthly father of Jesus and underscoring the miraculous birth through Mary. The term 'husband' indicates the legal and social acknowledgment of their relationship, while the phrase 'called Christ' denotes Jesus' anointed status as the Messiah.|
|MAT 1:17|Therefore, all generations from Abraham unto David are fourteen generations; and from David unto the Babylonian exile are fourteen generations; and from the Babylonian exile unto Christ are fourteen generations.|To produce a literal translation that is faithful to the Greek text of MAT 1:17 while implementing corrections, I will enhance the phrasing for clarity and flow, particularly focusing on the repeated phrase 'fourteen generations.' I will adopt a more formal tone, ensuring it resonates with a conservative Christian audience. The use of 'generations are fourteen' maintains a close structure to the Greek text and emphasizes the significance of the genealogy. I will also clarify the context regarding the Babylonian exile without resorting to familiar phrases in existing translations.|
|MAT 1:18|Now the birth of Jesus Christ took place in this manner: when His mother Mary was betrothed to Joseph, before they came together, she was found to be with child by the Holy Spirit.|In revising Matthew 1:18, I aim to incorporate terminology that reflects a contemporary understanding while ensuring fidelity to the original text. The term 'betrothed' aligns closely with the cultural and historical context of engagement in ancient Jewish customs. I will also refine the phrase about conception by the Holy Spirit for greater fluidity, emphasizing the miraculous aspect of the virgin birth. The literal translation aspects will be preserved to uphold the text's theological implications. I will ensure the tone remains formal, respectful, and consistent with conservative Christian values. Additional notes on terms like 'Holy Spirit' may be necessary to aid understanding without altering the text itself.|
|MAT 1:19|But Joseph her husband, being a righteous man and unwilling to bring her public disgrace, resolved to put her away secretly.|In revising Matthew 1:19, I will focus on maintaining theological accuracy and cultural relevance in the translation. I will keep 'righteous man' for theological alignment and emphasize Joseph's concern for avoiding public disgrace rather than just 'shame.' The phrase 'intended to divorce' will be changed to 'resolved to divorce' to convey the seriousness of his decision. Additionally, I will ensure that the cultural context of betrothal and divorce is more apparent, reflecting the gravity of Joseph's situation and his character as a man of integrity. The aim is to provide a translation that is faithful to the original text while enhancing clarity and understanding for modern readers.|
|MAT 1:20|But while he pondered these things, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream, saying, 'Joseph, son of David, do not be afraid to take Mary as your wife; for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Spirit.'|In this translation, I've emphasized the importance of divine revelation through dreams and the comforting nature of the angel's message. The term 'Holy Spirit' is rendered consistently, reflecting the original Greek text while maintaining clarity in English. The structure follows closely to enhance the sense of immediacy and importance of the message given to Joseph.|
|MAT 1:21|And she will give birth to a Son, and you shall name Him Jesus, for He will save His people from their sins.|In this verse, the name 'Jesus' is significant as it means 'Yahweh saves'. The phrase 'he will save' indicates Jesus' primary mission on earth, which is to save His people from their sins. This aligns with the prophecies concerning the Messiah in the Old Testament.|
|MAT 1:22|All this took place to fulfill what the Lord spoke through the prophet, saying:|To ensure the translation of Matthew 1:22 aligns with the specified corrections, I will adopt direct phrasing to enhance clarity while preserving the traditional formality suited for a conservative audience. I will refer to 'the prophet' to maintain ambiguity about which prophet is referenced while still ensuring that it connects logically to the following verse about the prophecy. This approach will also emphasize the significance of the fulfillment without adding excessive detail that could detract from the clarity of the main point. The updated translation will directly reflect these goals.|
|MAT 1:23|Behold, the virgin will conceive in her womb and bear a son, and they shall call His name Emmanuel, which is translated, 'God is with us.'|In updating the translation of MAT 1:23, I will emphasize the prophetic fulfillment aspect by incorporating language that underscores the significance of the prophecy. To enhance clarity and flow, I will rephrase the part that describes the meaning of 'Emmanuel' without being overly casual. I will maintain the literalness of the translation while ensuring that the theological implications are strong and in line with conservative Christian beliefs regarding the identity of Jesus and His divine presence. Overall, the revised translation will reflect these priorities while staying true to the original Greek text.|
|MAT 1:24|And when Joseph awoke from sleep, he did as the angel of the Lord commanded him and received Mary as his wife.|To refine MAT 1:24, I will address the following points: First, I'll change 'took his wife' to 'received his wife' to reflect a more culturally appropriate acceptance. Second, I'll simplify 'awoke from his sleep' to 'awoke from sleep' to enhance the sentence flow. Third, I will ensure that Joseph's obedience to the angel's command is clearly emphasized in the sentence structure. Lastly, I will consider starting with 'the angel of the Lord' to maintain clarity and respect the flow of the narrative.|
|MAT 1:25|And he did not know her intimately until she had given birth to her firstborn son, and he named him Jesus.|This verse speaks to the divine fulfillment of prophecy regarding the birth of Jesus, highlighting Joseph's role in this sacred event. The phrase 'knew her not' refers to Joseph's abstinence from marital relations with Mary until after Jesus' birth, underscoring the miraculous nature of the event and the virginity of Mary.|
