| Reference | Verse | Translation Notes |
|:---------:|-------|-------------------|
|MAT 7:1|Do not judge, so that you will not be judged.|To create an updated translation of MAT 7:1, I will remove any interpretative additions and maintain a literal approach that reflects the original Greek text. I will also emphasize the community aspect of judgment by replacing the vague term 'others' with a term that indicates judging within the faith community. This aligns with the overall theme of humility and self-examination in Jesus' teachings. The focus will remain on accurately capturing the intent of the scripture without extraneous commentary.|
|MAT 7:2|For with the measure you use to judge, it will be measured back to you.|To create an updated translation for Matthew 7:2, I will focus on maintaining word choice consistency by using 'measure' in a way that reflects traditional biblical language. I will simplify the phrasing to improve readability while ensuring the essential meaning is preserved. Additionally, I will emphasize the contrast between divine judgment and human standards, highlighting the importance of the measure we use in judgment. I aim for a formal yet clear style to align with conservative interpretations, ensuring the translation flows naturally and effectively conveys the intended message.|
|MAT 7:3|Why do you see the speck that is in your brother's eye, but do not perceive the log that is in your own eye?|In approaching the translation of MAT 7:3, I will prioritize clarity and directness to ensure that modern readers understand the verse without losing its original meaning. By replacing 'mote' with 'speck', the imagery remains accessible while retaining the metaphorical contrast with 'log'. I will also refine the sentence structure slightly for improved readability, while making sure that the essence of self-examination remains intact. The final translation will closely follow the Greek text and maintain theological integrity, appealing to a conservative Christian audience.|
|MAT 7:4|Or how can you say to your brother, ‘Let me take the speck out of your eye,’ when there is a beam in your own eye?|In this translation, the focus is on the hypocrisy of pointing out a fault in others while ignoring one's own greater faults. The terms for 'brother' and 'eye' are preserved for their significant relational and metaphorical implications. The imagery of the 'speck' and 'beam' emphasizes the contrast between minor and major flaws, reinforcing the idea of self-examination before offering correction to others.|
|MAT 7:5|You hypocrite! First, take the log out of your own eye, and then you will see clearly to take the speck out of your brother's eye.|This verse highlights the importance of self-examination before attempting to correct others. The metaphor of the 'log' versus the 'speck' emphasizes the discrepancy in severity between one's own faults and those of others. The translation seeks to convey the original Greek meaning in a straightforward manner that maintains the imagery of vision and correction.|
|MAT 7:6|Do not give what is holy to dogs, nor cast your pearls before swine, lest they trample them underfoot and turn back to tear you.|The goal is to create a literal translation that reflects the original Greek text of MAT 7:6, while ensuring clarity in English. I will eliminate the interpretive commentary at the end of the previous translation and focus solely on rendering the text accurately. I'll also adjust the English phrasing for better flow while retaining its literal meaning. Additionally, I will note cultural contexts regarding 'dogs' and 'swine' in footnotes, to help readers understand these terms in their biblical context.|
|MAT 7:7|Ask, and it will be given to you; seek, and you will find; knock, and it will be opened for you.|The translation of Matthew 7:7 needs to maintain its literal meaning while improving clarity and engagement for the reader. The suggestions to prefer 'ask' over 'inquire' and 'seek' over 'search' are important for ensuring that the translation is relatable and easily understood. Additionally, providing context to emphasize the implications of asking, seeking, and knocking will enhance the reader's comprehension and connection to the text. I will also focus on maintaining a rhythm in the phrasing that resonates with traditional scriptural language without losing fidelity to the original Greek.|
|MAT 7:8|For everyone who asks receives, and he who seeks finds, and to him who knocks, it shall be opened.|The goal is to provide a translation of MAT 7:8 that is both literal and reflects a traditional biblical style. The original translation was strong, but it lacked some of the formal qualities typical of biblical language. I will consider using more nuanced terms while maintaining clarity and flow. In particular, I'll look for synonyms that have a more 'biblical' resonance, and structure the sentence to enhance its formality. The translation must also ensure it conveys God's generosity in responding to prayer, in line with conservative Christian understanding.|
|MAT 7:9|Or what man among you, if his son asks for bread, will give him a stone?|This verse emphasizes the nature of fatherhood and the goodness inherent in giving. It contrasts the expectations of a loving father against the absurdity of giving something harmful when a child requests something basic and good, like bread. The imagery of bread is consistent throughout scripture as a staple of life, representing sustenance and care.|
|MAT 7:10|And if he asks for a fish, will he give him a serpent rather?|To update Matthew 7:10, I will first ensure that the translation is literal and faithful to the original Greek text. I will revise the phrase to enhance clarity and fluidity, ensuring that it captures the rhetorical contrast effectively. I will consider using 'rather' in place of 'instead' for a smoother reading. Additionally, I'll make sure that the translation aligns with conservative Christian perspectives. This involves both maintaining theological integrity and ensuring the language is accessible for modern readers. I will keep the context in mind, focusing on the relationship between the verses to underscore the implications of God's goodness compared to human tendencies.|
|MAT 7:11|If you, being evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father who is in heaven give good things to those who ask Him?|This verse emphasizes the contrast between human limitations and divine generosity. It uses the word 'evil' (πονηροὶ) to highlight our fallen nature, yet points to the goodness of God in His willingness to give good gifts to His children. The focus is on the relationship between God and believers, particularly the assurance that God knows and fulfills the needs of His people.|
|MAT 7:12|Therefore, whatever you want others to do for you, do also for them; for this sums up the Law and the Prophets.|To enhance the clarity and readability of the translation, I will simplify the phrasing while maintaining a formal tone that aligns with biblical style. I will focus on making the language direct, aiming for distinctiveness to ensure originality while staying true to the original meaning. Additionally, I will emphasize the theological significance of the Golden Rule by reinforcing its connection to the Law and the Prophets in a more resonant manner.|
|MAT 7:13|Enter through the narrow gate; for the gate is wide and the broad way that leads to destruction, and many are those who enter through it.|To improve the translation of MAT 7:13, I will focus on enhancing terminology consistency by using 'the narrow gate' and 'the broad way' instead of 'the path is spacious.' This will align the translation with traditional language that resonates with conservative Christian readers. Additionally, I will maintain fidelity to the original text while ensuring clarity and readability for contemporary audiences. I will avoid plagiarism by rephrasing certain terms while keeping the core message intact. The urgency of the choices between life and destruction will be highlighted through careful word selection. The updated translation will reflect these considerations, providing a faithful yet original interpretation of the verse.|
|MAT 7:14|How narrow is the gate, and how pressed is the way that leads to life! And few are those who find it.|In reviewing Matthew 7:14, I aim to refine the translation to reflect the suggestions from the peer review while remaining true to the original Greek text. The term 'τεθλιμμένη' (translated as 'difficult') can indeed be enhanced by using 'pressed' or 'afflicted' to better convey the meaning of being under pressure or hardship. Additionally, incorporating more traditional phrasing can resonate well with conservative audiences, emphasizing the serious implications of the narrow path. I will avoid overly paraphrasing to maintain literal fidelity. Therefore, I will translate the verse as follows: 'How narrow is the gate, and how pressed is the way that leads to life! And few are those who find it.' This translation aims to honor the original Greek while reflecting the requested changes.|
|MAT 7:15|Beware of false prophets, who come to you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly they are ravenous wolves.|In this verse, the imagery of false prophets dressed as sheep conveys the deceptive nature of these individuals, who appear benign but are actually dangerous. The term 'wolves' denotes their predatory intent. The translation seeks to capture both the literal and metaphorical aspects of the warning Jesus gives about discernment.|
|MAT 7:16|You will know them by their fruits. Do people gather grapes from thornbushes or figs from thistles?|In this verse, the metaphor of trees and their fruits is used to convey the idea that true character and nature are revealed through actions and outcomes. The terms 'thorns' and 'thistles' represent falsehood, while 'grapes' and 'figs' symbolize the good that comes from genuine faith.|
|MAT 7:17|In the same way, every good tree produces good fruit, but a rotten tree produces bad fruit.|This verse illustrates the principle that a tree is identified by its fruit, emphasizing the contrast between good and evil. The use of the words 'good tree' and 'bad tree' signifies moral quality, while 'good fruit' and 'evil fruit' signify the results of that quality in actions or deeds.|
|MAT 7:18|A good tree cannot bear bad fruit, nor can a bad tree bear good fruit.|This verse emphasizes the principle of good and bad being inherently linked to their sources. The 'tree' metaphor illustrates the idea that the nature of a thing dictates its output, a consistent theme throughout biblical teaching on morality and behavior.|
|MAT 7:19|Every tree that does not produce good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.|This translation emphasizes the finality and seriousness of the fate of unproductive trees, capturing the metaphorical weight of judgment in the context of spiritual fruitfulness.|
|MAT 7:20|Therefore, by their fruits you shall know them.|To enhance the translation of Matthew 7:20, I will incorporate phrasing that reflects the style and structure of surrounding verses, particularly those focusing on the theme of discernment and judgment based on actions and results. Additionally, I will aim for a more formal and traditional biblical language that is consistent with other translations while avoiding plagiarism. Lastly, I will provide a brief contextual commentary that connects this verse with the preceding verses, emphasizing the importance of recognizing false prophets and the significance of their 'fruits'.|
|MAT 7:21|Not everyone who says to me, 'Lord, Lord,' will enter the kingdom of heaven; but the one who does the will of my Father who is in heaven will enter.|In revising MAT 7:21, I aim to clarify the distinction between those who merely acknowledge Jesus as Lord and those who actively fulfill the will of the Father. To achieve this, I will replace 'calls out to me' with 'says to me' to better reflect the original Greek and enhance the clarity of the verse. Additionally, I will make slight adjustments to the phrasing to improve fluency and readability. I will also ensure that the contrast between the two groups is emphasized, underscoring the seriousness of merely verbal acknowledgment versus genuine obedience. Throughout the process, I will maintain fidelity to the original text to avoid plagiarism while making it accessible for contemporary readers.|
|MAT 7:22|Many will say to me on that Day of Judgment, 'Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in Your name, cast out demons in Your name, and perform many mighty works in Your name?'|To improve the translation of MAT 7:22, I will ensure clarity regarding 'that day' by explicitly referencing the Day of Judgment. I will maintain the theological significance of the terms by keeping 'prophesy' and possibly 'mighty works' as they relate closely to the actions taken in Jesus' name. Enhancing readability is key, so I will refine phrases while retaining their original meaning. The use of future tense will clarify that many will express their actions at the time of judgment. Minor adjustments will also be made to enhance overall clarity, making sure it is consistent with conservative Christian values.|
|MAT 7:23|And then I will declare to them, 'I never knew you; depart from me, you workers of lawlessness.'|This verse highlights the severe consequence of being rejected by Christ due to a life of sin despite outward appearances of faith. The term 'anomia' conveys a strong sense of lawlessness or iniquity, emphasizing the serious nature of the rejection.|
|MAT 7:24|Therefore, everyone who hears these words of mine and acts upon them is like a wise man who built his house on the rock.|To enhance the translation of MAT 7:24, I will incorporate the suggestions provided. The term 'Therefore' will emphasize the logical connection to the preceding verses, underscoring the significance of the actions described. Additionally, I will replace 'puts them into practice' with 'acts upon them' to convey a stronger sense of active engagement with the teachings. The metaphor of the 'wise man' building his house on the rock will be retained as it effectively illustrates the concept of wisdom and stability. Overall, the aim is to ensure clarity and impact while remaining faithful to the original text.|
|MAT 7:25|And the rain fell, and the rivers came, and the winds blew and beat against that house, yet it did not fall, for it was founded upon the rock.|This verse emphasizes the resilience of the house built on the rock amidst challenges such as rain, floods, and winds, symbolizing the trials and tribulations faced by believers. It contrasts with those whose foundations are not secure, illustrating the importance of a strong spiritual foundation in Christ.|
|MAT 7:26|And everyone who hears these words of mine and does not do them will be compared to a foolish man who built his house on the sand.|In revising Matthew 7:26, I will focus on incorporating the suggestions from my peer review. The phrase 'fails to act on them' will be rephrased to 'does not do them' to enhance clarity and reflect the original Greek term 'ποιῶν.' I will also strengthen the emphasis on the consequences of inaction to underline the theological message about the importance of obedience in the conservative Christian context. Additionally, I will ensure that the language remains fluid and readable while maintaining a literal approach. Finally, I will check to ensure the translation is unique and does not inadvertently copy existing translations.|
|MAT 7:27|And the rain fell, and the rivers came, and the winds blew and struck that house; and it fell, and great was its fall.|In this verse, the imagery of storms, floods, and winds conveys the idea of trials and challenges that test the stability of one's foundation—spiritual or otherwise. The language is chosen to reflect the gravity of the consequences faced by those who do not heed wisdom, thus ensuring the gravity of the warning is captured in a fresh manner.|
|MAT 7:28|When Jesus finished speaking, the crowds were astonished at His teaching.|In updating MAT 7:28, I will aim to enhance clarity and readability by using more contemporary language while staying true to the original Greek. The phrase 'When Jesus had completed these sayings' can be revised to 'When Jesus finished speaking' to make it more relatable for modern readers. I will also ensure that the authority of Jesus’ teachings is highlighted in the translation, reflecting the conservative Christian perspective that values the integrity of His message. Additionally, I will keep the sentence flow smooth and readable without sacrificing any of the original text's meaning or depth.|
|MAT 7:29|For He was teaching them as one having authority, and not as the scribes.|The peer review highlighted the effectiveness of the current translation while suggesting improvements for fluidity and readability. To achieve this, I will adjust the phrasing slightly to enhance its naturalness in English while retaining the meaning of the original text. I will also ensure that it avoids any potential plagiarism while remaining faithful to the source material. This involves finding synonyms or rephrasing parts of the sentence without altering the core message of Jesus' authoritative teaching in contrast to the scribes.|
