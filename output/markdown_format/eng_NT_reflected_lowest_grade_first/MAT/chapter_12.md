|:---------:|-------|-------------------|
|MAT 12:1|At that time, Jesus went through the grain fields on the Sabbath, and the disciples became hungry and began to pick ears of grain and eat.|To create a more readable and fluid translation while maintaining a literal approach, I will make adjustments based on the corrections provided. I will change 'pluck heads of grain' to 'pick ears of grain' for clarity. Additionally, I will modify 'His disciples were hungry' to 'the disciples became hungry' to better capture the original action. I will also restructure the sentence for improved flow and clarity without implying exclusivity with 'His disciples'. Overall, the aim is to produce a translation that reads smoothly while being faithful to the source text.|
|MAT 12:2|But when the Pharisees saw it, they said to Him, 'Behold, Your disciples are doing what is not lawful to do on the Sabbath.'|In revising MAT 12:2, I will implement the corrections focused on clarifying the lawfulness of the actions taken by the disciples, emphasizing the Pharisees' authoritative stance in their accusation, and enhancing the formal tone to better reflect the original text's biblical language. Additionally, I will ensure consistent usage of pronouns related to Jesus and avoid any unnecessary repetitions. The aim is to capture the original meaning while enhancing the passage's coherence and understanding for readers in its cultural context.|
|MAT 12:3|But He said to them, 'Have you not read what David did when he and those who were with him became hungry?'|In revising Matthew 12:3, the goal is to create a translation that adheres closely to the original Greek while also addressing the feedback provided. Retaining the phrase 'Have you not read' is crucial for maintaining the verb's authority and aligns with traditional biblical phrasing. To enhance clarity, I will modify 'he and his companions' slightly to maintain the sense of community while improving readability. The translation will retain a formal tone to uphold the reverence of the text. The structure will remain as close to the original as possible, ensuring that the meaning is conveyed effectively without sacrificing fidelity. A contextual note about David's actions will be considered for inclusion in a footnote to enrich understanding without altering the primary text. The ultimate aim is to achieve a balance between literal accuracy and readable prose that reflects the gravity of scripture.|
|MAT 12:4|"How he entered the house of God and ate the bread of the Presence, which it was not lawful for him or those with him to eat, except for the priests alone." <br><br>*Footnote: The 'bread of the Presence' signifies the consecrated bread placed in the Tabernacle, symbolizing the unique role of priests in worship.|To improve clarity in the translation, I will rephrase the segment about the unlawful consumption of the bread to enhance the flow while maintaining the literal meaning. Additionally, I need to ensure that the translation remains faithful to the original text and the theological implications related to mercy and law. The footnote will be succinct to retain focus on the importance of the 'bread of the Presence' without unnecessary elaboration. This approach will also help avoid redundancies from previous translations and emphasize the intended meaning.|
|MAT 12:5|"Or have you not read in the Law that on the Sabbath the priests in the temple desecrate the Sabbath, and yet they are innocent?"|In reviewing MAT 12:5, I recognize the need to balance a literal translation with modern readability and theological nuance. The goal is to ensure that the terms used convey the gravity of the actions discussed while remaining accessible to contemporary readers. Thus, replacing 'profane' with 'desecrate' will better articulate the seriousness of the priests' actions while aligning with the suggestion to emphasize the lawful context. Additionally, maintaining 'innocent' remains crucial as it is consistent with the original Greek text and preserves theological accuracy.|
|MAT 12:6|But I say to you that that which is greater than the temple is here.|In response to the peer reviews for MAT 12:6, I will adjust the translation to reflect a more literal phrasing. This includes substituting 'something greater than the temple' with 'that which is greater than the temple' to align more closely with the Greek structure. I will also simplify the language to improve clarity by using 'the temple' directly. Additionally, I will consider including a brief explanatory note to highlight the significance of Jesus' authority in relation to the temple, while maintaining a formal tone.|
|MAT 12:7|"If you had understood what 'I desire mercy and not sacrifice' means, you would not have condemned the innocent."|I will rephrase the final part of MAT 12:7 for clarity and to avoid redundancy. I will use 'condemned the innocent' instead of 'declared the innocent guilty' for better fluidity while keeping the translation literal and true to the original Greek structure. I will also ensure that the overall theological message about mercy and sacrifice is clear without merging contextual notes into the translation. This ensures the translation remains focused on the text while allowing readers to understand its significance within biblical teachings.|
|MAT 12:8|"For the Son of Man is Lord over the Sabbath." (This statement underscores Jesus' authority over the Sabbath, signifying that He embodies the true purpose of the law and offers mercy to those in need.)|To address the correction instructions, I will focus on enhancing the clarity of Jesus' authority over the Sabbath by rewording the translation. Using contemporary language while ensuring faithfulness to the original text will be key. I will also expand the commentary to explain the theological significance of Jesus as Lord, highlighting his role in fulfilling the law and his emphasis on divine mercy. The commentary will be clearly separated from the translation to avoid confusion.|
|MAT 12:9|And moving on from there, He entered into their synagogue. <br><br>*Footnote: The synagogue served as a central place of worship and teaching for the Jewish community, highlighting Jesus' authority as He engaged with both the religious leaders and the faithful within this sacred space.|To enhance the translation of MAT 12:9 while maintaining fidelity to the original Greek, I will incorporate a slightly more readable phrasing and provide additional contextual information through a footnote. The translation will remain literal but will benefit from the contextual richness of synagogues and Jesus' authority as it relates to the events of this passage.|
|MAT 12:10|And behold, a man was there with a withered hand. And they questioned Him, saying, 'Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath?'—in order that they might accuse Him.|In this updated translation of MAT 12:10, I aim to enhance clarity and flow while maintaining a literal connection to the original Greek text. By changing 'Is it permissible to heal on the Sabbath?' to 'Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath?', I create a more traditional tone that resonates with conservative Christian beliefs. Additionally, I will emphasize the Pharisees' motives to trap Jesus, highlighting their intent while keeping the focus on the narrative. The phrasing will be adjusted to reflect a more formal and traditional biblical tone. I will also remove any redundant expressions to ensure clarity and impact in the translation.|
|MAT 12:11|But He said to them, 'Which of you, if he has one sheep, and it falls into a pit on the Sabbath, would not rescue it and lift it out?'|To enhance the rhetorical engagement, I will rephrase the opening question for better impact. I will emphasize Jesus' teachings on mercy and the sanctity of human life to provide context for the question. I will replace 'take hold of' with 'rescue' to improve accessibility while maintaining seriousness. Additionally, I will reposition 'on the Sabbath' to emphasize its importance in the sentence, ensuring the phrasing is clear and readable.|
|MAT 12:12|How much more valuable is a man than a sheep? Therefore, it is lawful to do good on the Sabbath.|This verse emphasizes the value of human life and well-being compared to animals, highlighting the permissibility of doing good on the Sabbath. The term 'καλῶς ποιεῖν' (to do good) suggests actions that align with righteousness, particularly in the context of compassion and care.|
|MAT 12:13|Then He said to the man, 'Stretch out your hand.' And he stretched it out, and it was restored whole, like the other hand.|In translating MAT 12:13, I will maintain the phrase 'Stretch out your hand' to convey Jesus' direct command effectively. I will refine 'it was restored to its original condition' to 'it was restored whole' to emphasize the miraculous nature of the healing, while changing 'as the other' to 'like the other hand' for clearer contextual reference. This maintains a balance between literal accuracy and contemporary readability, ensuring the translation reflects the full healing aspect. Overall, I will implement these adjustments while remaining faithful to the source text.|
|MAT 12:14|"But the Pharisees went out and conspired against Him, that they might destroy Him." <br><br>*Footnote: This verse illustrates the deliberate plotting of the Pharisees against Jesus, indicating their escalating hostility toward His ministry and teachings. It reflects a fundamental conflict between the compassion and authority exhibited by Jesus and the rigid legalism upheld by the Pharisees. Their actions not only signify their rejection of Jesus as the Messiah but also highlight the ongoing tension within the Gospel narrative between mercy and legalism, emphasizing the necessity of understanding Jesus’ mission in light of these opposing forces.|In revising Matthew 12:14, I will ensure the translation remains faithful to the original text while enhancing clarity and maintaining a formal tone. I will choose words that convey the intensity of the Pharisees' conspiracy against Jesus, opting for 'conspire' and 'destroy' to preserve the original's forceful intent. The footnote will be expanded to explore the implications of their actions, framing the narrative conflict between Jesus' divine authority and the rigid legalism of the Pharisees. It will emphasize how this moment foreshadows broader themes of mercy versus legalism throughout Jesus' ministry, ensuring a more objective language to adhere to a literal translation goal. This approach aligns with a conservative Christian perspective, highlighting the theological significance without compromising textual fidelity.|
|MAT 12:15|But Jesus, aware of this, withdrew from there. Many crowds followed Him, and He healed them all.|This verse highlights the compassionate nature of Jesus, emphasizing His ability to heal and His response to the multitude that followed Him, indicating His recognition of their needs and His commitment to ministering to them.|
|MAT 12:16|And He charged them not to make Him known.|In updating Matthew 12:16, I will replace 'sternly' with 'charged' to more accurately reflect the Greek term 'ἐπετίμησεν,' which carries a connotation of authority. I will also consider adding a footnote to explain the significance of Jesus' instruction not to make Him known, highlighting how it fits into the broader context of His ministry and messianic identity. Furthermore, I will ensure that the translation remains literal while providing a clearer understanding of the text's implications for the audience.|
|MAT 12:17|So that what was spoken by the prophet Isaiah might be fulfilled, saying:|To enhance the readability and clarity of MAT 12:17, I will start the verse with 'The prophet Isaiah said:' This rephrasing will provide immediate context to the reader about the prophetic fulfillment being referenced. I will also simplify the language by changing 'In order that what was spoken' to 'So that what was spoken,' which maintains the meaning but improves flow. The goal is to preserve the theological significance while ensuring the verse is easily understood without compromising its reverence.|
|MAT 12:18|"Behold, My Servant whom I have chosen, My Beloved in whom My soul is well-pleased. I will place My Spirit upon Him, and He will declare justice to the nations."|The objective is to enhance the existing translation of MAT 12:18 by making it more literal while clarifying terms and ensuring that the theological implications are preserved. This requires a balance between sticking closely to the Greek syntax and improving readability. Specific focus will be given to the terms used, especially 'justice,' which may need clarification. By addressing these points, the translation can become both faithful to the original text and understandable for contemporary readers. Overall, the translation will reflect the authority and mission of Jesus, consistent with conservative Christian perspectives.|
|MAT 12:19|He will not quarrel or cry out, nor will anyone hear His voice in the streets.|This verse illustrates the gentleness and quiet authority of Christ's ministry, emphasizing that He does not strive or raise His voice in the pursuit of His mission. The choice of words reflects His humility and the peaceful nature of His approach to proclaiming justice.|
|MAT 12:20|"A bruised reed He will not break, and a smoldering wick He will not extinguish, until He brings justice to victory."|To improve the translation of MAT 12:20, I will focus on clarity and familiarity in phrasing while maintaining theological accuracy. I will revert 'flickering wick' to 'smoldering wick' to ensure consistency with common biblical language. The phrase 'until He brings forth justice unto victory' will be rephrased for better clarity, using 'until He brings justice to victory,' which enhances understanding without losing the original meaning. Furthermore, I will ensure that the translation flows smoothly and retains a poetic quality that reflects the depth of the message, particularly given the compassionate portrayal of Jesus. Overall, the aim is to create a translation that is both faithful to the original text and accessible to modern readers.|
|MAT 12:21|"And in His name, the nations will hope." <br><br>*Footnote: This verse illustrates the profound expectation that the nations have in the Messiah's name, emphasizing reliance on His identity and mission for salvation, fulfilling the Messianic promises and extending hope to all peoples.|In addressing the provided corrections for MAT 12:21, I will prioritize a formal tone while using traditional phrasing. The word 'hope in' will be maintained, as it aligns well with the expected formal register and carries the appropriate theological weight. To ensure clarity and readability, I will rephrase slightly for smoother flow without losing fidelity to the original Greek. The footnote will succinctly summarize the Messianic significance, ensuring it complements rather than overshadows the verse itself. I will ensure the language used remains distinct from existing translations to uphold originality and comply with copyright laws. This approach aims to resonate with conservative Christian audiences by reinforcing the theological depth of the verse.|
|MAT 12:22|Then a demon-possessed man who was blind and mute was brought to Him, and He healed him, so that he could both speak and see.|In updating the translation of MAT 12:22, the focus is on clarity, naturalness, and a formal structure. Using 'a demon-possessed man' improves clarity. The phrasing regarding the results of the healing is streamlined to 'so that he could both speak and see' to eliminate redundancy while preserving the miraculous nature of the event. The overall tone is adjusted to reflect compassion without using the word explicitly. This careful balance maintains fidelity to the original text while improving readability.|
|MAT 12:23|And all the crowds were astonished and said, "Is this not the Christ, the Son of David?"|In addressing the corrections for MAT 12:23, the focus is on retaining the recognizable phrase 'Is this not the Christ, the Son of David?' which will resonate more with readers. Emphasizing 'the Son of David' reinforces its messianic implications. Additionally, consistency in capitalization of theological terms is maintained for clarity and respect for tradition. Minor stylistic adjustments will enhance readability without veering from the original text. Care will be taken to ensure no interpretive commentary seeps into the translation, thereby keeping the original meaning intact. Contextual notes may be added separately if needed for clarity.|
|MAT 12:24|But the Pharisees, hearing this, said, "This man does not cast out demons except by Beelzebul, the lord of the demons."|To revise MAT 12:24, I will incorporate feedback regarding clarity, redundancy, and fluidity. I will change 'οἱ δὲ Φαρισαῖοι ἀκούσαντες εἶπον' to 'But the Pharisees, hearing this, said' to enhance clarity. I will also modify 'ἄρχοντι τῶν δαιμονίων' to 'the lord of the demons' for precision, avoiding redundancy. Overall, the aim is to maintain a literal translation while ensuring that the verse flows well and minimizes interpretative bias.|
|MAT 12:25|But knowing their thoughts, Jesus said to them, "Every kingdom that is divided against itself will become desolate, and every city or house that is divided against itself will not endure."|In addressing Matthew 12:25, I will ensure that the translation remains faithful to the original Greek text while improving stylistic flow and readability for a contemporary audience. I will incorporate the theological implications of division that Jesus warns about and use phrasing that is unique yet retains the core meaning. The structure should maintain a literal approach while emphasizing the importance of unity in the context of Jesus' message.|
|MAT 12:26|"And if Satan casts out Satan, he is divided against himself; how then will his kingdom stand?" <br><br>*Footnote: This verse illustrates the absurdity of Satan's internal conflict, emphasizing that if he opposes his own agents, it undermines the stability of his own kingdom. This highlights the authority of Jesus in casting out demons, as it demonstrates that He operates in a realm that is united against evil.|The verse MAT 12:26 contains the concept of internal conflict within Satan's realm, which is pivotal for understanding Jesus' argument against the Pharisees. I will maintain the original wording 'Satan casts out Satan' for clarity and to keep the integrity of the text. I will also revise 'he is in conflict with himself' to 'he is divided against himself' to align more closely with traditional translations and to enhance clarity. A contextual footnote will be included to provide further insight into the implications of this division in relation to spiritual authority.|

Overall, the translation will maintain a literal style while ensuring it flows naturally for the reader.|
|MAT 12:28|But if I cast out demons by the Spirit of God, then the Kingdom of God has come upon you.|To ensure clarity and fidelity in the translation of MAT 12:28, I will capitalize 'Spirit' to emphasize its divine nature and use a more literal translation of 'ἔφθασεν.' Additionally, I will consider how to incorporate footnotes to elaborate on the significance of this passage in the broader theological context. This adjustment aims to maintain accuracy while providing a clearer understanding for readers. By adhering closely to the source language, the translation will better reflect the original meaning and intent.|

Then he will surely plunder his house." <br><br>*Footnote: This verse highlights the necessity of confronting and overcoming spiritual strongholds to free those who are held captive, showcasing the authority that Jesus has in spiritual warfare and the triumph of His kingdom over evil.|To improve MAT 12:29, I will emphasize the concept of spiritual warfare, focusing on Jesus' authority to bind the strong man. This requires refining the phrasing to enhance fluidity while maintaining the original meaning. Consistent terminology, such as 'plunder' and 'possessions', will be utilized for clarity. I will also add a contextual footnote to connect this idea of spiritual warfare with broader theological themes, ensuring that the translation remains literal and faithful to the original text.|

Additionally, I will clarify the meanings of 'gathering' and 'scattering' to ensure that they are not ambiguous, emphasizing the importance of allegiance to Christ. The language should be simple yet profound, maintaining the seriousness of the context in which it is situated. This revised translation should fit seamlessly with the surrounding verses, enhancing the overall message of Jesus' teachings about loyalty and opposition.|

I will replace 'forgiven' with a term that reflects ongoing implications, and I will ensure the term 'people' is used for inclusivity. The footnote will remain brief, yet provide insights on the serious nature of the blasphemy against the Holy Spirit, clarifying its implications for forgiveness in a contemporary context. The goal is to present the verse in a way that is literal, accessible, and aligned with a conservative Christian perspective.|

Additionally, I will preserve some of the Greek syntax to reflect the weight of the statement. My adjustments will enhance clarity without sacrificing formality, and I will consider the broader context of Jesus' teaching on the unpardonable sin to reinforce understanding.|

The term 'bad' can be refined to 'corrupt' to better capture the intended meaning. The structure of the verse will be adjusted to reflect conditionality clearly by adding 'will be' to both statements. This ensures that the translation effectively communicates the theological significance of Jesus' words regarding moral fruitfulness.

I will evaluate the use of 'produces' and determine if 'brings forth' might enhance readability while keeping it understandable. I'll ensure clarity and fluidity by possibly restructuring the sentence. I will keep the term 'treasure' consistent throughout the translation. Emphasizing the connection between the heart and the outcomes of one's actions will be done to enhance theological understanding. I will avoid redundancy by not using previously adjusted terms for clarity.|
|MAT 12:36|But I say to you that every idle word that people speak, they will give an account for it on the day of judgment.|This verse emphasizes the accountability of individuals for their words, highlighting the seriousness of speech in the context of final judgment.

|MAT 12:37|For by your words you will be justified, and by your words you will be condemned.|This verse highlights the profound implications of our speech, suggesting that our words serve as a reflection of our character and will ultimately determine our justification or condemnation. The emphasis on 'words' in both the context of judgment and the condition of the heart is crucial.|
|MAT 12:38|Then some of the scribes and Pharisees answered Him, saying, 'Teacher, we wish to see a sign from You.'|This translation reflects the urgent desire of the scribes and Pharisees to see a sign, indicative of their skepticism and the challenge posed to Jesus. The phrase 'a sign' is used to signify a miraculous proof of authority, a common request in the Gospels from those questioning Jesus' identity and mission.|
|MAT 12:39|But He answered and said to them, 'A wicked and adulterous generation seeks after a sign, and no sign will be given to it except the sign of Jonah the prophet.'|In this verse, Jesus responds to the request for a sign by condemning the generation as wicked and adulterous, which emphasizes their lack of faith and moral failing. The reference to the 'sign of Jonah' alludes to Jonah's time in the belly of the fish, symbolizing His own death and resurrection. The term 'adulterous' here implies unfaithfulness not just in marital terms, but also in their relationship with God.|
|MAT 12:40|For just as Jonah was in the belly of the great fish for three days and three nights, so will the Son of Man be in the heart of the earth for three days and three nights.|This verse draws a parallel between Jonah's three days in the belly of the great fish and Jesus' impending three days in the heart of the earth, symbolizing death and resurrection. The phrase 'heart of the earth' is an expression referring to the grave or the place of the dead, emphasizing the depth of Jesus' sacrifice.|
|MAT 12:41|The men of Nineveh will rise in judgment with this generation and condemn it, for they repented at the preaching of Jonah; look, something greater than Jonah is here.|To create an updated translation of Matthew 12:41, I will ensure the literal translation remains faithful to the original Greek text while enhancing clarity and flow in English. I will adjust phrasing where necessary, such as changing 'and behold' to 'look,' which maintains a sense of urgency and importance. Additionally, I'll clarify the phrase 'this generation' to make it more accessible to contemporary readers, and use 'will rise' instead of 'will rise up' to streamline the language. These improvements aim to uphold the theological significance while making the verse more engaging for a modern audience.|
|MAT 12:42|The queen of Sheba will stand up in judgment against this generation and will declare it guilty, for she traveled from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon; look, there is one here who is greater than Solomon.|In translating MAT 12:42, I will focus on producing a literal translation that remains true to the Greek text while also enhancing readability for contemporary audiences. I will maintain the term 'the queen of Sheba' for recognition and theological accuracy. Additionally, I will aim for a more active voice in the translation and ensure that references to Christ's divinity are clear, especially regarding the phrase 'something greater than Solomon.'

Finally, I will be careful to avoid any language that closely resembles existing translations to comply with copyright laws.|
|MAT 12:43|"When the unclean spirit has gone out of a person, it wanders through desolate places, seeking rest, but it finds none."|In revising the translation for MAT 12:43, the key is to maintain fidelity to the original Greek text while integrating feedback from peer reviews. The suggestion to emphasize the spiritual implications of the unclean spirit's wandering will guide the choice of words. Specifically, replacing 'waterless places' with 'desolate places' not only aligns with the original meaning but also enhances the understanding of spiritual desolation. The aim is to capture both the literal meaning and the underlying spiritual message of the text, ensuring that it remains unique and impactful without borrowing from other translations. I will keep the structure straightforward to retain clarity and accessibility for readers.|
|MAT 12:44|Then it says, 'I will return to the house from where I came out.' And when it arrives, it finds the place idle, having been swept clean and garnished.|In revising MAT 12:44, I will focus on rephrasing the house's condition to better reflect traditional translations and improve clarity. This includes addressing the terms 'swept' and 'beautifully adorned,' opting for 'swept and put in order' or 'swept clean' instead, and replacing 'beautifully adorned' with 'garnished' for accuracy. I will also ensure the phrase about returning to the house is more literal by stating 'I will return to the house from where I came out.' Additionally, I will incorporate the term 'idle' for 'empty' to capture the original Greek nuance, and introduce the participle form 'having been swept' to provide greater accuracy. Finally, I will reflect on the spiritual condition of the house in a way that resonates with conservative theological perspectives.|
|MAT 12:45|Then it goes and takes with it seven other evil spirits more wicked than itself, and when they enter, they dwell there; the latter state of that man is worse than the former. So it will also be with this wicked generation.|To enhance clarity and fluency in MAT 12:45, I will rephrase the sentence for better readability while maintaining the original meaning. I will specify the terminology by consistently using 'evil spirits' instead of variations. Additionally, I will ensure that the relationship between the man's state and the reference to the 'wicked generation' is clear without adding interpretive comments. This will align the translation with conservative Christian perspectives and improve the overall fluidity of the text, using contemporary language where appropriate.|

I will replace casual phrasing and ensure the urgency of the mother's and brothers' request is well-reflected. This requires balancing faithfulness to the original Greek text with a more traditional English rendering.|
|MAT 12:47|And one spoke to Him, saying, 'Behold, Your mother and Your brothers stand outside, desiring to speak with You.'|To enhance clarity, I will simplify the phrasing to make the urgency of the message clearer. I will use a more formal tone by employing traditional biblical language, replacing informal phrases with more elevated language. In revising the word choices, I will aim for a flow that reads naturally in contemporary English while being faithful to the original text. Additionally, I'll ensure that the updated translation maintains distinctiveness from known versions by making careful word choices that reflect originality. Lastly, I will consider providing context around the familial relationship and significance within the verse, ensuring it adds to understanding without detracting from the primary translation.|
|MAT 12:48|And He answered the one who spoke to Him, saying, 'Who is My mother? And who are My brothers?'|In considering the requested enhancements for the translation of MAT 12:48, I will first aim to restructure the sentence for better flow while maintaining the original meaning. The rephrasing from 'But He answered, saying to the one who spoke to Him' to 'And He answered the one who spoke to Him, saying,' provides a smoother transition. I will also retain the capitalization of 'My' in 'My mother' and 'My brothers' to emphasize the familial significance. While I incorporate contextual insights about the spiritual implications of familial relationships, I will ensure that the updated translation remains straightforward without over-complicating the text. My focus will be on preserving the original structure of the Greek text, as well as enhancing emotional and relational nuances without straying from the literal translation objective.|
|MAT 12:49|And stretching out His hand toward His disciples, He said, 'Behold, my mother and my brothers.'|To create a faithful and literal translation of MAT 12:49, it is essential to closely reflect the original Greek text.

The phrase 'my mother and my brothers' is straightforward and effectively highlights the familial ties intended in the verse. This approach aligns well with the provided corrections while ensuring clarity and accessibility for modern audiences.|

The phrase structure will be consistent, emphasizing the familial relationships as metaphors for obedience to God's will.
