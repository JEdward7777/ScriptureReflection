| Reference | Verse | Translation Notes |
|:---------:|-------|-------------------|
|MAT 28:1|After the Sabbath, at dawn on the first day of the week, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary came to see the tomb.|I need to incorporate the suggested changes to ensure that the translation of MAT 28:1 aligns closely with the original Greek text while also improving its readability. By using 'came to see the tomb,' I emphasize the purpose of the women's visit. Additionally, I will adjust 'when dawn broke on the first day of the week' to 'at dawn on the first day of the week' for clarity, and change 'now after the Sabbath' to 'after the Sabbath' to enhance the flow. The aim is to create a translation that captures the significance of the resurrection event without losing the original meaning.|
|MAT 28:2|And lo, a great earthquake occurred; for an angel of the Lord descended from heaven, approached the stone, rolled it away from the entrance, and sat upon it.|In reworking Matthew 28:2, I will focus on enhancing the clarity and flow of the sentence structure while maintaining a formal and traditional tone. I will aim for a more readable phrasing without losing the significance of the miraculous events. Additionally, I will avoid directly copying from existing translations to respect copyright laws while ensuring that the language aligns with a conservative Christian perspective. The use of 'And lo' will be integrated to give a traditional feel to the text, thus retaining the scriptural tone.|
|MAT 28:3|His appearance resembled lightning, and his clothing was white as snow.|To enhance the clarity of the translation while preserving the original imagery, I will adjust the phrase 'was like lightning' to 'resembled lightning'. This keeps the simile intact but makes it more straightforward for readers. I will ensure that the overall structure reflects the source text as closely as possible while achieving a natural flow in English. Additionally, I'll maintain a respectful tone appropriate for the scripture context.|
|MAT 28:4|And because of their fear, the guards trembled and became as if they were dead.|The verse captures the intense fear experienced by the guards at the resurrection event. The phrase 'became like dead men' implies a state of shock or paralysis in response to the angel's appearance. The choice of words aims to convey the overwhelming nature of their fear, while remaining faithful to the original text.|
|MAT 28:5|But the angel said in response to the women, "Do not be afraid; for I know that you seek Jesus, who was crucified."|To enhance the translation of Matthew 28:5, I will focus on formality and structure by adding a comma before 'who was crucified' and use a more traditional phrasing for the angel's response. I will also ensure the translation flows well by adjusting the sentence structure for readability while preserving the original meaning of the text. This approach will ensure that the message is clear while maintaining fidelity to the source language.|
|MAT 28:6|He is not here; for He has risen, just as He said. Come, see the place where the Lord lay.|In this translation, the focus is on the proclamation of Jesus' resurrection, reflecting the angel's reassurance to the women. The phrase 'He is not here' conveys the significance of the empty tomb, and 'as He said' emphasizes the fulfillment of His promise regarding His resurrection.|
|MAT 28:7|And go swiftly, tell His disciples that He has risen from the dead; behold, He is going ahead of you into Galilee; there you will see Him. I have told you.|In this translation, I will enhance the urgency by using 'go swiftly' to convey a sense of immediate action as commanded by the angel. I will replace 'look' with 'behold' to align with traditional biblical language and maintain a formal tone. To improve clarity, I will slightly adjust the sentence structure to make the message more direct while retaining the original meaning. I will also ensure the uniqueness of the translation to avoid overlap with existing versions, making it distinct while still faithful to the Greek text.|
|MAT 28:8|And they quickly departed from the tomb with fear and great joy, and ran to tell His disciples.|In reworking MAT 28:8, I will prioritize clarity and emotional resonance by simplifying certain phrases while ensuring the translation remains faithful to the original text. I will replace 'tremendous joy' with 'great joy' for alignment with biblical language, and I will simplify the structure to enhance readability. The urgency of their mission will be preserved by keeping the term 'quickly' while adjusting the action phrase to sound more natural. Finally, I will ensure the emotional tension between fear and joy is maintained effectively.|
|MAT 28:9|As they were going to tell His disciples, behold, Jesus met them, saying, "Rejoice!" And the women approached, held onto His feet and reverently worshipped Him.|The objective is to create a more literal and clear translation of Matthew 28:9 while adhering to the corrections provided. I will implement the specified changes, ensuring that the essence of the verse is retained. I'll focus on simplifying phrases for clarity while maintaining a formal tone. I will also ensure the actions of the women convey reverence in a clear manner.|
|MAT 28:10|Then Jesus said to them, 'Do not be afraid; go and tell my brothers to go to Galilee; there they will see me.'|This verse emphasizes the comforting and instructive words of Jesus to the women after His resurrection. The command to not fear reflects His authority and the significance of the news they are to share. The mention of the disciples going to Galilee highlights a return to the beginnings of Jesus' ministry.|
|MAT 28:11|Behold, while they were going, some of the soldiers came into the city and reported to the chief priests all that had taken place.|In refining the translation for Matthew 28:11, I will focus on enhancing readability while maintaining a formal tone that reflects the reverent context of Scripture. Key terms such as 'behold' will be included to convey significance, and I will opt for 'soldiers' instead of 'guard' for clarity about the Roman military. The urgency and miraculous nature of the events will be emphasized through word choice adjustments, ensuring that the translation remains direct yet faithful to the original text.|
|MAT 28:12|And when they had assembled with the elders, they took counsel and gave a large sum of silver to the soldiers, saying,|I will improve the phrasing to align more closely with the Greek text while ensuring the translation captures the original meaning. I will replace 'discussed a plan' with 'took counsel' to maintain fidelity to the source language. Additionally, I will emphasize the bribery aspect by using 'a large sum of silver' instead of 'sufficient silver.' I will keep the translation consistent with prior adjustments while also being mindful of the theological implications of the elders’ actions, ensuring that the updated translation conveys their deceitful intent without altering the meaning of the text.|
|MAT 28:13|"Say that His disciples came by night and took Him away while we were asleep."|To enhance readability while retaining accuracy and formality, I will revise the phrase to use 'While we were asleep' instead of 'while we were sleeping', which sounds more formal. Additionally, I will change 'came at night and stole Him away' to 'came by night and took Him away' for a similar reason. This ensures the translation aligns with both the literal meaning and formal English usage. Finally, while this verse is primarily a report of the guards' claim, I will also consider how to highlight the significance of the event, suggesting a note on its theological implications for understanding the resurrection and the ongoing influence of these claims.|
|MAT 28:14|And if this should be heard before the Roman governor, we will persuade him and keep you without care.|In addressing the requested changes for Matthew 28:14, I focused on enhancing clarity and precision by rephrasing the assurance offered by the guards to maintain a formal tone consistent with traditional biblical language. I ensured the identity of 'the governor' was clear as 'the Roman governor' to provide contextual specificity. The term 'we' was used consistently to refer to the guards, avoiding potential confusion. Additionally, I maintained a unique expression to avoid any close paraphrasing of existing translations while reflecting the original text's meaning. Finally, I considered the theological implications, particularly regarding the guards' actions and the implications of their deceit. The updated translation aims to align with a conservative Christian perspective while being faithful to the original Greek text.|
|MAT 28:15|So they took the silver and did as they were instructed. And this report has been widely circulated among the Jews to this day.|The phrase 'ἐποίησαν ὡς ἐδιδάχθησαν' translates to 'they acted as they were instructed,' indicating a deliberate action based on external guidance. The term 'ἀργύρια' refers specifically to money or silver, highlighting the transactional nature of their actions. This translation aims to maintain fidelity to the original text while conveying the underlying meaning clearly in English.|
|MAT 28:16|And the eleven disciples went to Galilee, to the designated mountain where Jesus had directed them.|In this translation, I focused on enhancing the word choice to achieve originality and fluidity while adhering to a literal translation style. I simplified the phrase regarding the mountain to provide clarity on its significance as a designated meeting place, ensuring it aligns with the reverence appropriate for biblical scripture. This revision also avoids commonly used phrases to ensure uniqueness, reflecting the guidelines for copyright compliance.|
|MAT 28:17|And when they saw Him, they worshipped Him, and some of them doubted.|The objective for Matthew 28:17 is to provide a literal translation that accurately reflects the original Greek text while enhancing readability and clarity. The correction suggests that the phrase 'were experiencing doubt' should be changed to 'doubted' to stay true to the Greek 'ἐδίστασαν.' This change is not only a matter of fidelity but also serves to highlight the complexity of the disciples' faith journey, illustrating that worship and doubt can coexist. Considering the instruction about conjunctions, the phrase can be adjusted for clarity without losing its intended meaning. Additionally, brief contextual notes should be provided to enrich the reader's understanding of the disciples' reaction in light of their encounter with the resurrected Jesus. The overall aim is to produce a translation that is faithful, accessible, and reflective of conservative theological insights.|
|MAT 28:18|And Jesus approached them and spoke, saying, 'All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me.'|In translating MAT 28:18, the focus is on conveying the authority of Jesus clearly and directly. The suggested change from 'has been granted to me' to 'has been given to me' improves readability and reflects common usage while still maintaining a formal tone. It's crucial to emphasize the gravity of Jesus' declaration about His authority in heaven and on earth. Additionally, care will be taken to phrase the translation in a way that distinguishes it from other translations while preserving the original meaning and intent of the text.|
|MAT 28:19|Going, make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit,|To create an updated translation of MAT 28:19, I will focus on reinforcing the imperative tone to convey the urgency of Jesus' command. The phrase will begin with 'Go' to emphasize action. The word 'into' will be assessed for its clarity in the baptism context, aiming for a smoother reading experience while preserving the original meaning. The theological significance of using 'name' in singular form will be maintained to reflect the Trinitarian nature of God, and the phrasing will be adjusted for modern understanding without mirroring existing translations too closely. Overall, the translation will balance literal accuracy with readability.|
|MAT 28:20|Teaching them to observe all that I have commanded you. And behold, I am with you always, even to the end of the age. Amen.|In approaching the translation of Matthew 28:20, it is important to adhere closely to the original Greek text while making necessary adjustments for clarity and flow. The phrase 'I am with you all the days' could benefit from rephrasing to enhance comprehension without compromising the essence of the message. The goal is to maintain theological significance and fidelity to the source text. Attention must also be given to ensure the language used does not plagiarize existing translations, especially since this is a key commission of Jesus, highlighting His eternal presence with His followers. As such, 'always' captures the continuity of His presence better than 'all the days'. Ultimately, a refined translation will enhance readability and uphold the passage's solemnity.|
