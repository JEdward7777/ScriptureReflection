| Reference | Verse | Translation Notes |
|:---------:|-------|-------------------|
|MAT 21:1|And as they approached Jerusalem, and came into the village of Bethphage at the Mount of Olives, then He sent two of His disciples.|To enhance clarity and contextual understanding in the translation of MAT 21:1, I will adjust the phrasing to specify that the event occurs in 'the village of Bethphage.' This helps provide geographical clarity. I will also replace 'Jesus' with 'He' to maintain formality consistent with traditional translations. Additionally, I will simplify the structure to improve readability while preserving the intended meaning. This will result in a translation that is both faithful to the original text and accessible for modern readers. Furthermore, I will acknowledge the significance of the Mount of Olives in biblical narratives, linking it subtly within the text where possible.|
|MAT 21:2|saying to them, 'Go into the village that is opposite you, and immediately you will find a donkey tied, and a colt with her; untie them and bring them to Me.'|In revising MAT 21:2, I will focus on enhancing clarity by rephrasing the description of the donkey and colt. I will also adjust the directive to untie them to ensure that the antecedent for 'them' is clear. The aim is to keep the translation literal while improving readability and maintaining fidelity to the original text. The changes will include clearer syntax, improved flow, and proper punctuation to meet the suggested corrections while retaining the meaning of the scripture.|
|MAT 21:3|And if anyone says anything to you, you shall say, 'The Lord has need of them'; and immediately he will send them.|In this verse, the phrase 'the Lord has need of it' emphasizes the authority of Jesus and His purpose in asking for the donkey and colt. The structure is kept straightforward to reflect the original Greek while ensuring clarity in English.|
|MAT 21:4|This all took place to fulfill what was spoken by the prophet Zechariah, saying.|In order to enhance the translation of MAT 21:4, I will clarify which prophet is referenced in the prophecy, ensuring it aligns with conservative Christian interpretations of Jesus fulfilling Old Testament prophecies. I will adjust the phrase structure slightly to improve readability while keeping the literal essence of the original text. This will also involve emphasizing the significance of prophecy fulfillment to enrich theological understanding without sacrificing the clarity of the message.|
|MAT 21:5|Say to the daughter of Zion, ‘Behold, your king is coming to you, gentle and riding on a donkey, on a colt, the foal of a donkey.’|This verse highlights the prophetic fulfillment of Jesus' entry into Jerusalem, symbolizing humility and the establishment of His kingship. The term 'daughter of Zion' is used to personify the city of Jerusalem, conveying both affection and the call for recognition of the coming king. The imagery of riding on a donkey speaks to peace and humility rather than conquest.|
|MAT 21:6|And the disciples went and did according to His command.|In re-evaluating MAT 21:6, I will focus on enhancing clarity and maintaining a formal tone, emphasizing the obedience of the disciples. I will also ensure the translation aligns closely with the original Greek while remaining accessible to contemporary readers. A direct rephrasing of 'as He commanded' to 'according to His command' will serve to simplify the language. Additionally, I will subtly restructure the sentence to highlight the action taken by the disciples as an immediate and deliberate response to Jesus' instructions.|
|MAT 21:7|They brought the donkey and the colt to Jesus, and they laid their cloaks upon the colt; and He sat upon it.|To achieve a literal and clear translation for MAT 21:7, I will clarify the subject of 'sat upon it' to ensure it is understood that it refers to Jesus sitting on the colt. I'll replace 'garments' with the more traditional 'cloaks' for familiarity in biblical language. I will also restructure the sentence slightly for better flow without adding embellishments. The goal is to keep the translation concise and focused on the essence of the original text.|
|MAT 21:8|And many in the crowd laid their cloaks on the road, while others cut branches from the trees and laid them along the way.|To create an improved translation for MAT 21:8, I will replace 'the majority of the crowd' with 'many in the crowd' to enhance readability. I'll use 'laid' instead of 'spreads' for a more dynamic verb that captures the action. I will ensure consistency by referring to 'the crowd' throughout, while clarifying the actions taken by different groups within that crowd. Furthermore, I will maintain the term 'many' in place of 'most' to closely reflect the original Greek word πλεῖστος, which emphasizes a significant number without implying an overwhelming majority. Overall, these adjustments will help in delivering a translation that is both literal and readable.|
|MAT 21:9|And the crowds that went before Him and those following were shouting, 'Hosanna to the Son of David! Blessed is He who comes in the name of the Lord! Hosanna in the highest!.'|The original translation for MAT 21:9 effectively captures the theological significance and emotional intensity of the crowd's response to Jesus. To enhance readability and faithfulness to the source text, I will maintain the overall message while restructuring some phrases for better flow. The repetitive nature in the original Greek can be emphasized in the English translation to reflect its rhythm. I will also consider the necessity of the footnote; however, it might be beneficial to remove it for a more straightforward, literal translation, leaving the explanation to a commentary.|
|MAT 21:10|And when he entered Jerusalem, the whole city was stirred, asking, 'Who is this?'|This translation aims to convey the atmosphere of excitement and inquiry surrounding Jesus' entry into Jerusalem, capturing the essence of the original Greek phrasing and the implications of the city's reaction.|
|MAT 21:11|And the crowds were saying, 'This is Jesus, the prophet from Nazareth of Galilee.'|This translation emphasizes the crowds' recognition of Jesus as a prophet, providing a direct response to the question posed in the previous verse. The structure and wording reflect the original Greek while ensuring clarity for contemporary readers.|
|MAT 21:12|And Jesus entered the temple of God and forcefully drove out all those who were selling and buying in the temple, and He overturned the tables of the money changers and the seats of those selling doves.|To ensure the translation of Matthew 21:12 accurately reflects the original Greek while enhancing clarity and emphasizing the significance of Jesus' actions, I'll incorporate minor stylistic improvements. I will also emphasize the authority of Jesus by using stronger descriptors. The goal is to maintain a balance between literal accuracy and the readability of the text, thereby avoiding plagiarism while respecting the theological implications of the narrative. This approach should align well with the conservative Christian perspective of the text.|
|MAT 21:13|And He said to them, 'It is written, ‘My house shall be called a house of prayer’; but you have made it a den of thieves.'|In addressing the requested corrections, I will first ensure that the phrase structure mirrors the original Greek more closely, particularly with the phrasing 'My house shall be called a house of prayer.' Additionally, I will substitute 'den of robbers' with 'den of thieves' to better reflect the original intent, as suggested. I will also maintain the authoritative tone of Jesus' statement while ensuring clarity and readability for the modern reader. Finally, I will clarify that 'My house' refers specifically to God's house, thus providing greater theological context without straying from the literal translation objective.|
|MAT 21:14|And the blind and the lame came to Him in the temple, and He healed them.|In this verse, the Greek words 'χωλοὶ' (lame) and 'τυφλοὶ' (blind) highlight the types of afflictions that Jesus addressed. The context emphasizes His compassion and ability to heal, demonstrating His authority and divine power in the temple setting.|
|MAT 21:15|But when the chief priests and the scribes saw the wonderful works that He performed, and the children shouting in the temple and saying, 'Hosanna to the Son of David!' they became angry.|The goal is to refine the translation of Matthew 21:15 by considering word choice, emotional clarity, and contextual emphasis while ensuring it remains literal and faithful to the original Greek text. 'Miraculous works' will be replaced with 'wonderful works' to maintain a more traditional tone. The phrase 'filled with indignation' will be changed to 'became angry' for clarity in conveying the chief priests' emotional response. Additionally, I'll highlight the significance of the children's shouts to reflect their prophetic role. Finally, I'll ensure that the revised translation flows well and is easy to read, without losing the essence of the original text.|
|MAT 21:16|And they said to Him, 'Do You hear what these are saying?' Jesus replied, 'Yes, have you never read this: "Out of the mouths of infants and nursing babies, You have perfected praise?"'|To revise MAT 21:16, I will focus on improving the phrasing for clarity and readability while ensuring it aligns with traditional interpretations of scripture. I will replace 'You have ordained praise' with 'You have perfected praise', as it captures a deeper theological meaning. I will also maintain the quotation formatting to ensure clarity that these words are part of a scriptural citation. The overall structure of the sentence will be adjusted for fluidity, but I will keep the direct reference consistent with the original text. Lastly, I will consider including a brief contextual note to help the reader understand the significance of the verse within the passage, all while maintaining a conservative Christian perspective.|
|MAT 21:17|And leaving them, He went out of the city to Bethany and spent the night there.|The Greek word 'καταλιπὼν' implies leaving or forsaking, indicating a deliberate departure. 'εἰς Βηθανίαν' specifically names the destination, Bethany, which has significance in the Gospels as a place of rest and hospitality for Jesus. The phrase 'ηὐλίσθη ἐκεῖ' suggests He took refuge or camped, indicating a temporary stay rather than a permanent dwelling. This reflects Jesus' lifestyle of movement and reliance on others for hospitality.|
|MAT 21:18|Early in the morning, as He was returning to the city, He became hungry.|In this verse, the term 'ἐπείνασε' (epeinasen) is used, which directly translates to 'He was hungry.' This expression emphasizes Jesus' physical need for sustenance after a night of rest and traveling. The context of hunger is significant in the narrative, indicating His humanity and connection to the needs of people.|
|MAT 21:19|And seeing a fig tree by the road, He approached it, but found nothing on it except leaves. And He said to it, 'May you never bear fruit again!' Immediately, the fig tree withered away.|This verse emphasizes the theme of fruitfulness, a concept prevalent in the Bible symbolizing spiritual health and productivity. The phrase 'Let no fruit grow on you ever again' illustrates the finality of judgment against unfruitfulness. The choice of the verb 'withered' conveys a sudden and irreversible action, reflective of divine authority over creation.|
|MAT 21:20|And when the disciples saw it, they marveled, saying, 'How did the fig tree wither away immediately?'|In revising Matthew 21:20, I aim to enhance clarity and precision while ensuring that the translation remains faithful to the original Greek text. The feedback suggests replacing 'so soon' with 'immediately' to more accurately reflect the term 'παραχρῆμα,' thus emphasizing the miraculous nature of the event. Additionally, I will maintain the existing structure to keep the disciples' expressions of amazement intact, ensuring the translation aligns with conservative Christian beliefs regarding the miraculous acts of Jesus.|
|MAT 21:21|But Jesus answered them, 'I assure you, if you have faith and do not waver, you will not only do what was done to the fig tree, but if you say to this mountain with faith, 'Be taken up and thrown into the sea,' it will happen.'|To address the suggested corrections for MAT 21:21, I will incorporate the phrasing adjustments to emphasize faith as the source of power when speaking to the mountain. The intent is to highlight the believer's relationship with God and the importance of unwavering faith. I will also enhance the directness of Jesus' statement and use terminology consistent with traditional biblical language. This will provide a more theologically rich translation that is accessible to conservative Christian audiences.|
|MAT 21:22|And whatever you ask in prayer, believing, you will receive.|In this translation, the focus is on the assurance of receiving what is asked for in prayer, emphasizing the importance of faith as a prerequisite. The Greek verb 'αιτήσητε' (ask) has been preserved to reflect the direct request made in prayer. The phrase 'πιστεύοντες' (believing) underscores the necessity of faith when approaching God in prayer, which is a common theme in biblical teachings regarding prayer and faith.|
|MAT 21:23|And when He entered the temple, the chief priests and the elders of the people approached Him as He was teaching, asking, 'By what authority are You doing these things? And who granted You this authority?'|In revising Matthew 21:23, the objective is to ensure the translation is both literal and clear while avoiding plagiarism. A contextual introduction is included to specify who is speaking, which enhances understanding. Adjustments in punctuation and conjunction usage are made for clarity and flow, keeping in mind the theme of authority which is central to this passage. The translation will reflect the original Greek while remaining accessible to the reader, providing a straightforward representation of the text's intent.|
|MAT 21:24|Jesus replied to them, 'I will pose one question to you; if you answer me, I will tell you by what authority I am doing these things.'|To enhance clarity and readability, I will refine the phrasing of the verse while maintaining its original meaning. I'll adopt a more formal tone that underscores Jesus’ authority, ensuring that the nuances related to His authority are explicitly conveyed. I will simplify certain phrases for contemporary understanding and ensure unique phrasing to avoid plagiarism. I will also restructure the sentence slightly for better flow and coherence.|
|MAT 21:25|"From where does the baptism of John come? From heaven or from people?" They deliberated among themselves, saying, "If we say, 'From heaven,' He will ask us, 'Then why did you not believe him?'"|In revising the translation of MAT 21:25, I will aim to enhance clarity and flow while keeping a formal tone that suits biblical texts. I will replace 'men' with 'people' to reflect modern understanding and ensure consistency in terminology. Additionally, I will subtly emphasize the theological implications of John's baptism as it relates to Jesus' authority, without altering the original meaning. Punctuation will be refined for improved readability, especially in dialogue. Overall, the goal is to create a straightforward and respectful translation that is accessible to contemporary readers while being faithful to the original text.|
|MAT 21:26|And if we say, 'From men,' we are afraid of the crowd, for all consider John to be a prophet.|To effectively address the requested corrections for MAT 21:26, I will rephrase the translation to emphasize both the fear of the leaders and the public's respect for John. I will use 'we are afraid of the crowd' for a more nuanced emotional expression and slightly modify the ending to convey consensus regarding John's prophetic status. Additionally, I will ensure the language maintains a traditional biblical style to resonate with a conservative audience. I will also consider adding a footnote for context on the cultural dynamics at play, enhancing the understanding of the leaders' fear of the crowd's opinion.|
|MAT 21:27|And they answered Jesus, 'We do not know.' Jesus then replied to them, 'Neither will I disclose to you by what authority I am performing these deeds.'|To translate MAT 21:27, I will ensure that I closely follow the original Greek while enhancing the clarity and formality of the language. I will reflect on the authority of Jesus and the skepticism of the religious leaders to provide context. Additionally, I will strive for engagement with contemporary readers without copying from existing translations.|
|MAT 21:28|"What do you think? A certain man had two sons, and he went to the first and said, 'Son, go work in my vineyard today.'" <br><br>*Footnote: In biblical culture, vineyards were not only vital for agricultural production but also held deep symbolic meaning, often representing God's kingdom and the work required within it.*|To address the corrections for MAT 21:28, I will adjust the opening phrase to a more conversational style that reflects the original Greek tone. I will also ensure that the translation remains faithful to the source while making minor adjustments for clarity and natural flow. To fulfill the cultural context aspect, I will include a footnote discussing the significance of vineyards in biblical times. Overall, the focus will be on maintaining consistency in verb tenses and phrasing throughout the translation, while prioritizing accuracy and clarity.|
|MAT 21:29|But he answered, 'I will not.' Yet later, having changed his mind, he went to work in the vineyard.|In this task, the objective is to create an updated translation of Matthew 21:29 that remains faithful to the original Greek while enhancing clarity and flow. The verse needs to capture the son's initial refusal with 'I will not' but may also benefit from a slight emphasis on his ultimate decision to repent. By incorporating the notion of 'changed his mind' alongside 'repented,' I can convey the transformation in the son's attitude. To improve the flow, I will rephrase the sentence while ensuring that it indicates the outcome of his actions—going to work in the vineyard. Finally, I'll make minor adjustments to the phrasing for better readability while maintaining the original meaning.|
|MAT 21:30|And going to the second son, he said the same thing. The son replied, 'I will, Lord,' but he did not go.|I will focus on making the translation more readable while maintaining its faithfulness to the Greek text. The goal is to improve clarity by simplifying certain phrases without altering their meaning. I will also ensure the translation reflects a conservative Christian understanding and avoids closely resembling other translations.|
|MAT 21:31|"Which of the two did the will of his father?" They replied, "The first." Jesus said to them, "Amen, I say to you, that tax collectors and prostitutes are going into the kingdom of God before you."|To create an updated translation of MAT 21:31, I will ensure to maintain the phrase 'Amen, I say to you' for traditional emphasis while enhancing clarity and readability. I will retain 'tax collectors and prostitutes' for theological significance, ensure sentence flow is improved, and highlight the shocking nature of Jesus' remarks against the backdrop of the religious leaders' expectations. This approach will respect both the literal translation requirement and the emphasis on traditional interpretation while avoiding plagiarism. Additionally, I will ensure the tone is polished and formal, suitable for a biblical text.|
|MAT 21:32|For John came to you in the way of righteousness, and you did not believe him; but the tax collectors and prostitutes believed him. And even after seeing this, you did not repent and believe him.|In addressing the translation of MAT 21:32, I will ensure that key theological terms such as 'repent' and 'believe' are used appropriately to reflect conservative Christian values. The sentence will be restructured for clarity, avoiding vague language and enhancing the overall readability of the passage. I will also emphasize the contrast between the faith of the tax collectors and prostitutes and the disbelief of the religious leaders to underscore the message. I will keep the original meaning intact while improving sentence flow and structure. Additionally, I will ensure that the theological implications of the text are preserved throughout the translation process.|
|MAT 21:33|"Hear another parable: There was a certain owner of a vineyard who planted a vineyard, enclosed it, dug a winepress in it, and built a tower. Then he entrusted it to farmers and went away."|In this update for MAT 21:33, the aim is to create a translation that is both faithful to the Greek text and readable for modern audiences. I will implement the suggested adjustments while ensuring that the original meaning is preserved. Using 'owner of the vineyard' provides clearer contextual understanding. The phrasing 'Hear another parable' conveys a sense of urgency and is retained for emphasis. I will adjust the sentence structure slightly for better flow and readability, while ensuring that it remains distinct from other translations to avoid plagiarism. I also aim to maintain the theological significance and cultural nuances embedded in the text without altering its core message.|
|MAT 21:34|When the time for the harvest drew near, he sent his servants to the tenants to collect his fruit.|This verse illustrates the expectation of the vineyard owner for the tenants to produce fruit, reflecting God's desire for His people to yield good works. The use of 'sent' signifies authority and the intention of claiming what is due. The terms used, such as 'servants' and 'fruit,' resonate with themes of stewardship and accountability found throughout Scripture.|
|MAT 21:35|And the tenants took his servants; they beat one, killed another, and stoned a third.|The original translation of MAT 21:35 captures the main idea of the verse accurately. However, to improve clarity and align with traditional biblical interpretations, I'll replace 'farmers' with 'tenants' to enhance the metaphorical aspect of the parable. Additionally, I'll refine the phrasing to ensure smoother readability while maintaining the original intent. This will involve restructuring the actions of the servants to be more concise. I will also consider the symbolic implications of these actions and possibly add a brief contextual note to provide deeper understanding. Overall, the goal is to create a translation that is faithful, readable, and aligns with the traditional understanding of the text.|
|MAT 21:36|Again, he sent more servants than the first, and they treated them in the same way.|To enhance the clarity and fluidity of MAT 21:36 while capturing the nuances of the original Greek text, I will consider synonyms that improve readability without losing the original meaning. I aim to ensure that the translation reflects the authoritative nature of the master sending the servants. This involves selecting words that underscore the persistence of the master's attempts to communicate with the tenants and the seriousness of their rejection.|
|MAT 21:37|Afterward, he sent his son to them, saying, 'They will respect my son.'|In revising Matthew 21:37, I will prioritize clarity and accessibility while remaining true to the original Greek text. To reflect the nuance of 'ἐντραπήσονται', I will use 'respect' to capture the essence of honoring the son, which also highlights the theological significance of sonship in this parable. Additionally, I'll substitute 'later' with 'afterward' to elevate the tone. I will ensure the translation aligns with the intended goals and avoids any rejected phrases or concepts. Overall, the focus will be on making the verse more meaningful and theologically rich, reflecting the context of the son being sent as a significant figure in God's narrative.|
|MAT 21:38|But when the farmers saw the son, they said to one another, 'This is the heir; come, let us kill him and seize his inheritance.'|This verse highlights the rejection of the son by the tenants, emphasizing the themes of inheritance and rejection that are central to the parable. The term 'heir' is used to denote the status of the son, while 'kill' conveys the intent of the husbandmen.|
|MAT 21:39|And they took him, threw him out of the vineyard, and killed him.|In this verse, the actions of the farmers symbolize the rejection and mistreatment of the Son, representing Jesus Himself. The choice of the words 'threw him out' and 'killed him' emphasizes the violent rejection and the seriousness of their actions.|
|MAT 21:40|Therefore, when the lord of the vineyard comes, what will he do to those farmers?|In addressing the peer review comments for Matthew 21:40, I will prioritize readability by adjusting the phrasing to improve flow. I will also consider word choice, replacing 'tenants' with 'farmers' to enhance relatability, while emphasizing the authority of 'the lord' to clarify the theological implications of this verse. Additionally, I'll adopt a more formal tone to align with the biblical text style. Lastly, I will consider the inclusion of footnotes to provide context for readers unfamiliar with the parable's significance, ensuring a richer understanding of the text without altering its meaning.|
|MAT 21:41|They said to Him, 'He will bring ruin upon those wicked men and give the vineyard to other farmers, who will render to Him the fruits in their seasons.'|The primary objective is to ensure that the translation of MAT 21:41 closely aligns with the original Greek while enhancing clarity and maintaining a formal tone. The first step involves replacing 'He will destroy those wicked men' with a more literal rendering, such as 'bring ruin upon those wicked men', which retains the meaning of destruction but adds gravity. Next, changing 'give the vineyard to other tenants' to 'give the vineyard to other farmers' reflects the original Greek term more accurately. Lastly, the phrase 'who will give Him the fruits at their proper times' needs to emphasize responsibility; thus, rephrasing it to 'who will render to Him the fruits in their seasons' fulfills this requirement. This revision respects the original intent while providing clarity and formal tone consistent with traditional biblical language.|
|MAT 21:42|Jesus said to them, 'Have you never read in the Scriptures: The stone which the builders rejected has become the cornerstone? This was the Lord's doing, and it is marvelous in our eyes?'|To address the given corrections while maintaining a literal translation approach, I will ensure that key phrases are preserved in their original context and meaning. I will rephrase terms for clarity and modern understanding where necessary, particularly with 'head of the corner' becoming 'cornerstone' and modifying 'This has come to be from the Lord' to 'This was the Lord's doing.' Additionally, I will retain the authoritative tone in the opening question to keep the impact of the original statement. Finally, I'll work to enhance the overall clarity and flow while keeping the theological depth intact, ensuring all corrections are integrated smoothly.|
|MAT 21:43|"Therefore, I say to you that the kingdom of God will be taken away from you and given to a people who will produce its fruits."|In revising Matthew 21:43, I aim to incorporate the suggested terminology adjustments while maintaining a formal biblical tone. Replacing 'nations' with 'Gentiles' allows for clarity regarding the original audience and its implications in the broader biblical context. The phrase structure will be enhanced to flow more naturally, while ensuring it remains a literal translation that is true to the Greek text. I will also consider the theological implications of the verse, providing a concise commentary that highlights its significance within the narrative of the parable and the broader themes of judgment and grace.|
|MAT 21:44|And the one who falls upon this stone will be broken; but on whomever it falls, it will grind him to powder.|To improve the translation of MAT 21:44, I will ensure clarity and fluidity in the phrase describing the consequences of falling upon the stone. I will also maintain literal fidelity to the Greek text while providing a unique expression to avoid plagiarism. Furthermore, I will consider the theological implications of 'the stone' in relation to Christ as the cornerstone, ensuring that the updated translation reflects the severity of the original text without deviating from traditional terminology.|
|MAT 21:45|And when the chief priests and the Pharisees heard His parables, they realized that He was referring to them.|To enhance clarity and readability while maintaining a literal translation of the Greek text, I will adjust the phrasing of MAT 21:45. The goal is to convey the priests' realization in a way that reflects both their understanding and the weight of judgment implied in the parable. I will also ensure that the translation closely aligns with the source without deviating significantly from the original meaning.|
|MAT 21:46|And they sought to seize Him, but they feared the multitude, since they held Him as a prophet.|In reviewing MAT 21:46, I want to maintain a formal tone while accurately conveying the urgency of the situation faced by the religious leaders. By choosing synonyms that reflect the intensity of their desire to apprehend Jesus, and elevating the language regarding the crowd, I can ensure a translation that honors the original text. Furthermore, I will incorporate a more literal structure to align with the Greek syntax and reflect their recognition of Jesus as a prophet more firmly. This requires careful word choice and phrasing to avoid overly familiar language.|
