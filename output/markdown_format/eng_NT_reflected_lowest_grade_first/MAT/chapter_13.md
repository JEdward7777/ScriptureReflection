| Reference | Verse | Translation Notes |
|:---------:|-------|-------------------|
|MAT 13:1|In that day, Jesus went out of His house and sat by the sea.|In addressing the requested corrections for MAT 13:1, I will ensure that the translation maintains a literal approach while clarifying certain aspects as suggested. The phrase 'On that day' will be changed to 'In that day' to reflect the original Greek term 'ἐκείνῃ'. Additionally, I will specify 'His house' to indicate possession and connection to Jesus. The term 'the Sea of Galilee' will be simplified to 'the sea' to align more closely with the original text. I will also be mindful to establish context appropriately without excessive detail that could confuse the reader. Overall, these adjustments will strive for clarity while remaining faithful to the source text.|
|MAT 13:2|And great crowds gathered around Him, so that He got into a boat and sat down, while all the people stood on the shore.|In this translation, the emphasis is on the large gathering of people and the action of Jesus sitting down to teach. The word 'crowds' captures the multitude, while 'boat' denotes the vessel into which Jesus enters. The phrase 'by the shore' specifies the location of the crowd's gathering, akin to other verses where Jesus teaches from a boat or elevated place.|
|MAT 13:3|And He spoke to them many things in parables, saying: "Behold, a sower went out to sow."|In this translation, I emphasize the act of speaking and the nature of parables as a teaching tool used by Jesus. The phrase 'the sower' directly connects with agricultural imagery, which was familiar to the audience of the time.|
|MAT 13:4|And as he sowed, some seeds fell along the path, and the birds came and devoured them.|To achieve a literal translation of MAT 13:4 while also ensuring clarity and fluidity in modern English, I will rephrase 'by the wayside' to 'along the path.' This modification will improve comprehension for contemporary readers. Additionally, substituting 'consumed' with 'devoured' will reflect the intensity of the original Greek word 'κατέφαγεν' while adhering to traditional Biblical language. The adjustments will maintain the structure and avoid direct plagiarism from other translations.|
|MAT 13:5|Other seeds fell on rocky ground, where there was not much soil, and immediately sprang up because it had no depth of soil.|In revising MAT 13:5, I will enhance clarity by specifying 'because it had no depth of soil' instead of the more vague phrase 'due to the lack of depth'. This change emphasizes the reason for the immediate growth of the seeds. I will also replace 'immediately they sprang up' with 'immediately sprang up' to convey urgency without altering the meaning. To improve fluidity, I will keep the structure close to the original Greek while ensuring that it is still readable and relatable to a conservative audience familiar with traditional agricultural terms. Overall, these adjustments aim to provide a clear, immediate, and familiar translation that remains faithful to the source text.|
|MAT 13:6|But when the sun had risen, they were burned by the heat; and because they had no root, they withered away.|To enhance the translation of MAT 13:6 while remaining faithful to the original Greek, I will implement several suggested changes. First, I will maintain literal fidelity by using a phrase like 'when the sun had risen' to reflect the original syntax more closely. Next, I will intensify the language to depict the severity of the sun's effect by stating 'were burned by the heat.' Lastly, I will ensure that the tone is formal to align with the gravity of the biblical text while keeping clarity and readability in mind. This will result in a translation that accurately reflects both the meaning and the weight of the passage.|
|MAT 13:7|Others fell among the thorns, and the thorns sprang up and choked them.|To enhance the clarity and imagery of the translation for MAT 13:7, I will adjust the wording as suggested. By using 'fell among the thorns', it will create a more vivid picture for the reader. Additionally, changing 'grew up' to 'sprang up' will improve the flow and readability of the sentence, aligning it better with contemporary English. My goal is to maintain the literal accuracy of the original Greek while making the translation engaging for modern audiences.|
|MAT 13:8|But others fell on the good soil and yielded fruit: some a hundredfold, some sixty, and some thirty.|In this verse, the emphasis is on the type of soil and the resulting fruit, indicating different yields of productivity. The 'good soil' metaphorically represents receptive hearts that bear varying degrees of fruitfulness, showing God's sovereignty and grace in producing results in believers' lives.|
|MAT 13:9|Whoever has ears to hear, let him hear.|To create a translation of MAT 13:9 that maintains fidelity to the original text while also reflecting the feedback from the peer review, I will simplify the phrase 'possesses ears to hear' to 'has ears to hear' for clarity. Additionally, I will change 'let him listen attentively' to 'let him hear' to align more closely with traditional biblical language. This combination aims to achieve a balance between literal translation and accessibility while maintaining theological integrity.|
|MAT 13:10|Then the disciples approached Him and asked, 'Why do You speak to them using parables?'|To improve MAT 13:10, I will focus on enhancing clarity and flow by restructuring the sentence to make it more readable while maintaining a formal tone. I will also ensure that the translation remains distinct by using phrasing that captures the original intent without mimicking existing translations. Additionally, I'll simplify the language slightly to ensure accessibility while honoring the reverence of the text. The adjustments will reflect the disciples' confusion about the use of parables and emphasize the uniqueness of Jesus' teaching style. Overall, the goal is to present a translation that is clear, original, and engaging for modern readers.|
|MAT 13:11|He answered them, 'To you it has been granted to understand the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, but to them it has not been granted.'|In this verse, the focus is on the divine prerogative to grant understanding of the mysteries of the kingdom to certain individuals. This reflects the theme of revelation that runs throughout the New Testament, emphasizing that comprehension of spiritual truths is a gift from God.|
|MAT 13:12|For to the one who has, more will be given, and he will have an abundance; but from the one who does not have, even what he thinks he has will be taken away.|This verse highlights a principle of abundance and scarcity regarding understanding and possession. It underscores that those who are receptive and open to understanding will receive even more, whereas those who are closed off or unresponsive will find what little they have taken away.|
|MAT 13:13|Therefore, I speak to them in parables, because seeing, they do not perceive, and hearing, they do not understand.|In revising MAT 13:13, I will focus on simplifying the language while maintaining a formal tone that is consistent with traditional translations. I will eliminate redundancy by choosing either 'understand' or 'comprehend' to enhance clarity and conciseness. Additionally, I will consider the nuances of the original Greek text to ensure precision in word choice and strive to preserve the spiritual resonance of Christ's teachings. The revised translation will reflect a more modern yet respectful approach to the text, aiming to be accessible for contemporary readers without losing the original meaning.|
|MAT 13:14|And in them is fulfilled the prophecy of Isaiah, saying: 'You will hear but not comprehend, and you will look but not perceive.'|In order to enhance clarity and fluidity, I will adjust the phrasing of the prophecy to make it sound more natural in English. Additionally, I will change 'which says:' to 'saying:' to emphasize the authority of the prophecy being fulfilled. I'll also ensure that the translation remains faithful to the original text by keeping a literal translation while refining the language for readability. It's important to convey the context of Jesus' explanation leading to the prophecy to deepen the understanding for the reader. By carefully balancing these elements, the updated translation will aim to be both engaging and faithful to the source text.|
|MAT 13:15|For the heart of this people has grown dull, and with their ears they have become dull of hearing, and they have closed their eyes; lest they should see with their eyes and hear with their ears and understand with their heart and turn, and I will heal them.|To fulfill the correction directives for MAT 13:15, I will prioritize maintaining fidelity to the original Greek text while also enhancing clarity and readability. I will adopt terminology that accurately reflects the original meanings, such as using 'made dull' instead of 'hardened' and 'dull of hearing' in place of 'difficult to hear.' Furthermore, I will modify the phrase concerning divine action from 'I will restore them' to 'I will heal them' to emphasize God's initiative. The urgency of the text will be captured by substituting 'may see' with 'lest they should see.' To achieve cohesion and flow, I will simplify complex phrases and avoid awkward constructions, aiming for a translation that resonates well within a conservative Christian framework.|
|MAT 13:16|But blessed are your eyes, for they see; and your ears, for they hear.|In revising MAT 13:16, I need to maintain a literal translation while considering the provided corrections. The focus should be on ensuring that the essence of the original Greek is preserved, particularly in the latter part of the verse. I will eliminate redundancy by rephrasing the section about perception and understanding, making it more straightforward. The revised translation should clearly convey the spiritual significance of the blessing without mirroring existing translations. I will strive for clarity and coherence, ultimately resulting in a translation that aligns closely with the Greek text while remaining accessible to contemporary readers.|
|MAT 13:17|Truly, I say to you, many prophets and righteous people longed to see what you see, and did not see it, and to hear what you hear, and did not hear it.|This verse emphasizes the privilege of the disciples in witnessing the fulfillment of the prophetic words that others had longed to see. The focus is on the blessedness of their experience and the historical longing of past prophets and righteous individuals.|
|MAT 13:18|Therefore, listen to the parable of the sower.|To enhance the translation of MAT 13:18, I will adopt the recommendations provided by reviewers. I will rephrase 'hear the meaning of the parable of the sower' to 'listen to the parable of the sower' to reflect a more literal understanding of the original Greek text and emphasize the act of listening. This aligns with the aim of making the translation both accurate and resonant theologically. I will also maintain consistency with traditional terms, ensuring that the translation remains accessible while prioritizing fidelity to the original language.|
|MAT 13:19|When anyone hears the message of the kingdom and does not grasp it, the evil one comes and snatches away what was sown in his heart. This is the seed sown along the path.|The phrase 'the evil one' refers specifically to Satan, who is active in thwarting the reception of God's word. 'The seed sown in the heart' denotes the word of God that is intended to take root and bear fruit, but fails to do so because of a lack of understanding.|
|MAT 13:20|But the one sown on rocky ground is the one who hears the word and receives it immediately with joy.|The aim is to revise the translation of MAT 13:20 to enhance clarity and precision while maintaining fidelity to the original text. I will simplify the phrase 'immediately receives it with joy' by focusing on the subject's emotional response without redundancy. I will also ensure that the structure of the sentence flows better by reintroducing the use of 'who' to clarify who is taking action. Care will be taken to avoid any interpretive additions or alterations that deviate from the original meaning.|
|MAT 13:21|But he has no root in himself; he is temporary, and when tribulation or persecution arises because of the word, he stumbles immediately.|To produce an updated translation of MAT 13:21, I will take into account the corrections suggested by my teachers. First, I will replace 'shallow' with 'temporary' to accurately convey the meaning of 'πρόσκαιρός.' Next, I will alter 'falls away immediately' to 'he stumbles immediately' to better represent 'σκανδαλίζεται.' Lastly, I will ensure that the translation maintains a clear connection between the lack of root and the resulting reaction to tribulation or persecution, while remaining consistent with a conservative Christian perspective.|
|MAT 13:22|But the one sown among thorns, this is the one who hears the word; and the worries of this life and the deceitfulness of riches choke the word, and he becomes unfruitful.|To enhance the translation of MAT 13:22, I will incorporate the suggested improvements while ensuring the language remains clear and accessible to modern readers. By replacing 'allure' with 'deceitfulness,' the translation will align more closely with traditional interpretations and convey a more precise theological meaning. Additionally, I will review the overall structure to ensure smoothness and coherence, allowing for easier comprehension without losing the depth of the original text. The focus remains on portraying the spiritual implications of worldly distractions as illustrated in the parable, ensuring it resonates with conservative Christian values.|
|MAT 13:23|But the one sown on good soil, this is the one who listens to the word and comprehends it; he indeed produces fruit, yielding a hundredfold, some sixty, and some thirty.|To ensure fidelity to the original text, I will focus on translating the key elements while also using synonyms to avoid repetition. Enhancing the literary flow is essential, so I will adjust awkward phrases for smoother reading. Additionally, I will consider theological implications to deepen understanding without adding commentary that diverges from the text. Consistency in terminology is vital, so I will maintain a cohesive use of key biblical terms. Care will be taken to ensure the final translation is distinct from existing versions to uphold originality.|
|MAT 13:24|He presented to them a parable, saying: 'The Kingdom of Heaven is like a man who sowed good seed in his field.'|In revising MAT 13:24, I will focus on enhancing the introduction's flow by removing the redundancy of 'another parable' while retaining the core message of the text. I will ensure the translation adheres closely to the original syntax to maintain a literal approach. Furthermore, I will eliminate the explanatory note at the end to align with the directive for strict fidelity to the text. By streamlining the phrasing, the translation will achieve clarity while honoring the source material's integrity.|
|MAT 13:25|But while they were sleeping, his enemy came and sowed tares among the wheat, and went away. [Footnote: Tares are a type of weed that resembles wheat.]|In refining MAT 13:25, I will prioritize terminology consistency by using 'tares' in place of 'weeds' to stay true to traditional biblical language. I'll adjust the phrasing from 'while men were asleep' to 'while they were sleeping' to enhance readability and ensure smoothness. I will keep the explanatory footnote on 'tares' to aid understanding without compromising the formal nature of the translation. Lastly, minor stylistic enhancements will be incorporated to maintain the original meaning while improving flow.|
|MAT 13:26|When the wheat sprouted and produced grain, then the weeds also appeared.|This verse emphasizes the visible result of the sowing process. The word ‘weeds’ (ζιζάνια) denotes the intrusive plants that grow among the good crop, revealing the coexistence of good and evil until the time of harvest. The structure aims to capture the tension between the growth of the wheat and the appearance of the weeds as a central theme in the parable.|
|MAT 13:27|Then the servants of the master came to him, saying, 'Lord, did you not sow good seed in your field? Where then did these tares come from?' [Footnote: Tares symbolize false believers or corruption that can arise in a community of faith.]|To revise MAT 13:27, I will follow the correction points provided. First, I will maintain 'Lord' to reflect reverence in the translation. Then, I will use 'tares' instead of 'weeds' to align with traditional interpretations. The term 'the servants of the Lord' will be adjusted back to 'the servants of the master' for a more literal translation, as the Greek term is better reflected this way. Additionally, I will enhance the footnote to clarify the symbolism of 'tares' while avoiding interpretive commentary. I will ensure that the final phrasing captures the urgency of the servants' inquiry, thus emphasizing the gravity of the situation while keeping the structure coherent and grammatically fluid. Overall, the updated translation will be literal yet readable, capturing the intended meanings and contexts accurately.|
|MAT 13:28|But he replied to them, 'An enemy has done this.' The servants then asked him, 'Do you want us to go and gather them up?'|In light of the peer reviews, I will focus on enhancing the fluency and readability of the translation for MAT 13:28 while maintaining the accuracy of the original Greek text. I will clarify the dialogue by explicitly mentioning 'enemy' in the response from the servants to improve the context. The phrase 'the servants then said to him' will be rephrased for a smoother transition. This approach ensures that the translation remains faithful to the source while improving its clarity and overall readability.|
|MAT 13:29|But he said, 'No, so that in gathering the weeds, you do not uproot the wheat along with them.' [Footnote: 'Weeds' refers to 'tares', a type of weed that resembles wheat and symbolizes false believers or corruption in the community of faith.]|In revising MAT 13:29, I aim to incorporate the theological implications of the wheat and tares metaphor, particularly its significance regarding judgment and discernment. The language will be adjusted for modern comprehension, replacing 'lest' with 'so that' to clarify meaning while maintaining theological integrity. Consistency in terminology will be ensured by defining 'tares' in the footnote, while 'weeds' will be considered for clarity. Adjustments to sentence structure will be made to enhance overall readability and flow without sacrificing the literal meaning. I will include a footnote to clarify the meaning of 'tares' and how it relates to the context, ensuring it is not redundant but provides valuable insights to the reader.|
|MAT 13:30|Let both grow together until the harvest, and at the time of the harvest, I will say to the reapers: ‘First gather the weeds and bind them in bundles to be burned, but gather the wheat into my barn.'|This verse is part of a parable where Jesus explains the coexistence of good and evil until the final judgment. The imagery of gathering and burning reflects the ultimate separation of the righteous from the wicked at the time of harvest.|
|MAT 13:31|He told them another parable: 'The Kingdom of Heaven is like a mustard seed, which a man took and sowed in his field; it is the smallest of all seeds, but when it has grown, it is larger than all the garden plants and becomes a tree, so that the birds of the air come and nest in its branches.'|The objective is to create a literal and faithful translation of Matthew 13:31 that also addresses the instructions provided for clarity, metaphorical significance, readability, contextual depth, avoidance of redundancy, and theological integrity. To begin, I will rephrase 'which a man took and planted in his field' to 'which a man took and sowed in his field' to align with biblical terminology. Additionally, I will emphasize the contrast between the small size of the mustard seed and its large growth to highlight the metaphorical significance of the Kingdom of Heaven. I will restructure the latter part of the sentence to improve clarity and flow while maintaining theological accuracy. Brief contextual notes can be considered separately but for the text, I will keep it straightforward without over-explaining, ensuring a conservative interpretation is upheld.|
|MAT 13:32|which is the smallest of all seeds; but when it has grown, it is larger than all the garden plants and becomes a tree, so that the birds of the air come and make nests in its branches.|This verse emphasizes the contrasting nature of the mustard seed, illustrating how something small can grow to greatness. The metaphor relates to the Kingdom of Heaven, showing its humble beginnings and expansive potential.|
|MAT 13:33|He spoke another parable to them: "The Kingdom of Heaven is like yeast that a woman took and hid in three measures of flour, until it was all leavened."|In this verse, the imagery of leaven (or yeast) is used to illustrate how the Kingdom of Heaven permeates and transforms everything it touches, much like leaven influences dough. The number three, used here, represents completeness or fullness, enhancing the idea that the Kingdom of Heaven is fully capable of transforming the world.|
|MAT 13:34|"Jesus spoke all these things to the crowds in parables; and without a parable, He did not speak to them." 

*Footnote: This verse highlights the critical role of parables in Jesus' ministry, serving as a means to convey deep truths about the Kingdom of Heaven in accessible language.|I will adopt a more formal tone in the translation to align with traditional biblical language. To improve readability, I'll restructure the clause about parables for better flow. The significance of parables in Jesus' teaching will be emphasized, and I will craft a footnote that succinctly underscores their importance. Additionally, I'll strive for clarity and conciseness in the phrasing while retaining the original meaning. The footnote will be informative yet not overshadow the main text.|
|MAT 13:35|so that what was spoken through the prophet might be fulfilled, saying: 'I will open my mouth in parables; I will proclaim things hidden since the foundation of the world.'|In this translation, the phrase 'that which was spoken' is emphasized to reflect the prophetic nature of Jesus' teachings, echoing the style of Old Testament prophecies. The term 'in parables' has been retained to underscore the method Jesus used to convey deeper truths, while 'from the foundation of the world' connects to the eternal wisdom of God and the hidden truths revealed in Christ.|
|MAT 13:36|Then, leaving the crowds, He went into the house. His disciples approached Him, saying, "Please explain to us the parable of the tares."|In translating MAT 13:36, the goal is to keep a close alignment with the original Greek text while also making it clear and readable for modern audiences. To achieve this, I'll avoid overly complex terms and ensure the disciples' request sounds respectful. Additionally, I'll utilize a slightly formal tone without straying too far from contemporary English to appeal to both traditional and modern readers. I will also ensure the translation remains unique and does not infringe on existing versions by crafting a distinctive phrasing.  The phrase 'tares of the field' will be simplified to 'tares' to maintain clarity, and I'll make sure the tone of the disciples' request is preserved to reflect their respect for Jesus.|
|MAT 13:37|He answered and said to them, 'The one who sows the good seed is the Son of Man.'|In this verse, the term 'the sower' is identified as 'the Son of Man,' a title that emphasizes the dual nature of Jesus as both divine and human. The choice of the phrase 'the good seed' aligns with the theme of purity and divine origin of the message He imparts. The translation seeks to maintain fidelity to the original Greek while ensuring clarity for modern readers.|
|MAT 13:38|The field is the world; the good seed are the children of the kingdom, but the tares are the children of the wicked one.|This verse establishes the metaphorical significance of the world as a field, where good and evil are represented by the sons of the kingdom and the sons of the evil one respectively. The terms 'world', 'good seed', and 'sons' carry significant theological weight, highlighting the duality present in the created order.|
|MAT 13:39|The enemy who sowed them is the devil; the harvest is the end of the age, and the reapers are angels.|To ensure a literal and faithful translation of MAT 13:39, I will maintain the clarity regarding the roles of the devil, the harvest, and the angels. I will incorporate traditional Christian terminology where appropriate while also enhancing readability. This will involve slight adjustments in phrasing to improve flow without altering the original meaning. The goal is to respect the theological implications while making the text accessible and clear.|
|MAT 13:40|Just as the tares are gathered and burned with fire, so it will be at the conclusion of this age. 

*Footnote: 'Tares' refers to weeds or undesirable plants, often used metaphorically in Scripture to signify those who do not belong to the kingdom.|I will start by maintaining the term 'tares' to align with traditional theological terminology while providing a footnote for clarity. I will review the phrase 'the end of this age' and consider an alternative expression like 'the conclusion of this age' for clarity. Retaining the introductory phrase 'Just as' will help with the flow of the verse. I will ensure that the translation conveys the theological implications of the metaphor of 'tares' representing the children of the wicked one, and make minor stylistic adjustments to improve readability without sacrificing accuracy.|
|MAT 13:41|"The Son of Man will send His angels, and they will remove from His kingdom all offenses and those who commit lawlessness." 

*Footnote: 'Offenses' refers to actions or behaviors that lead others astray or create obstacles in faith, while 'those who commit lawlessness' indicates individuals who deliberately act against God's commandments, underscoring the call for moral integrity within the Kingdom.|In refining the translation of MAT 13:41, I will focus on enhancing the terminology for clarity and contemporary understanding, particularly substituting 'scandals' with 'offenses' while keeping 'those who practice lawlessness' for its theological precision. I will also ensure the urgency of judgment is conveyed by using 'remove from His kingdom' instead of 'gather out'. The sentence structure will be adjusted for improved readability, ensuring the flow remains natural while faithful to the original Greek. Additionally, I will incorporate a contextual footnote to explain the key terms in a way that resonates with conservative Christian values.|
|MAT 13:42|And they will throw them into the fiery furnace; there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.|This verse speaks of judgment and the consequences for those who are unrighteous, using vivid imagery of fire and anguish. The phrase 'weeping and gnashing of teeth' symbolizes deep sorrow and regret, often associated with divine judgment.|
|MAT 13:43|Then the righteous shall shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their Father. He who has ears, let him hear.

*Footnote: This verse emphasizes the glorious transformation and eternal reward awaiting the righteous in God's kingdom, illustrating the contrast between the righteous and the wicked.|In updating Matthew 13:43, I will ensure that the word 'righteous' is placed prominently before 'shine' to highlight its significance in the text. I'll adopt a formal tone to match the conservative Christian perspective, emphasizing the divine nature of the statement. A footnote will be added to explain the theological implications of the verse, particularly regarding the eternal reward of the righteous. Care will be taken to keep the translation clear and literal while avoiding paraphrasing, and ensuring that the divine aspect of the message is highlighted throughout the translation.|
|MAT 13:44|"Again, the Kingdom of Heaven is like a treasure concealed in a field, which a man, upon discovering it, hid again; and from his joy, he goes and sells all that he possesses to purchase that field." 

*Footnote: The hidden treasure symbolizes the invaluable worth of the Kingdom of Heaven, urging believers to recognize its significance and respond wholeheartedly.|The goal is to revise MAT 13:44 for clarity, emotional resonance, and consistent terminology, while ensuring it is a unique translation. I will enhance the readability by simplifying language, emphasize the man's joy, maintain consistent capitalization of 'Kingdom,' provide contextual insight about the hidden treasure, and avoid common phrasing to keep the translation original. This approach will ensure the verse aligns with conservative Christian principles and retains theological significance.|
|MAT 13:45|"Again, the Kingdom of Heaven is like a merchant in search of fine pearls." 

*Footnote: This verse underscores the earnest pursuit of the Kingdom of Heaven, likening it to a merchant who seeks valuable treasures. Just as the merchant diligently searches for fine pearls, believers are called to seek the Kingdom with passion and commitment, recognizing its surpassing worth. The pursuit of God's Kingdom requires sacrifice and prioritization, reminding us that true fulfillment and treasure are found in our relationship with God.|The current translation of Matthew 13:45 is already accurate, capturing the essence of the text. The goal is to enhance the footnote for greater theological insight, focusing on the personal implications of pursuing the Kingdom of Heaven. I'll maintain the clarity of the existing translation while adding contextual commentary that emphasizes the significance of the merchant's diligent search for fine pearls. This will enrich the understanding without altering the literal translation's structure.|
|MAT 13:46|Who, upon finding one priceless pearl, went away and sold all that he had to purchase it.|This translation seeks to convey the value and sacrifice represented in the parable of the pearl. The word 'merchant' suggests intentionality in seeking something of great worth, while 'pearl' symbolizes the Kingdom of Heaven's unparalleled value, warranting everything one possesses to obtain it.|
|MAT 13:47|"Again, the Kingdom of Heaven is like a net that was cast into the sea and gathered fish of every kind." 

*Contextual Note: This metaphor illustrates the gathering of people into the Kingdom, emphasizing inclusivity alongside the significant theme of impending judgment that will separate the righteous from the wicked.|In revising MAT 13:47, the goal is to enhance clarity while remaining faithful to the original Greek. I will rephrase 'gathered every kind of fish' to 'gathered fish of every kind' to improve readability. Additionally, I will ensure that the contextual note emphasizes the judgment aspect without straying from the verse's meaning. I aim for natural phrasing that maintains the theological implications of judgment as significant in this passage. The final translation should reflect both clarity and theological accuracy.|
|MAT 13:48|"When it was filled, they pulled the net onto the shore; and sitting down, they gathered the good fish into vessels, but threw the worthless fish away." 

*Explanatory Note: This imagery illustrates the eventual separation that will occur at the end of the age, where the righteous will be distinguished from the wicked, emphasizing the theme of divine judgment and accountability.|To enhance clarity and consistency in the translation of MAT 13:48, I will replace 'bad fish' with 'worthless fish' for better understanding and theological context. I will maintain a clear reference to 'the net' to ensure that the imagery aligns with previous verses. The adjustments will also focus on readability without sacrificing the literal translation. Additionally, I will incorporate a brief note on the metaphorical implications of the separation of fish, reflecting the themes of judgment present in this passage.|
|MAT 13:49|So it will be at the end of the age: the angels will come forth and separate the wicked from among the righteous.|The phrase 'at the end of the age' is a significant eschatological term, referring to the final judgment. The term 'angels' here indicates divine beings tasked with separating the wicked from the righteous, highlighting the concept of judgment and accountability in biblical theology.|
|MAT 13:50|And they will throw them into the fiery furnace; there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.|In this verse, the imagery of being cast into the fiery furnace emphasizes the finality of judgment and the intense suffering of separation from God. The 'weeping' and 'gnashing of teeth' depict the profound regret and pain of those judged. This fresh translation seeks to reflect the gravity of this fate while staying true to the original text's intention.|
|MAT 13:51|Jesus said to them, "Have you understood all these things?" They answered Him, "Yes, Lord."|In this verse, Jesus is asking His disciples if they have understood the teachings He has just shared, emphasizing the importance of comprehension in spiritual matters. The response 'Yes, Lord' indicates their affirmation of understanding.|
|MAT 13:52|And He said to them, "Therefore, every scribe trained for the kingdom of heaven is like a master of the house who brings forth from his treasure things both new and old."|In revising the translation for Matthew 13:52, I will incorporate the suggested changes while ensuring that the meaning remains faithful to the original Greek text. First, I will consider the term 'οἰκοδεσπότῃ' (householder) and explore alternatives like 'master of the house' or simply retaining 'householder' if it better resonates with the audience. I will replace 'brings out' with 'brings forth' to enhance clarity and modernize the phrasing. I will also pay attention to maintaining theological implications consistent with conservative Christian values and aim for a translation that reflects the depth of Jesus' teachings in the context of the Kingdom of Heaven. Additionally, I will ensure that the final wording is original enough to avoid any potential plagiarism issues, while still accurately conveying the original message.|
|MAT 13:53|And it came to pass, when Jesus had finished these parables, He departed from there.

*Footnote: This moment signifies an important transition in Jesus' ministry, marking the conclusion of His teaching through parables that reveal essential truths about the Kingdom of Heaven.|To update MAT 13:53, I will adhere closely to the guidelines provided. I will keep the phrase 'And it came to pass' to maintain the traditional style valued by conservative audiences. The phrase 'He departed from there' will be retained for clarity and readability while ensuring it maintains a traditional tone. The footnote will be refined to provide context without delving into interpretative nuances, remaining informative yet straightforward. Minor adjustments will be made for fluidity, but these will be subtle to ensure that the literal meaning is preserved.|
|MAT 13:54|And when He came to His own country, He taught them in their synagogue, so that they were astonished and said, "From where did this man get this wisdom and these miracles?"|In addressing the correction for MAT 13:54, I will ensure clarity and fluency in the translation while maintaining literal fidelity to the Greek text. I'll simplify the phrasing, particularly regarding the wisdom and powers attributed to Jesus, and remove redundancy. By using 'his own country' instead of 'hometown', the translation will adhere to the suggested adjustments regarding geographical references. Additionally, I will replace 'miraculous powers' with 'miracles' to better align with conservative theological terminology. I will also make sure to include quotation marks for direct speech and ensure that the flow of the sentence remains smooth. The surrounding context will be succinctly summarized to aid comprehension, emphasizing the build-up of Jesus' reputation leading to this moment.|
|MAT 13:55|Is not this the son of the carpenter? Is not His mother called Mary, and are not His brothers James, Joseph, Simon, and Judas?|To revise MAT 13:55 effectively, I will focus on enhancing the fluidity of the phrase by restructuring it for better readability. I will also avoid contractions to align with a more formal biblical style, changing 'Isn't' to 'Is not'. Moreover, I will ensure the original meaning is preserved while maintaining clarity. This approach will help in producing an original translation that stands apart from existing versions while remaining faithful to the Greek text.|
|MAT 13:56|"Are not all His sisters here with us? Where then did this man gain all these things?" 

*Contextual Note: This verse reflects the local familiarity with Jesus, highlighting the crowd's astonishment at His wisdom and miraculous powers despite their knowledge of His family background. The mention of 'sisters' indicates the close-knit nature of Jesus' family, further emphasizing the crowd's incredulity regarding the source of His authority.|To address the instructions effectively, I will enhance the clarity and flow by rephrasing to use simpler and more direct words, ensuring it remains true to the literal Greek translation. I will also strive to capture the astonishment expressed by the crowd in their questioning, making sure to use a formal tone that resonates with the authority of scripture. Furthermore, I'll include a brief note explaining the cultural context of Jesus' family background, particularly regarding the term 'sisters,' while maintaining a conservative perspective.|
|MAT 13:57|And they took offense at Him. But Jesus said to them, 'A prophet is not without honor except in his own country and in his own house.'|In this translation, the emphasis is placed on the notion of offense taken at Jesus by those familiar with Him. The term 'offended' captures the essence of the original Greek 'ἐσκανδαλίζοντο', which denotes being scandalized or stumbling over Him due to preconceived notions. Additionally, the phrase 'a prophet without honor' is a direct translation that underscores the theme of rejection experienced by prophets in their own communities.|
|MAT 13:58|"And He did not do many mighty works there because of their unbelief."\n\n*Footnote: This verse emphasizes the significant impact of unbelief on the works of Jesus, illustrating how doubt can hinder divine action.|To revise MAT 13:58, I will incorporate the suggested changes from my teachers while remaining true to the original Greek text. The changes will include terminology adjustments to clarify meaning, improving phrasing for straightforwardness, and enhancing readability without losing the literal essence. The footnote will be retained, ensuring it adds value to the reader's understanding of how unbelief affects the works of Jesus. In this process, I will prioritize the accurate representation of 'mighty works' over 'miracles' to reflect the Greek term more faithfully. Overall, these adjustments aim to create a clearer and more effective translation for the audience.|
