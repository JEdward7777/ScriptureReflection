|:---------:|-------|-------------------|
|MAT 18:1|At that time, the disciples approached Jesus, asking, 'Who is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven?'|In updating MAT 18:1, I will focus on correcting the punctuation to reflect that it is a question, improving the natural flow of the English phrasing while keeping the essence of the original Greek text. I will also ensure that my translation is literal and consistent without adding extra interpretive commentary, adhering strictly to the textual context provided. The updated translation will maintain clarity and simplicity, as requested.|
|MAT 18:2|And Jesus summoned a little child and placed him in their midst.|The goal is to enhance the translation of MAT 18:2 by ensuring it remains faithful to the original Greek text while also improving clarity and engagement. Following the peer review suggestions, I will focus on using more precise terms and maintaining a structure that closely reflects the Greek. Specifically, I'll replace 'among them' with 'in their midst' and refer to 'the little child' for specificity. I'll use 'summoned' to convey authority and maintain a formal tone. Additionally, I'll prepare a brief footnote to explain the significance of Jesus placing the child in their midst, which will provide context without altering the literal translation itself.|
|MAT 18:3|Truly, I say to you, unless you turn and become as little children, you will not enter the kingdom of heaven. [Footnote: Emphasizes the necessity of repentance and childlike faith for entering the kingdom of God.]|In revising MAT 18:3, I will focus on enhancing the word choice for clarity and directness, particularly in phrases regarding entering the kingdom of heaven. I will simplify language while retaining theological depth. The phrase 'turn away' will be kept as 'turn' to more directly indicate the need for repentance. I will also adjust the structure for better readability, particularly in the phrase 'become as little children.' The footnote will be made more concise while still providing context for the need for childlike faith.|
|MAT 18:4|Therefore, whoever humbles himself like this child is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven.|In this translation, the essence of humility as related to childlike faith is emphasized. The word 'humble' is used consistently to convey the importance of lowering oneself, as modeled by children. The phrase 'in the kingdom of heaven' signifies a spiritual elevation linked to this humility.|
|MAT 18:5|And whoever welcomes one such child in my name welcomes me.|I will ensure that the translation of MAT 18:5 adheres closely to the original Greek text while also ensuring that it avoids unnecessary interpretive additions. The word 'welcomes' will be retained to maintain a sense of hospitality. I will clarify the reference to 'this child' in a way that highlights its significance in the context of discipleship without straying into commentary. Furthermore, I will use language that is contemporary yet respectful of the traditional biblical tone.|
|MAT 18:6|But whoever causes one of these little ones who believe in me to stumble, it would be better for him to have a heavy millstone hung around his neck and to be drowned in the depths of the sea.|In this verse, the term 'little ones' refers to those who believe in Jesus, emphasizing their vulnerability and the severe consequences for leading them astray. The imagery of a millstone reflects the weighty punishment for such actions, underscoring the seriousness with which Jesus views the responsibility of believers toward one another, especially toward the innocent or young in faith.|
|MAT 18:7|"Woe to the world because of scandals! For it is necessary that temptations come; but woe to that man through whom the scandal comes!"|In revising MAT 18:7, I will focus on the suggested corrections: maintaining consistency in terminology with 'scandals' and 'temptations', adjusting the phrasing for better fluidity while keeping the literal meaning, using a formal tone in line with traditional biblical language, emphasizing the moral responsibility of individuals in causing others to sin, and refining punctuation for clarity. The aim is to present a translation that resonates with conservative Christian values and biblical accuracy while remaining readable and impactful.|
|MAT 18:8|"And if your hand or your foot causes you to stumble, cut it off and throw it away. It is better for you to enter into eternal life maimed or lame than to have two hands or two feet and be cast into the eternal fire."|In addressing the correction for MAT 18:8, I will implement the suggested word choice adjustments to enhance alignment with traditional translations and the original Greek text. I will clarify the phrasing regarding eternal life and ensure that the theological significance of 'eternal fire' remains prominent.

Overall, my focus is on clarity and faithfulness to the source text.|
|MAT 18:9|And if your eye causes you to stumble, pluck it out and cast it away from you; for it is better for you to enter into life having one eye than to have two eyes and be cast into the fiery Gehenna.|In this translation of MAT 18:9, I will maintain the literal fidelity to the original Greek text while enhancing clarity and readability. I will prioritize conveying the urgency of Jesus' warning by keeping strong verbs like 'tear out' and using formal structures. The tone will be authoritative, aiming to resonate with modern audiences while reflecting conservative Christian theological perspectives. I will ensure the translation remains unique to avoid plagiarism, crafting it with a balance between literal translation and contemporary language usage.|
|MAT 18:10|"Take care not to despise one of these young ones; for I tell you that their angels in heaven always behold the face of my Father who is in heaven."|To enhance the translation of MAT 18:10, I will retain the essential elements and authority of the original Greek text while aiming for improved clarity and modern readability. I will consider substituting 'little ones' with 'these young ones' to connect better with contemporary audiences while preserving the original intent. The phrase 'Take heed' will be kept for its authoritative tone, but I will ensure the rest of the sentence flows more naturally in English. The overall goal is to balance literal translation with modern understanding and ensure faithfulness to the source text.|
|MAT 18:11|For the Son of Man has come to seek and save that which was lost.|This verse emphasizes the mission of Jesus, the Son of Man, to rescue those who have gone astray. The term 'lost' is used consistently throughout the New Testament to signify those who are in spiritual danger or separation from God, echoing the heart of Christ's redemptive purpose.|

If a man has a hundred sheep and one of them goes astray, does he not leave the ninety-nine on the mountains and go in search of the one that has gone astray?"|In translating Matthew 18:12, I need to ensure that I clarify the phrasing by replacing 'What do you think?' with 'What is your opinion?' to make it clearer for readers. Additionally, I must keep the literal nature of the text while ensuring it flows naturally in English. Phrases like 'astray' and 'search' are effective but can be slightly rephrased to enhance readability. Moreover, I should emphasize the loving pursuit of God, consistent with conservative Christian beliefs. Finally, I will avoid closely mirroring existing translations to maintain originality and avoid plagiarism.|
|MAT 18:13|And if he finds it, Amen, I say to you, he rejoices with greater joy over it than over the ninety-nine who have not gone astray. [Footnote: This parable illustrates God's immense love for each individual, emphasizing the joy in salvation and restoration of the lost.]|The goal is to create a literal translation of MAT 18:13 that is faithful to the original Greek while incorporating the corrections provided. Starting with 'Amen, I say to you' gives the verse an authoritative tone. Replacing 'he rejoices more than over' with 'he rejoices with greater joy over' enhances clarity and maintains the emphasis on the joy experienced by the shepherd. The phrase 'the ninety-nine that were not lost' aligns with traditional translations and provides consistency. The inclusion of a footnote will help explain the broader significance of the lost sheep, reflecting God's love and care for sinners.

|MAT 18:14|Thus, it is not the will of the heavenly Father that one of these little ones should be lost.|In reworking Matthew 18:14, I will incorporate the suggested phrasing adjustments to improve flow and theological nuance. I will change 'perish' to 'be lost' to emphasize the idea of salvation and loss in a way that resonates with modern readers. Additionally, I will switch 'Your' to 'the' to enhance reverence in the translation. This will maintain a balance between a literal approach and accessibility, reflecting God's care for the vulnerable while avoiding any issues of plagiarism by ensuring originality in the wording.|

It suggests a step-by-step approach to resolving conflict, with the goal of restoration and the maintenance of community integrity. The phrase 'if your brother sins against you' indicates a personal grievance that requires attention. 'You have gained your brother' reflects the ultimate aim of bringing someone back into the fold, highlighting the communal aspect of Christian fellowship.|
|MAT 18:16|But if he does not listen, take one or two others along with you, that every word may be confirmed by the testimony of two or three witnesses.|This verse emphasizes the importance of establishing truth through the testimony of multiple witnesses, aligning with biblical principles of justice and accountability.|
|MAT 18:17|If he refuses to hear them, tell it to the church; and if he disregards the church, let him be to you like an unbeliever and a tax collector.|In revising MAT 18:17, I will maintain a formal tone and aim for clarity by replacing the terms 'Gentile' and 'tax collector' with more accessible phrasing, such as 'unbeliever' and 'tax collector', to emphasize their social standing. The footnote will be integrated into the translation for better flow without sacrificing context. I will ensure consistent use of phrases like 'refuses to hear' to align closely with the original Greek while keeping the overall tone polished and formal, minimizing interpretative commentary.|
|MAT 18:18|"Truly, I say to you, whatever you bind on earth shall be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven." [Footnote: The terms 'bind' and 'loose' refer to the authority given to the church to make decisions regarding doctrinal and disciplinary matters, reflecting their significance in aligning actions with God's will.]|To create a translation for Matthew 18:18 that maintains fidelity to the original Greek while ensuring clarity for modern readers, I will focus on a few key aspects. First, I will keep the literal structure of the sentence to stay true to the source text. Then, I will rephrase certain terms to enhance understanding without sacrificing the formal tone. Next, I will include a footnote to clarify the theological significance of the terms 'bind' and 'loose,' as these are vital for understanding the authority of the church.

First, I'll adjust the terminology for consistency with the original source, specifically replacing 'my Heavenly Father' with 'my Father in heaven'. Next, I will rephrase the request language to maintain clarity and directness, ensuring that 'for which they request' becomes 'anything they ask'. I will also rephrase 'it shall be done for them' to 'it will come to pass for them' to reflect God's promise more authoritatively. Furthermore, I will emphasize the communal aspect of 'you' to reflect the collective nature of prayer, reinforcing the idea that this instruction pertains to the group as a whole.

Additionally, I will emphasize the theological significance of Jesus' presence among believers, especially in the context of communal gathering, which ties back to the surrounding verses discussing church discipline and prayer. The final phrasing will be unique to avoid plagiarism, yet retain the essence of the verse.|
|MAT 18:21|Then Peter came up to Him and said, 'Lord, how often shall my brother sin against me, and I forgive him? Up to seven times?'|In this verse, Peter approaches Jesus with a question about forgiveness. The term 'forgive' used here has the same connotation of mercy and grace found in other parts of scripture. The number 'seven' suggests completeness, and Peter's inquiry reflects a desire to understand the limits of forgiveness, indicating an expectation of boundaries.|
|MAT 18:22|Jesus said to him, "I do not say to you up to seven times, but up to seventy times seven."|In this verse, Jesus is emphasizing the boundless nature of forgiveness.

|MAT 18:23|Therefore, the kingdom of heaven is like a king who desired to settle accounts with his servants.|In addressing the translation of MAT 18:23, the goal is to enhance clarity and fluency while ensuring the formal tone is appropriate for biblical text. I'll simplify phrases, such as replacing 'wished to settle accounts' with 'desired to settle accounts,' as it reflects a more formal tone. I'll maintain consistency in terminology by using 'king' rather than a general term. Restructuring the sentence slightly will also contribute to a smoother reading experience. Additionally, I'll ensure that the theological implications of 'the kingdom of heaven' are preserved in the updated translation, reflecting God's sovereignty accurately.|

I will rephrase 'please be patient with me' to 'be patient with me' for a more direct expression. I will use 'begged' instead of 'implored' to convey a stronger sense of desperation.
