| Reference | Verse | Translation Notes |
|:---------:|-------|-------------------|
|MAT 10:1|And having called His twelve disciples to Him, He gave them authority over unclean spirits, to cast them out, and to heal every disease and every affliction.|In this verse, Jesus is calling His twelve disciples and bestowing upon them the authority to cast out unclean spirits and to heal all diseases and afflictions. The focus is on the empowerment of the disciples for the ministry ahead of them. 'Authority' is rendered to reflect the divine empowerment given to them by Jesus. The term for 'unclean spirits' indicates spiritual oppression, while 'disease' and 'affliction' encompass physical ailments.|
|MAT 10:2|The names of the twelve apostles are these: First, Simon, who is called Peter, and his brother Andrew; James, the son of Zebedee, and his brother John.|To refine MAT 10:2 according to the provided corrections, I'll focus on restructuring the phrase for clarity and fidelity to the original Greek. The changes will include introducing the list of apostles in a way that adheres to the nuances of the Greek text while enhancing readability. I'll maintain consistency in terminology, ensuring the term 'apostles' is used consistently and appropriately. The sentence structure will be formalized to make the introduction of the apostles clearer.|
|MAT 10:3|Philip and Bartholomew, Thomas and Matthew the tax collector, James the son of Alphaeus, and Thaddeus.|To refine the translation of MAT 10:3, I will remove redundancies, particularly the phrase 'also known as Lebbaeus,' since it can clutter the reading. I'll opt for 'tax collector' to ensure clarity for modern audiences while considering that it may sound slightly formal, but it's commonly understood. The addition of 'and' before the last name will help the flow of the list. Maintaining consistency with the previous translations in MAT 10 will further ensure clarity and style alignment. Additionally, I’ll include contextual commentary to enhance understanding without altering the integrity of the translation.|
|MAT 10:4|Simon the Zealot, and Judas Iscariot, who also betrayed Him.|In this verse, Simon is identified with the title 'the Zealot' in some traditions, while in this case, the term 'Canaanite' refers to his origin, indicating he belonged to a region associated with zeal or passionate fervor for Jewish nationalism. Judas Iscariot's identity as 'the one who betrayed him' is significant for understanding the narrative context and the gravity of his actions.|
|MAT 10:5|These twelve Jesus sent out, having commanded them, 'Do not go among the Gentiles, and do not enter a city of the Samaritans;'|To create an updated translation of MAT 10:5, I will incorporate the corrections provided to enhance authority, clarity, and literal fidelity while simplifying the structure for improved readability. I will replace 'with this command' with 'having commanded them' to convey the authoritative nature of Jesus' instructions, and I'll change 'Do not take the path of the Gentiles' to 'Do not go among the Gentiles' for better understanding. I'll ensure that the phrasing reflects a direct rendering from the Greek, aligning with the translation objective.|
|MAT 10:6|But rather go to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.|This verse emphasizes the mission of Jesus and His disciples focusing on the Jewish people, especially those who are spiritually lost, as symbolized by 'the lost sheep.' It indicates a prioritization of outreach to those in Israel who need guidance and salvation, aligning with the overarching narrative of Jesus's ministry.|
|MAT 10:7|As you go, preach, saying, 'The kingdom of heaven has drawn near.'|In updating MAT 10:7, I will ensure to maintain the imperative nature of 'preach' to convey the urgency of the directive. Additionally, I will choose 'has drawn near' instead of 'is at hand' for a more literal interpretation of the text, emphasizing the immediacy of the proclamation. To enhance the flow and maintain clarity, I will avoid adding 'and' before 'preach,' keeping the phrase concise. The goal is to produce a unique translation that remains faithful to the original text while ensuring it is clear and accessible for contemporary readers.|
|MAT 10:8|Heal the sick, cleanse the lepers, raise the dead, cast out demons; freely you have received; freely give.|The goal is to revise MAT 10:8 by implementing the suggested corrections while ensuring clarity, consistency, and adherence to a literal translation approach. I will remove the brackets around 'raise the dead' to present it definitively in the text. I will also adjust the wording 'you received freely; give freely' to 'freely you have received; freely give' to enhance readability while retaining the imperative nature of the command. I will also note the textual variant regarding 'raise the dead' in my explanations to provide context. Lastly, I'll maintain the use of 'lepers' instead of more contemporary phrases, to stay true to the original text and its implications.|
|MAT 10:9|Do not acquire gold or silver or bronze for yourselves to carry in your belts.|To enhance the translation of MAT 10:9, I will restructure the phrase to incorporate 'for yourselves' to emphasize personal ownership. I will clarify that 'belts' refers to the carrying of money, ensuring that the cultural context is understood. Additionally, I will make slight adjustments in phrasing to maintain fidelity to the original Greek while avoiding plagiarism from other translations. This approach will uphold the translation's clarity and effectiveness, making it accessible to readers.|
|MAT 10:10|Do not take a bag for the journey, nor two tunics, nor sandals, nor staff; for a worker deserves sustenance.|In revising MAT 10:10, I will implement the suggested changes for improved clarity and readability. The phrase 'extra travel bag' will be modified to 'a bag for the journey' to align better with cultural understanding. I will also adjust 'the worker' to 'a worker' to enhance generality and clarity in the phrase about sustenance. I will maintain the list format for items to ensure rhythmic consistency and ensure that the overall sentence structure flows naturally in English while preserving the original meaning.|
|MAT 10:11|And into whichever city or village you enter, search for who is worthy in it, and there stay until you depart.|The goal is to simplify and clarify the translation of MAT 10:11 while remaining faithful to the original Greek text. I will replace 'actively seek out who is worthy' with 'inquire who is worthy' to stay true to 'ἐξετάσατε' while also enhancing clarity by using 'search for' instead. The phrase 'there stay until you leave' will be maintained, but I will also ensure that it flows smoothly and is easily understandable. Overall, I will focus on directness and readability while adhering to a literal translation approach without infringing on existing translations.|
|MAT 10:12|As you enter the house, greet it, saying, 'Peace to this house.'|To enhance the clarity and modern accessibility of the translation, I will replace 'bestow a greeting upon it' with 'greet the house'. This simplification maintains the formal tone required for biblical text while ensuring the message is easily understood by contemporary readers. I will also expand the contextual note to further elaborate on the theological significance of 'peace' and its relation to the concept of 'shalom', focusing on how this greeting embodies God's blessings. Overall, I aim to refine the verse while retaining its core meaning and theological implications, steering clear of any previous wording that may have been less effective or clear.|
|MAT 10:13|And if the house is deserving, let your peace rest upon it; but if it is not deserving, let your peace return to you.|This verse emphasizes the significance of peace in the context of hospitality and community. The concept of worthiness in the house reflects a broader biblical theme regarding the reception of God's peace based on the faith and conduct of those within.|
|MAT 10:14|And whoever does not receive you or listen to your words, as you leave that house or city, shake the dust off your feet.|This verse highlights the importance of acceptance of the message being preached. The act of shaking off the dust signifies a strong response to rejection and serves as a testament against those who do not accept the message.|
|MAT 10:15|Verily, I say to you, it will be more bearable for the city of Sodom and Gomorrah on the day of judgment than for that city.|In translating MAT 10:15, I will ensure that the literal rendering aligns closely with the Greek text while maintaining clarity and fluidity for modern readers. I will use the term 'city' as specified in the Greek text to avoid confusion with 'land.' The phrase 'Truly, I say to you' will be translated to keep its solemnity while enhancing readability, potentially using 'Verily, I say to you' to strike a balance. I will also ensure that my translation does not closely mimic any existing translations to maintain originality and prevent plagiarism.|
|MAT 10:16|Behold, I am sending you out as sheep in the midst of wolves; therefore be as wise as serpents and innocent as doves.|In this verse, Jesus uses the metaphor of sending His disciples as sheep among wolves to illustrate the vulnerability and danger they will face in their mission. The imagery of being 'wise as serpents' and 'innocent as doves' underscores the need for shrewdness in dealing with challenges while maintaining purity in character. The words 'sheep,' 'wolves,' 'wise,' and 'innocent' have been carefully translated to convey the original intent without losing the imagery.|
|MAT 10:17|"Beware of men, for they will hand you over to the Sanhedrin and scourge you in their synagogues."|In revising Matthew 10:17, I will focus on maintaining the accuracy of the translation while enhancing clarity and readability. To address the feedback, I will consider the term 'deliver' and explore alternatives such as 'hand over' or 'betray' that convey the legal implications more effectively. Additionally, I will choose to keep 'scourge' as it holds historical significance, while ensuring the sentence flows smoothly. To add depth, I'll also provide a contextual note regarding the 'Sanhedrin' and the implications of being flogged, thus improving comprehension without compromising the literal aspect of the translation. Ultimately, the aim is to capture the urgency of Jesus' warning while being faithful to the source text.|
|MAT 10:18|"And you will be delivered up before governors and kings for my sake, to bear witness to them and to the Gentiles."|In updating Matthew 10:18, I will focus on enhancing clarity and consistency in terminology while maintaining a literal translation approach. I will replace 'to testify' with 'to bear witness' to ensure comprehension aligns with common usage in the context of Scripture. Additionally, I will keep the phrase 'for my sake' to emphasize the personal connection with Christ. To maintain uniformity, I will ensure that the phrasing aligns with other verses where similar contexts arise. The aim is to balance faithfulness to the original text with a readability that respects the nuances of the English language.|
|MAT 10:19|But when they hand you over, do not worry about how to speak or what to say; for it will be given to you at that time what you should say.|The objective is to revise the translation of MAT 10:19 while simplifying phrasing for clarity, enhancing fluidity, and maintaining faithfulness to the original text. The suggestions indicate a need for clearer expressions and smoother transitions without deviating from the meaning. Therefore, I will change 'how or what to say' to 'how to speak or what to say', and adjust 'do not worry' for consistency and resonance with a conservative audience. The phrasing will also be refined for better fluidity. Finally, I'll ensure that the updated translation does not resemble existing translations to avoid copyright issues.|
|MAT 10:20|For it is not you who will be speaking, but the Spirit of your Father speaking through you.|This verse emphasizes that it is not the individual speaking, but rather the Holy Spirit of the Father who speaks through them, highlighting the divine assistance given in times of need. The original Greek reflects this distinction between the speaker and the divine voice within.|
|MAT 10:21|"A brother will deliver a brother to death, and a father his child; and children will rise up against their parents and cause them to be killed."|To effectively address the instructions for refining the translation of MAT 10:21, I will maintain a balance between literal accuracy and readability. The term 'betray' will be replaced with 'deliver' in both instances to provide clarity. The phrase 'put them to death' will be revised to 'cause them to be killed' to highlight the serious conflict without graphic implications. Additionally, traditional language will be employed where it enhances the gravity of the verse while ensuring that the meaning remains intact. This approach aims to reflect the emotional weight of familial betrayal while enhancing the flow and clarity of the translation.|
|MAT 10:22|And you will be hated by all for my name’s sake; but the one who endures to the end will be saved.|This translation maintains the essence of the original Greek text while using contemporary English phrasing. The term 'hated' conveys the sense of animosity and hostility, while 'endures' captures the notion of perseverance. 'Will be saved' directly refers to spiritual salvation as promised by Jesus.|
|MAT 10:23|When they persecute you in this city, flee to another; for indeed, I say to you, you will not finish going through cities of Israel before the Son of Man comes.|To revise Matthew 10:23, I will make the suggested changes for clarity and modern readability while preserving the original intent. This includes simplifying the phrase 'the cities of Israel' to 'cities of Israel' and replacing 'truly' with 'indeed' to enhance the flow. I'll also ensure that the authoritative tone of Jesus' words is maintained and avoid any archaic terms, making it more accessible to contemporary readers. After careful consideration of the context and feedback, I will present the updated translation accordingly.|
|MAT 10:24|A disciple is not above his teacher, nor is a servant above his master.|This verse emphasizes the relationship between a disciple and their teacher, highlighting that a student does not exceed their mentor's authority or position. It sets the context for the struggles that disciples of Jesus may face in light of His teachings and their commitment to follow Him.|
|MAT 10:25|It is enough for the disciple to become like his teacher, and the servant like his master. If they have called the master of the house Beelzebul, how much more will they malign those of his household?|In this verse, the structure highlights the relationship between a disciple and his teacher, and a servant and his master. It emphasizes that the student is to aspire to be like the teacher, which suggests a call to emulate the character and teachings of Christ. The reference to Beelzebul serves as a contrast, showing the severe judgment against those who oppose God, underscoring the serious nature of the disciples’ calling.|
|MAT 10:26|Therefore, do not fear them; for nothing is concealed that will not be revealed, nor hidden that will not be disclosed.|In light of the provided corrections, the key focus for MAT 10:26 is to maintain a literal fidelity to the Greek text while enhancing clarity and resonance with a conservative Christian audience. The original phrase structure will be preserved as much as possible, but redundant language will be streamlined for better comprehension. Traditional language that emphasizes the contrast between fear of men and the fear of God will also be incorporated to reinforce theological implications. By applying these adjustments, the translation will not only be faithful to the original but also impactful for its intended audience.|
|MAT 10:27|What I instruct you in the darkness, proclaim in the light; and what you hear whispered, declare from the rooftops.|To enhance the clarity and urgency of MAT 10:27, I will rephrase 'speak in the light' to create a more vivid and commanding tone, using a stronger verb than 'speak.' I will also ensure the overall tone remains formal to reflect the seriousness of the instruction. For the word 'announce,' I will select a term that resonates more with the sense of urgency in the original Greek. The phrase 'what you hear whispered' will remain largely unchanged, but I will ensure it conveys an immediacy to the call to action. I will also consider how to emphasize the urgency and importance of sharing this message in a manner consistent with Jesus' teachings.|
|MAT 10:28|"And do not fear those who kill the body but are not able to kill the soul; rather, fear Him who is able to destroy both soul and body in hell."|To ensure the updated translation of MAT 10:28 reflects a literal and faithful rendering of the original Greek while enhancing clarity, I will maintain the original meaning without introducing interpretive additions. The phrase 'in hell' will be retained to align with traditional theological interpretations and underscore the seriousness of divine judgment versus human fear. Additionally, I'll prepare an explanatory note to further elucidate the implications of 'fear' as it pertains to a conservative Christian understanding of God's sovereignty.|
|MAT 10:29|"Are not two sparrows sold for a penny? And not one of them falls to the ground apart from your Father." (See footnote for cultural significance regarding the value of sparrows in the marketplace and God's care for creation.)|I will ensure that the translation of MAT 10:29 is literal while also enhancing clarity for modern readers. I'll incorporate the suggested wording changes to better reflect the original text, emphasizing God's providence. I will also include a note regarding the cultural significance of sparrows, which helps underline their value in the eyes of God. Lastly, I'll ensure that the formatting is consistent with the other translations in the passage.|
|MAT 10:30|But even the very hairs on your heads have all been counted.|In reviewing the current translation of MAT 10:30, the objective is to refine the text for literal fidelity while enhancing clarity for modern readers. The phrase 'are all counted' can be maintained for its literal sense, yet rephrasing it slightly to 'have all been counted' could improve readability. Furthermore, reinforcing the relationship to the audience by using 'your heads' will personalize the statement and connect better with the readers. The context of God's detailed care for His creation is significant here and should be acknowledged, though without veering into interpretative commentary. Final review will ensure that the translation remains distinct and true to the original meaning without infringing on existing translations.|
|MAT 10:31|"Therefore, do not be afraid; you are of greater worth than many sparrows." (See footnote regarding God's intimate care for all His creation, particularly highlighting that sparrows, often seen as insignificant, are known and valued by God, thereby illustrating human dignity and value in His eyes.)|To enhance MAT 10:31 based on the provided corrections, I will first rephrase the verse to highlight the individual's worth more clearly. By rearranging the structure to emphasize 'you' before 'are worth', I can strengthen the message. Additionally, I will use vocabulary that reinforces the common nature of sparrows, suggesting how much more valuable humans are in God's sight. I'll incorporate contextual notes that explain the significance of sparrows, ensuring they are concise and enhance understanding without overcrowding the translation. Regarding punctuation, I will choose a semicolon to maintain a formal tone while still conveying a strong message of comfort and value. Finally, I will ensure the translation remains original and does not directly copy other translations.|
|MAT 10:32|Therefore, whoever confesses me before men, I will also confess him before my Father who is in heaven.|To enhance the emotional resonance and urgency of the verse, I will replace 'everyone' with 'whoever' to give a sense of exclusivity to the action of confessing Christ. This aligns with the feedback from the peer review while maintaining the integrity of the original text. The aim is to ensure that the updated translation remains faithful to the Greek source, accurately reflects conservative Christian beliefs, and upholds copyright guidelines by ensuring originality.|
|MAT 10:33|But whoever denies me before men, I will also deny him before my Father who is in heaven.|In revising MAT 10:33, I will ensure to keep the phrase 'deny me' to stay true to the original Greek text. I'll make slight adjustments to enhance readability and clarity while maintaining the formal language appropriate for a biblical context. I will also emphasize the gravity of denying Christ in relation to one's faith, aligning with conservative Christian teachings. The structure will remain simple and direct to convey the seriousness of the message effectively without complicating the language unnecessarily.|
|MAT 10:34|"Do not suppose that I have come to cast peace upon the earth; I did not come to cast peace, but a sword." <br><br>*Footnote: This declaration underscores the reality that discipleship may incite conflict, especially within family units, as individuals choose their allegiance to Jesus over traditional family ties. This challenges the common perception of the Messiah solely as a peace-bringer, illustrating instead that His mission often disrupts societal norms and familial bonds in the pursuit of truth and faithfulness to Him. Moreover, the mention of 'sword' implies division and struggle that may arise as a result of one’s commitment to the Gospel, signaling a clear departure from the expectations of societal peace.*|To enhance readability while maintaining a literal translation, I will keep the phrase 'Do not suppose' as it captures the intent of the original text effectively. I will also consider alternatives that may directly reflect the original Greek while preserving clarity. The cultural context will be expanded in the footnotes, particularly regarding the social implications of Jesus' statements, highlighting the potential for conflict within familial relationships when following Him. I will ensure a formal tone in the translation to reinforce its seriousness and impact, refining the sentence structure for a better flow while remaining faithful to the Greek text. Additional footnotes will explore the broader implications of Jesus' mission concerning peace and conflict, thus providing deeper insights into the societal challenges His followers might encounter. Lastly, I will emphasize the contrasts present in the original Greek to maintain structural fidelity throughout the passage.|
|MAT 10:35|For I have come to bring division among a man and his father, a daughter and her mother, and a daughter-in-law and her mother-in-law.|To address the peer review comments, I will restructure the translation to enhance clarity and flow. I will rephrase 'and a daughter against her mother' to make it more fluid. Additionally, I will consider adding a footnote or contextual note that explains the cultural implications of familial divisions in the context of faith. The phrase 'set against' will be examined to reflect its significance in the broader teachings of Jesus, especially in light of loyalty and the challenges faced by believers. I will also ensure that this verse connects well with the surrounding context, particularly how it aligns with Jesus' mission and the message of faith amidst familial challenges. Overall, I aim to maintain a literal translation that is faithful to the Greek text while ensuring clarity and conveying the original message effectively.|
|MAT 10:36|And a man's foes will be those of his own household.|The phrase 'ἐχθροὶ τοῦ ἀνθρώπου' translates to 'enemies of the man' indicating a hostile relationship within the familial context. The use of 'οἱ οἰκιακοὶ αὐτοῦ' refers specifically to his own household or family members, emphasizing the intensity of division Jesus speaks about.|
|MAT 10:37|Whoever loves father or mother more than me is not worthy of me, and whoever loves son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me.|In this verse, the term 'loves' indicates a deep attachment, suggesting that those who place familial relationships above their commitment to Christ cannot fully embrace the demands of discipleship. The word 'worthy' conveys the idea of being deserving or having value in the context of following Jesus. This fresh translation maintains the emphatic nature of Christ's teaching on prioritizing allegiance to Him over earthly ties.|
|MAT 10:38|And whoever does not bear his cross and follow me is unworthy of me.|To improve the translation of MAT 10:38, I will incorporate the suggested corrections focusing on clarity and theological resonance. I will replace 'is not worthy of me' with 'is unworthy of me' to strengthen the impact. Additionally, I will revise 'take up his cross' to 'bear his cross' to better convey the idea of enduring the burden of discipleship. Finally, I will adjust the overall phrasing for improved flow, ensuring the message remains accessible while retaining the depth of meaning inherent in the original Greek.|
|MAT 10:39|Whoever finds his own life will lose it, and whoever loses his life for my sake will find it.|To refine Matthew 10:39, I will maintain the literal translation while enhancing clarity and personal emphasis. I'll adjust the phrasing to make it more accessible without losing the original meaning. The term 'soul' will be reconsidered for its broader implications regarding discipleship, and I'll ensure that the phrase 'for my sake' is emphasized to highlight its importance in the message. Additionally, I will maintain consistency with the surrounding context to ensure coherence in the overall message about self-sacrifice and discipleship.|
|MAT 10:40|The one who welcomes you welcomes me, and the one who welcomes me welcomes the one who sent me.|This verse emphasizes the close relationship between Jesus, his disciples, and God the Father, highlighting the significance of accepting the messengers of God. The use of 'receiving' in the original Greek reflects both hospitality and the acknowledgment of authority.|
|MAT 10:41|Whoever welcomes a prophet because he is a prophet will receive a prophet's reward, and whoever welcomes a righteous person because he is righteous will receive a righteous person's reward.|The original Greek highlights the concept of receiving and reward based on the recognition of the divine in others. The term 'in the name of' indicates an acknowledgment of their role and authority in Christ, which directly correlates with the reward they will receive. The structure emphasizes a parallelism in both receiving prophets and righteous individuals, maintaining the notion of divine recognition and reward.|
|MAT 10:42|And whoever gives a cup of cold water to one of these little ones in the name of a disciple, truly I say to you, he will not lose his reward.|To improve the fluency and clarity of MAT 10:42, I will focus on rephrasing it for better readability while ensuring that it reflects the original Greek accurately. I will specify the context of 'little ones' as referring to the disciples to underscore their importance in the passage. Furthermore, I will modify the translation of 'because he is my disciple' to 'in the name of a disciple' to preserve the meaning of the original text. Lastly, I will ensure that my translation is original and avoids plagiarism by not replicating any existing translations closely, while still conveying the intended message about kindness and the reward associated with it.|
