|MAT 25:1|Then the kingdom of heaven will be like ten virgins who took their lamps and went out to meet the bridegroom.|This translation emphasizes the imagery of the kingdom of heaven being compared to the ten virgins, highlighting the themes of readiness and expectation in the context of Jesus' parable about the end times and the coming of the bridegroom.|
|MAT 25:2|"Five of them were wise, and five were foolish." 

*Footnote: The term 'foolish' in this context highlights a lack of spiritual preparedness and discernment, serving as a warning about the consequences of neglecting one's readiness for the bridegroom's coming.|The aim is to create a more literal translation of MAT 25:2 by directly translating the original Greek without interpretive phrases. Additionally, I'll ensure that any commentary or insights about the verse are placed in footnotes to maintain the purity of the translation. I will strive to use clear language while making sure that the translation reflects a conservative Christian understanding of wisdom and foolishness in spiritual matters. By focusing on a straightforward translation, I ensure that the original text's meaning remains clear and true to its context.|
|MAT 25:3|"The foolish virgins took their lamps, yet they did not bring oil with them." 
*Footnote: The absence of oil represents a lack of spiritual preparedness, highlighting the crucial themes of vigilance and readiness in anticipation of the bridegroom's coming, as echoed in Matthew 24:44 and Luke 12:35-40.|In this translation of MAT 25:3, I will maintain the term 'foolish virgins' to remain consistent with the original language and its implications. I will rephrase the second part of the sentence to enhance readability while ensuring clarity and flow. The footnote will be refined to emphasize the spiritual significance of oil and the themes of vigilance and preparedness, supported by relevant scriptural references. I will ensure that the final translation is both literal and distinct enough to avoid plagiarism, while still capturing the essence of the passage.|
|MAT 25:4|"But the wise took extra oil with their lamps." 
*Footnote: The inclusion of 'extra oil' signifies the importance of spiritual preparedness and readiness. In the parable, oil symbolizes the necessary resources and faith required to sustain one's spiritual life in anticipation of the bridegroom's arrival.|To enhance the translation of MAT 25:4, I will maintain the literal translation while incorporating a contextual note that elaborates on the significance of 'extra oil.' This will aid readers in understanding the deeper implications of preparedness and spiritual vigilance in the context of the parable. This addition aligns with the instruction to not only translate accurately but to provide clarity for the audience, making the text more accessible and insightful.|
|MAT 25:5|While the bridegroom was delayed, all the virgins became drowsy and fell asleep. 
*Note: This drowsiness signifies a lapse in spiritual vigilance, highlighting the critical necessity for preparedness in anticipation of the bridegroom's arrival.|In revising MAT 25:5, the goal is to create a translation that is faithful to the original Greek while incorporating the spiritual themes of vigilance and preparedness. This requires careful word choice to maintain the literal structure while also clarifying the implications of the drowsiness of the virgins. Ensuring consistency in terminology throughout the translation is key, as is enhancing the overall readability and elegance of the text without losing its original meaning. I'll retain the term 'delayed' for clarity, and adjust the phrasing slightly for fluidity.|
|MAT 25:6|At midnight, a loud shout was heard: 'Look, the bridegroom is coming; go out to meet him!'|In this reflection, the focus is on improving the translation of MAT 25:6 to enhance clarity and urgency while remaining faithful to the original Greek text. The peer review suggestions highlight three main areas for improvement: removing the word 'But' for a more straightforward start, substituting 'behold' with 'look' for better contemporary comprehension, and emphasizing the loudness of the 'shout.' Considering these points, I will craft a revised translation that aims for greater readability and impact without compromising the integrity of the original message.|
|MAT 25:7|Then all those virgins arose and trimmed their lamps.|In this verse, the focus is on the action of the bridesmaids as they prepare their lamps, which is symbolic of readiness and vigilance. The term 'lamps' is often associated with illumination and preparedness throughout biblical literature, indicating the importance of being spiritually alert.|
|MAT 25:8|And the foolish said to the wise, 'Please give us some of your oil, for our lamps are going out.'|In revising MAT 25:8, I will focus on enhancing the literal accuracy of the translation while preserving the context and urgency of the request made by the foolish virgins. Changing 'going dim' to 'are going out' aligns better with the original Greek text and maintains the intended meaning. Additionally, retaining the phrase 'Please give us some of your oil' captures the urgency of their situation effectively. I will ensure that these changes do not obscure the overall message of the parable, which emphasizes the importance of being prepared.|
|MAT 25:9|"But the wise answered, 'We cannot share our oil with you, for there may not be enough for both us and you. Instead, go to those who sell oil and buy some for yourselves.'" 
*Note: This response emphasizes the importance of individual preparedness in faith, reminding us that one’s relationship with God is personal and cannot be shared or borrowed.|To improve MAT 25:9, I will simplify the phrasing to enhance clarity, ensuring that the message remains understandable without altering the original meaning. I will include the term 'foolish' to maintain the contrast with the wise virgins. The translation will emphasize individual responsibility and preparedness without over-explaining the cultural context. I will ensure consistent verb tense and structure for better flow, while still remaining faithful to the Greek syntax for literary fidelity.|
|MAT 25:10|But while they had gone away to purchase oil, the bridegroom came, and the wise virgins entered with him into the wedding feast, and the door was shut.|In revising MAT 25:10, I will aim for a more formal tone by using traditional language, such as referring to 'the ready' instead of 'those who were ready.' I will incorporate the term 'wise virgins' for better resonance with the intended audience. Additionally, I will ensure the translation maintains clarity while staying true to the original Greek structure. Theological implications of preparedness will also be emphasized to reflect conservative interpretations of vigilance in faith. I will strive for literal fidelity where it can be applied effectively without sacrificing readability.|
|MAT 25:11|Later, the other virgins arrived, crying, 'Lord, Lord! Open for us!'
*Footnote: This urgent plea illustrates the desperate condition of the foolish virgins, emphasizing their failure to prepare for the bridegroom's arrival. The repetition of 'Lord, Lord!' signifies their recognition of authority and reflects their critical need for assistance. This moment serves as a poignant reminder within the parable of the necessity for spiritual vigilance and readiness.|In revising MAT 25:11, I will focus on emphasizing the urgency and emotional intensity of the foolish virgins' plea while maintaining a literal translation that reflects the original Greek. I will ensure to retain the repetition of 'Lord' for its significance in biblical texts, as it conveys both urgency and recognition of authority. Additionally, I will adjust the phrasing to enhance clarity while using direct translations that capture the plea's desperation. The footnote will be expanded to highlight the spiritual implications of this moment, underscoring the importance of preparedness in the parable.|
|MAT 25:12|But he answered, 'Truly I say to you, I do not know you.'|In this verse, the phrase 'I do not know you' emphasizes the separation and lack of relationship between the speaker and those addressed. The use of 'know' indicates an intimate understanding and acknowledgment, which in this context suggests rejection due to unpreparedness.|
|MAT 25:13|Therefore, be vigilant, for you do not know the day or the hour when the Son of Man will come.|I will revise Matthew 25:13 by maintaining a literal translation that is faithful to the Greek text while enhancing clarity for modern readers. I will consider using 'watch' or 'be vigilant' to resonate with traditional biblical language and convey urgency. It's important to balance readability and fidelity to the original message, ensuring it reflects conservative Christian values and theological significance.|
|MAT 25:14|For it will be like a man going on a journey, who called his own servants and entrusted to them his possessions.|The phrase 'ἀποδημῶν' is translated as 'going on a journey,' indicating a departure with intent. The term 'ἰδίους δούλους' emphasizes the personal relationship between the master and his servants, reflecting stewardship and trust. This verse sets the stage for the parable of the talents, illustrating themes of responsibility and accountability.|
|MAT 25:15|"To one he entrusted five talents, to another two, and to another one, each according to his own ability; and he departed immediately." 
*Explanatory Note: In this passage, the master, representing God, entrusts his servants with varying amounts of talents, signifying the diverse gifts and resources given to each individual. This parable underscores the responsibility of stewardship, highlighting that these gifts should be utilized faithfully for the advancement of God's purposes.|In updating MAT 25:15, the aim is to incorporate a sense of urgency regarding the master's departure. The phrase 'and he departed immediately' has been selected to enhance the immediacy of the master's actions. The explanatory note has been revised for clarity and brevity while still emphasizing the importance of stewardship and the character of the master as God. Furthermore, the note now highlights the expectation for the servants to manage their entrusted resources wisely, aligning with traditional conservative views.|
|MAT 25:16|Then he who had received the five talents went and traded with them, and made five more talents.|In this translation, I maintained the focus on the active nature of the servant's work with the talents entrusted to him, emphasizing the concept of productivity and return on investment.|
|MAT 25:17|Likewise, the one who had received two talents gained two more.|In this verse, the term 'two' emphasizes the doubling of the investment, paralleling the concept of faithful stewardship found in the parables of the Kingdom. The use of 'made' aligns with the active engagement in trade that shows initiative and responsibility.|
|MAT 25:18|"But the one who had received the single talent went away, dug in the earth, and hid his master's talent."
*Footnote: This action symbolizes a failure in stewardship, highlighting the responsibility to actively use and multiply the gifts entrusted by God.|To effectively incorporate the feedback for MAT 25:18, I will ensure that 'talent' is used consistently throughout the translation, as this aligns with biblical terminology. I will also aim for a more fluid and readable sentence structure while maintaining a formal tone appropriate for scripture. The translation will reflect the literal meaning of the original Greek, particularly focusing on phrases like 'dug in the earth' to emphasize the actions of the servant in the context of stewardship. Additionally, a concise footnote will be included to connect the servant's behavior to the principles of stewardship.|
|MAT 25:19|After a long time, the master of those servants returned and settled accounts with them.|The phrase 'after a long time' reflects the delay of the master’s return, emphasizing the anticipation of accountability among the servants. The term 'the lord of those servants' stresses the authority and ownership of the master over his servants, reinforcing the theme of stewardship and responsibility in the parable.|
|MAT 25:20|And he who had received the five talents approached, bringing five talents more, saying, 'Master, you entrusted me with five talents; see, I have gained five talents more.' 
*Footnote: This response illustrates the faithful stewardship of the servant, who not only returned what was entrusted but also multiplied it, reflecting the expectation of diligence and responsibility in God's kingdom.|In updating MAT 25:20, I will ensure that the terminology for 'talent' is used consistently to avoid any confusion about the subject of the verse. I will also aim for clarity and simplicity by replacing 'in addition to them' with 'more' for better readability. It is essential to maintain the integrity of the translation while integrating a contextual footnote that provides theological reflections on stewardship. This will enrich the understanding of the verse without compromising its primary meaning or flow. I will also adjust the wording to improve readability by rephrasing 'five more talents' to 'five talents more.'|
|MAT 25:21|His master said to him, 'Well done, good and faithful servant! You were faithful over a little; I will set you over much. Enter into the joy of your lord.'|In this verse, the master commends his servant for his faithfulness and productivity. The term 'good and faithful servant' emphasizes the qualities that are valued in God's kingdom. The phrase 'enter into the joy of your lord' signifies a welcoming into a shared celebration and reward for diligent service.|
|MAT 25:22|"And he who had received the two talents came forward, saying, 'Master, you entrusted me with two talents; look, I have earned two more.'" 
*Explanatory Note: This declaration highlights the servant's faithfulness in stewardship, actively working to multiply the resources entrusted to him, thus exemplifying the expectation of diligence and accountability in God's kingdom.|In translating MAT 25:22, I will prioritize clarity and conciseness while ensuring theological emphasis is maintained. I will replace 'behold' with 'look' to enhance modern readability. The phrase 'in addition to them' will be simplified to 'more' for better flow and conciseness. Furthermore, I will ensure that the tone is consistent with surrounding verses, particularly the ones that have similar expressions of stewardship and accountability. Lastly, I will format the explanatory note uniformly with previous ones to maintain clarity in presentation.|
|MAT 25:23|His Lord said to him, 'Well done, good and faithful servant! You were faithful over a little; I will appoint you over much. Enter into the joy of your Lord.'|In light of the feedback provided, the updated translation for MAT 25:23 will prioritize terminology consistency by using 'Lord' with a capital 'L' to reflect reverence. The phrase 'over a few things' will be modified to 'over a little' for clarity. Additionally, the structure of the sentence will be adjusted to align more closely with the original Greek. Modern readability will also be kept in mind, ensuring that the translation remains accessible without losing the essence of the message. Emphasis on stewardship will be reflected in the phrase regarding the Lord's intention to set the servant over many things. Overall, the revised translation will seek to uphold fidelity to the original text while enhancing clarity and reverence for contemporary readers.|
|MAT 25:24|Then he who had received the one talent approached and said, 'Master, I know you to be a hard man, reaping where you did not sow and gathering where you scattered no seed.'|To address the character description, I will change 'harsh man' to 'hard man', which aligns more closely with the Greek term 'σκληρός'. For clarity, I will modify the phrasing to 'I know you to be' to enhance readability. I'll choose to consistently use 'Master' for the translation of 'κύριε' throughout the parable. In doing this, I will ensure the emotional context of the servant's fear is preserved while highlighting his mischaracterization of the Master, emphasizing the theological themes of accountability and judgment. These changes aim to maintain a balance between literal accuracy and theological depth.|
|MAT 25:25|And filled with fear, I went away and hid your talent in the ground; look, here you have what is yours.|This translation emphasizes the servant's fear as a motivating factor for his inaction. The choice of words conveys a sense of both responsibility and reluctance, reflecting the original Greek intent of the passage.|
|MAT 25:26|But his master answered him, ‘You wicked and slothful servant! You knew that I reap where I have not sown and gather where I have not scattered seed!'|In this verse, the master is confronting the servant about his laziness and evil nature. The terms used emphasize the servant's wickedness and the gravity of his inaction. This translation maintains the strong admonitory tone of the original text while using contemporary English.|
|MAT 25:27|Then you should have placed my money with the bankers, and upon my arrival, I would have earned back what was mine with interest.|In reviewing MAT 25:27, I will make sure to replace 'usury' with 'interest' as it aligns better with contemporary understanding and avoids negative implications. I will retain the original phrase about placing the money with the bankers to preserve the meaning while simplifying the language for clarity. It’s also essential to remain faithful to the literal translation and the original intent of the scripture. To enhance reader understanding, I will also note biblical banking practices that could provide insight into the cultural context of the verse.|
|MAT 25:28|"Therefore, take the talent from him and give it to the one who possesses ten talents." 
*Footnote: This command underscores the biblical principles of stewardship and the necessity of responsibility in managing God-given resources, highlighting the consequences of faithfulness and neglect.|To enhance the flow and naturalness of the English translation for MAT 25:28 while maintaining fidelity to the original text, I will aim for a more formal structure that conveys the authority of the master. This involves using more elevated language to reflect the seriousness of the command and ensuring that the footnote reinforces the themes of stewardship and accountability. The goal is to make the translation feel both reverent and clear.|
|MAT 25:29|For to everyone who has, more will be given, and he will have an abundance; but from the one who does not have, even what he has will be taken away from him.|To enhance the translation of MAT 25:29 while maintaining its literal accuracy and theological integrity, I'll focus on refining the phrase regarding what the servant possesses. I will also ensure that the structure flows well and remains clear for contemporary readers. This approach aligns with the conservative Christian perspective on stewardship and accountability. The suggested phrasing 'even what he has will be taken away from him' will provide a more straightforward representation of the original Greek while improving readability.|
|MAT 25:30|And cast out the worthless servant into the outer darkness; there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.|This verse emphasizes the final judgment and the separation between faithful servants and those deemed worthless. The imagery of outer darkness and the gnashing of teeth signifies deep regret and sorrow, which reinforces the seriousness of one's response to God's gifts and calling.|
|MAT 25:31|When the Son of Man comes in His glory, and all the holy angels with Him, then He will sit on His glorious throne.|This verse describes the glorious return of Jesus, the Son of Man, and emphasizes the presence of angels as well as the authority with which He will reign. The term 'glory' (δόξα) signifies the divine majesty and power associated with Christ's second coming.|
|MAT 25:32|And before Him will be gathered all the nations, and He will separate them one from another, just as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats.|This verse employs agricultural and pastoral imagery to illustrate the final judgment, where nations are gathered and separated as a shepherd separates sheep from goats, indicating discernment and authority.|
|MAT 25:33|And He will place the sheep on His right hand, but the goats on His left.|In this verse, the imagery of separating sheep and goats is used to illustrate the distinction between the righteous and the unrighteous at the final judgment. The 'right hand' and 'left hand' signify favor and disfavor respectively. The choice of 'sheep' for the right reflects their value and the notion of care associated with a shepherd's role.|
|MAT 25:34|Then the King will say to those on His right, ‘Come, you blessed of My Father; inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world.|This verse encapsulates the promise of eternal reward for the faithful, drawing on themes of blessing, inheritance, and divine favor that resonate throughout Scripture.|
|MAT 25:35|For I was hungry, and you gave Me food; I was thirsty, and you gave Me drink; I was a stranger, and you took Me in.|In this translation, the terms used convey both the physical and spiritual needs that Christ identifies as acts of kindness toward Him. The verse emphasizes the importance of caring for those in need as an expression of faith.|
|MAT 25:36|"When I was naked, you clothed me; when I was sick, you visited me; when I was in prison, you came to me." 
*Footnote: This verse emphasizes the Christian imperative to show compassion to those in need, illustrating that our treatment of others, especially the marginalized, reflects our service to Christ.|I need to implement the corrections effectively while ensuring that the translation remains faithful to the source text. I will change 'unclothed' to 'naked' for traditional consistency, revert 'came to see me' to 'visited me' for a more impactful translation, and enhance the overall readability while keeping the meaning intact. The footnote should provide context without being too interpretative.|
|MAT 25:37|Then the righteous will answer him, saying, 'Lord, when did we see you hungry and feed you, or thirsty and give you something to drink?'|The verse emphasizes the response of the righteous, highlighting their surprise and confusion at having served Christ through serving the needy. The use of 'Lord' reflects their recognition of His authority, and the terms 'hunger' and 'thirst' signify basic human needs, which relate to the actions they performed. This translation seeks to convey the original meaning without borrowing phrases directly from existing translations.|
|MAT 25:38|When did we see you as a stranger and take you in, or see you naked and provide clothing for you?|The goal is to enhance clarity and fluidity in the translation of MAT 25:38 while staying true to the original Greek text. By changing 'as a stranger' to 'you as a stranger', I will make the subject clearer. Additionally, simplifying 'offer you welcome' to 'welcome you' will create a more direct expression. Overall, the aim is to keep the translation faithful yet more accessible to modern readers, incorporating the significance of welcoming strangers subtly within the context of Christian teachings. This revised translation will focus on maintaining a balance between literal accuracy and readability.|
|MAT 25:39|When did we see you sick or in prison, and come to you?|In translating MAT 25:39, the focus will be on maintaining fidelity to the original Greek while also enhancing clarity. Given the correction's suggestion to use 'sick' instead of 'ill' for a more traditional tone, the updated translation will reflect that choice. Additionally, care will be taken to ensure consistency with the surrounding verses, which will aid in the reader's understanding. This translation will aim for a balance between literalness and readability, following conservative Christian principles.|
|MAT 25:40|And the King will answer them, 'Truly, I say to you, as you did it to one of the least of these my brothers, you did it to me.'|The emphasis of this verse is on the significance of how we treat others, particularly those in need. The use of 'my brothers' emphasizes the familial bond within the body of Christ. The word 'least' highlights the value and dignity of those who are often overlooked in society.|
|MAT 25:41|Then he will say to those on his left, 'Depart from me, you cursed ones, into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels.'|This translation emphasizes the eternal consequence for those who reject Christ and highlights the finality of their separation from God. It reflects the original language's strong admonition against those who live in sin and oppose God's will, making clear that the destination is not only punitive but is also prepared specifically for the devil and his angels.|
|MAT 25:42|For I was hungry, and you did not give me anything to eat; I was thirsty, and you did not give me anything to drink.|This verse highlights the significance of providing for those in need, especially emphasizing hunger and thirst. It serves as a reminder of the call to serve and care for the less fortunate, linking it to one's faith and actions.|
|MAT 25:43|"I was a stranger, and you did not take me in; I was naked, and you did not clothe me; I was sick and in prison, and you did not visit me."|In revising MAT 25:43, I will maintain consistency in word choice by using 'take me in' instead of 'welcome'. This aligns with MAT 25:35 and ensures a coherent message across translations. I will also focus on reducing redundancy by avoiding repetitive phrasing, creating a smoother reading experience. Furthermore, I will enhance the formality of the language to reflect traditional biblical translations while remaining accessible. I will evaluate the necessity of the footnote carefully, prioritizing a literal translation that reflects the theological significance without detracting from clarity. My goal is to ensure that the translation remains concise and clear while being faithful to the original text.|
|MAT 25:44|Then they will also answer Him, saying, 'Lord, when did we see You hungry, or thirsty, or a stranger, or naked, or sick, or in prison, and did not minister to You?'|The current translation of Matthew 25:44 is accurate but can be improved for clarity and to better reflect the Greek text. The suggestion to replace 'did not serve You' with 'did not minister to You' captures the deeper meaning of the term 'διακονέω'. Additionally, slight rephrasing will enhance readability while maintaining theological integrity. Therefore, I will adjust the translation accordingly.|
|MAT 25:45|Then He will respond to them, saying, 'Truly I say to you, as much as you did not do it for one of the least of these, you did not do it for Me.'|In this verse, the emphasis is on the neglect of serving 'the least of these,' which highlights a critical aspect of Christian faith and responsibility towards others. The phrase 'the least of these' represents those who are marginalized and in need, and the implication is that failing to care for them is equivalent to failing to care for Christ Himself. This verse calls attention to the interconnectedness of our actions towards others and our relationship with God.|
|MAT 25:46|And these will go away into eternal punishment, but the righteous into eternal life.|The terms 'eternal punishment' and 'eternal life' are used to denote the ultimate fate of the unrighteous and the righteous, respectively. The Greek word 'κόλασιν' (kolasin) implies punishment or torment, whereas 'ζωὴν' (zoen) denotes life, emphasizing the stark contrast between the outcomes for the two groups.|
