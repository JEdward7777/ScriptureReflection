| Reference | Verse | Translation Notes |
|:---------:|-------|-------------------|
|MAT 24:1|And Jesus went out of the temple; and his disciples approached him to show him the buildings of the temple.|To revise MAT 24:1 effectively, I'll focus on improving the natural flow of the translation while maintaining fidelity to the original Greek text. The aim is to enhance readability and clarity by opting for simpler and more common vocabulary. 'Exhibit' will be changed to 'show' and 'structures' will be replaced with 'buildings', which are more accessible terms in contemporary English. I will also ensure that the essence of the original text remains intact without inserting any subjective interpretations or awkward phrasing.|
|MAT 24:2|But Jesus said to them, "Do you not see all these things? Truly, I say to you, not one stone will be left here upon another, which will not be thrown down."|I will implement the corrections by focusing on providing a strictly literal translation that mirrors the original Greek text. I'll maintain clarity and fluency by using straightforward English without introducing interpretive commentary within the translation. If any commentary is needed, I will ensure it is clearly separated from the translation to maintain the integrity of the text.|
|MAT 24:3|While He was sitting on the Mount of Olives, the disciples approached Him privately, saying, 'Tell us, when will these things be, and what will be the sign of Your coming and of the end of the age?'|To address the corrections for MAT 24:3, I will revise the phrase 'Your return' to 'Your coming' for greater theological clarity while ensuring that the tone and vocabulary remain formal, in alignment with conservative translation standards. I will also ensure grammatical consistency and enhance readability by keeping the structure straightforward and clear. Finally, I will consider adding a phrase like 'Your second coming' for clarity, but I will do so without creating redundancy in terminology. The updated translation will maintain fidelity to the original Greek text while making these adjustments.|
|MAT 24:4|And Jesus answered and said to them, "Take heed that no one deceives you." 

**Commentary**: This verse serves as a vital reminder for believers to remain vigilant against deception and false teachings. Jesus underscores the importance of discernment, encouraging His followers to be aware of those who may come in His name yet lead others astray. In the face of increasing falsehoods, maintaining a firm grasp on truth is essential for faithfulness in the Christian walk.|To address the peer review suggestions for MAT 24:4, I will retain the phrase 'Take heed' to maintain the sense of urgency in the translation. I will consider the alternative phrases, but 'Take heed' aligns well with the intended meaning. To enhance clarity, I will use 'deceives' instead of 'misleads,' which better captures the sense of intentional deceit prevalent in the context of false teachers. I will also explicitly link the warning to the broader theme of discernment, emphasizing the vigilance required in the Christian faith against deception. This approach ensures that the translation is distinct and not overly similar to existing translations while remaining faithful to the source material. The final translation will clearly communicate Jesus's warning and its implications for the believers. Additionally, I will include a brief commentary to connect this warning to the overarching Christian themes of discernment and vigilance against falsehood.|
|MAT 24:5|For many will come in my name, declaring, 'I am the Christ,' and they will lead many astray.|To enhance the translation of MAT 24:5, I will focus on incorporating the suggestions provided while maintaining a formal tone typical of biblical language. This includes separating the quoted speech for clarity and ensuring the translation reflects urgency in the warning about deception. I will also examine the phrase 'in my name' to ensure it conveys both its literal and deeper interpretations without compromising the original meaning.|
|MAT 24:6|And you will hear of wars and rumors of wars. See that you are not troubled, for these things must happen, but the end is not yet.|Based on the peer review feedback, the phrase 'reports of wars' should be revised to 'rumors of wars' to better reflect the urgency implied in the original Greek term 'ἀκοὰς'. Additionally, I will ensure that the overall structure remains clear while making the translation more impactful. Thus, I will refine the wording to enhance clarity without sacrificing fidelity to the source text.|
|MAT 24:7|For nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom, and there will be famines, plagues, and earthquakes in various places.|To refine the translation of MAT 24:7, I will focus on enhancing the formal tone, selecting the most effective word choices, and improving readability while maintaining literal fidelity. I will replace 'pestilences' with 'plagues' to ensure contemporary relevance and clearly express the eschatological themes without altering the essence of the original Greek. The sentence structure will be slightly adjusted to better resonate with traditional biblical translations.|
|MAT 24:8|All these are just the beginning of birth pains.|The phrase 'ἀρχὴ ὠδίνων' can be translated literally as 'the beginning of sorrows' or figuratively as 'the onset of labor pains'. This phrase suggests a sense of urgency and impending events, akin to the distress experienced in childbirth, indicating that what follows is just the start of a series of troubles.|
|MAT 24:9|Then they will deliver you into tribulation and will kill you, and you will be hated by all nations because of my name.|In updating MAT 24:9, the primary goal is to ensure clarity and accuracy while remaining faithful to the original Greek text. The suggested adjustments include replacing 'to be afflicted' with 'into tribulation' or 'persecuted' for better understanding, and changing 'hand you over' to 'they will deliver you' to align closely with the Greek structure. Additionally, it's essential to emphasize the seriousness of the persecution described, reflecting a conservative Christian perspective on the gravity of these events.|
|MAT 24:10|"At that time, many will be led into offense, and they will betray one another and hate one another." 

**Commentary**: In this verse, Jesus forewarns His disciples of a time of great moral and spiritual turmoil. The phrase 'led into offense' highlights the risk of believers turning away from their faith under pressure, leading to betrayals within the community. This reflects a profound warning about the fragility of human relationships and the trials that may test the bonds of love and loyalty among His followers. Such trials are part of the broader eschatological discourse that emphasizes the need for vigilance and perseverance in faith.|To improve the translation of MAT 24:10, I will first consider the suggested correction to replace 'stumble' with 'offend,' as this may better capture the moral implications intended in the original Greek term 'σκανδαλίζονται.' This term conveys not just a literal stumbling but also the idea of causing someone to fall into sin or moral failure. Additionally, I will enhance the fluency of the translation by rephrasing it for better readability in modern English while ensuring the meaning remains faithful to the original text. I will also include a brief commentary on the verse's implications within the broader context of Jesus' teachings, particularly regarding the trials and betrayals that would characterize the time before His return. This will aid in providing a more comprehensive understanding of the verse.|
|MAT 24:11|"And many false prophets will arise and will deceive many."|To update the translation of MAT 24:11, I will maintain the literal accuracy of the original Greek while ensuring the language is clear and concise for modern readers. I will keep the phrase 'false prophets will arise and deceive many' intact to respect the fidelity of the original text. The urgency of this warning will be emphasized in both the translation and the contextual note. Additionally, I will strive for consistency in verb forms and simplify the language without losing the theological depth. Commentary will be limited to keep the focus on the text itself.|
|MAT 24:12|And because lawlessness will increase, the love of many will grow cold.|The goal is to refine the translation of MAT 24:12 for clarity while preserving theological significance. The original translation captures the essence of the verse; however, I will separate the translation from the commentary, making it clearer. I will ensure that the updated translation is concise yet accurate, focusing solely on the text of the verse itself. Additionally, I will provide a succinct commentary that elaborates on the theological implications without detracting from the translation's integrity.|
|MAT 24:13|But the one who perseveres to the end will be saved.|In this translation, the emphasis is on the perseverance of the believer amidst trials and challenges.

The word 'saved' is maintained to reflect the assurance of salvation for those who remain faithful.|
|MAT 24:14|"And this gospel of the kingdom will be preached throughout the entire world as a witness to all nations, and then the end will come."|To create a translation that is faithful to the original Greek text of Matthew 24:14, I will incorporate the corrections suggested. I will replace 'this message of the kingdom' with 'the good news of the kingdom' or 'this gospel of the kingdom' to reflect traditional terminology, and 'will be proclaimed' with 'will be preached' to align with evangelical language. Additionally, I will modify 'as a testimony to all nations' to 'as a witness to all nations' for better clarity. These changes will enhance the readability and accessibility of the translation while ensuring theological integrity and eschatological significance.|
|MAT 24:15|"So when you see the abomination of desolation spoken of by the prophet Daniel standing in the holy place—whoever reads, let him understand—"|I will focus on implementing the recommended corrections for MAT 24:15 by rephrasing 'let the one who reads understand' to 'whoever reads, let him understand' for a more literal translation. I will ensure to maintain the theological significance of 'the abomination of desolation' while clarifying that 'holy place' refers to the Temple. I will keep the language clear and precise, reflecting the need for discernment in interpreting scripture as emphasized in the original text.|

|MAT 24:20|Pray that your escape may not occur in winter or on the Sabbath.|In this verse, Jesus is instructing His followers to pray for their safety during a time of great distress.

The translation emphasizes the urgency of the prayerful request.|
|MAT 24:21|"For then there will be a great tribulation, such as has not occurred since the beginning of the world until now, nor will ever occur."|To refine the translation of MAT 24:21, I will ensure that the essential meaning of the verse is maintained while enhancing readability. The phrase 'great tribulation' will remain prominent as it captures the original Greek text's severity. I will also consider the overall structure for clarity and flow, aligning the translation with conservative theological interpretations without losing the original message. The updates will focus on slight wording adjustments for improved clarity while remaining true to the source text.|
|MAT 24:22|"And if those days were not shortened, no flesh would be saved; but the days will be shortened for the benefit of the elect."|To improve the translation of MAT 24:22, I will ensure that I use 'no flesh' instead of 'no human' to remain faithful to the original Greek text. Additionally, I will rephrase 'for the sake of the elect' to 'for the benefit of the elect' to enhance clarity. I will also consider the overall flow of the sentence and the theological implications of God's intervention in shortening the days. The use of consistent terminology, particularly for the word 'elect', will be prioritized to ensure coherence in the translation. Overall, I aim to maintain a unique phrasing that reflects the meaning of the original text while making it accessible to the intended audience.|

The language used connects with themes of discernment and vigilance against deception within the Christian faith.|
|MAT 24:25|"Behold, I have warned you beforehand."|In this task, the goal is to make the translation of Matthew 24:25 more accessible while retaining fidelity to the original Greek. Given the suggestion to replace 'Lo' with 'Behold,' this aligns well with both contemporary usage and traditional translations, ensuring that the phrase conveys urgency and is more relatable to modern readers. Additionally, the second clause will be simplified to 'I have warned you beforehand' to enhance clarity without losing the original meaning. This choice also helps emphasize the serious nature of the warning, aligning with the intended message of the verse.|
|MAT 24:26|Therefore, if anyone says to you, 'Look, He is in the wilderness,' do not go out; or, 'Look, He is in the inner rooms,' do not believe them.|In order to produce an updated translation for Matthew 24:26 that aligns with the outlined corrections, I will ensure that the use of 'He' is consistent throughout the passage, following the terminology established in previous verses. I will also reassess the phrase 'inner chambers' for its clarity, opting for 'inner rooms' which may resonate better with modern readers. The imperative nature of 'do not believe them' must reflect the urgency of the warning while avoiding redundancy with existing translations. Additionally, I will focus on maintaining a formal tone while enhancing readability and flow, ensuring that the translation remains faithful to the Greek text while being accessible to contemporary audiences.|

The emotional response of 'all the tribes of the earth' underscores the global impact of His return, suggesting a moment of great awe and recognition.|

|MAT 24:44|Therefore, you must be ready, for at an hour you do not expect, the Son of Man comes.|In reworking MAT 24:44, the goal is to modernize the language for clarity while preserving the urgency of the message. By replacing 'the Son of Man cometh' with 'the Son of Man comes,' we align with contemporary English usage.

The use of the term 'faithful' (πιστός) emphasizes reliability, while 'wise' (φρόνιμος) conveys prudence in fulfilling responsibilities.|
|MAT 24:46|Blessed is that servant whom his master finds faithfully fulfilling his responsibilities when he arrives.

*Footnote: This verse emphasizes the critical importance of vigilance and faithfulness in our assigned duties, reflecting the expectation that believers should be prepared for the return of Christ.|In reviewing MAT 24:46, it is essential to enhance clarity while maintaining the literal translation integrity of the text. The phrase 'diligently performing his duties' can be adjusted to reflect a stronger sense of urgency, using 'faithfully fulfilling his responsibilities.' This phrasing retains the literal sense while aligning better with the expectations of being ready for the master's return. I will also ensure consistency in terminology by consistently using 'master' throughout the text. Additionally, the footnote will be revised to provide supportive information without detracting from the main translation.

|MAT 24:48|But if that wicked servant says in his heart, 'My lord delays to come,'|In updating the translation for Matthew 24:48, the goal is to maintain a balance between literal fidelity to the original text and clarity for contemporary readers. Given the feedback from reviewers, I will keep the term 'wicked servant' as it has strong theological implications. The phrase 'thinks to himself' will be adjusted to 'says in his heart' for a more literal rendering that remains clear.

I will replace 'sever' with 'cut him in two' for a more traditional feel while also considering the sensitivity of the imagery. I'll rephrase 'assign him a place' to make it clearer without losing meaning, and I'll ensure the term 'hypocrites' is used consistently. Additionally, I will refine the contextual notes to be concise yet impactful, ensuring they highlight the significance of preparedness and vigilance.
