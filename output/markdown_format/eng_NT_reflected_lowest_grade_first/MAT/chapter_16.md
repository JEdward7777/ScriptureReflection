|:---------:|-------|-------------------|
|MAT 16:1|"And the Pharisees and Sadducees approached Him, testing Him, and asked Him to show us a sign from heaven." [Footnote: The Pharisees and Sadducees were influential religious authorities who often challenged Jesus' legitimacy. Their request for a heavenly sign illustrates their skepticism towards His authority.]|In addressing the instructions for Matthew 16:1, I will rephrase the request made by the Pharisees and Sadducees to enhance clarity and precision. I will change 'show them a sign from heaven' to 'show us a sign from heaven,' aligning with the desire for clarity in language. I will also use 'testing' instead of 'tempting' to reflect the scholarly consensus. I will include a concise footnote that contextualizes the Pharisees and Sadducees without offering interpretive commentary, ensuring that it remains informative but not overwhelming. The translation will maintain a formal tone and flow smoothly while being faithful to the original Greek text. I will ensure that terms accurately reflect the intended meanings and scholarly interpretations of the original language, enhancing readability without redundancy.|
|MAT 16:2|But He answered them, "When evening comes, you say, 'It will be fair weather, for the sky is red.'"|To enhance the readability of Matthew 16:2 while maintaining a literal translation, I will adopt a more conversational tone. This will involve slightly adjusting the phrasing to flow naturally in English. I will also incorporate additional cultural context regarding the ancient weather prediction practices to enrich the audience's understanding. I need to ensure consistent quotation marks and punctuation, reflecting modern writing standards. Furthermore, I will emphasize the contrast that Jesus draws between the physical signs of weather and the spiritual signs they should recognize, thereby deepening the overall meaning. Lastly, I will refine Jesus' speech for clarity while preserving the essence of the original Greek syntax.|
|MAT 16:3|And in the morning, you say, 'Today will be stormy, for the sky is gloomy.' You know how to interpret the appearance of the sky, but you cannot discern the signs of the times.|In this verse, Jesus is rebuking the Pharisees and Sadducees for their inability to discern the spiritual significance of the times they were living in. The term 'hypocrites' (ὑποκριταί) signifies their double standards, where they can read the weather but fail to recognize the signs from God. This translation emphasizes the contrast between their earthly wisdom and spiritual ignorance.|
|MAT 16:4|"A wicked and adulterous generation seeks a sign. No sign will be given to it, except the sign of Jonah the prophet." And He left them and departed. [Footnote: The 'sign of Jonah' refers to Jonah's three days in the belly of the fish, which foreshadows Jesus' own death and resurrection (see Matthew 12:40).]|To achieve clarity and flow in MAT 16:4, I will rephrase the portion about the sign of Jonah to make it more readable. I will also consider using 'evil' instead of 'wicked' while retaining 'adulterous'. The sentence structure can be adjusted by splitting it into two sentences to highlight Jesus' rebuke more effectively. Furthermore, a footnote will be added to explain the theological significance of the 'sign of Jonah' in relation to the resurrection, making it clear for the reader. I'll also streamline footnotes to avoid excessive commentary. Minor fluency edits will be made to ensure accessibility while staying faithful to the original text.|
|MAT 16:5|And when His disciples came to the other side, they had forgotten to bring bread.|This verse captures the moment when the disciples forgot to bring bread after their journey across the lake, highlighting a theme of physical needs and spiritual awareness, especially in the context of their ongoing learning from Jesus.|
|MAT 16:6|But Jesus said to them, "Take heed and beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees."|In this verse, Jesus warns His disciples about the influence of the Pharisees and Sadducees, using 'leaven' as a metaphor for their teachings. The context emphasizes the need for discernment against misleading doctrines.|
|MAT 16:7|But they were discussing among themselves, saying, "It is because we have not brought any bread."|In refining the translation of MAT 16:7, I will replace 'reasoning' with 'discussing' to enhance contemporary understanding. Additionally, I will incorporate nuances that suggest an internal struggle among the disciples. This will help convey their confusion and concern about not bringing bread, while still maintaining fidelity to the original Greek text. The overall aim is to balance clarity with depth.|
|MAT 16:8|But Jesus, knowing their thoughts, said to them, "Why are you thinking within yourselves, O you of little faith, that you did not take any bread?"|To enhance the clarity and tone of MAT 16:8, I will adopt the suggested word choice improvements while ensuring the literal accuracy of the translation. I will replace 'reasoning within yourselves' with 'thinking within yourselves' to better reflect the intended depth of Jesus' challenge. Additionally, I will modify 'that you do not have bread' to 'that you did not take any bread?' for a more direct correlation with the Greek text. I will also emphasize the phrase 'O you of little faith' to convey the seriousness of Jesus' admonition. The overall tone will be formal to reflect the gravity of the scripture.|
|MAT 16:9|"Do you not yet comprehend or recall the five loaves for the five thousand, and how many baskets you collected?" [Footnote: This question underscores the disciples' struggle with spiritual insight, highlighting the importance of understanding and memory in relation to faith and Jesus' miraculous provision.]|To improve the translation of MAT 16:9, I will rephrase the question to reflect a more formal tone, enhancing the overall clarity. Additionally, I will include references to the disciples' lack of spiritual insight to emphasize the theological implications related to understanding and memory. The footnote will be separated for better readability, and I will ensure consistent capitalization and punctuation throughout. Contextual footnotes will be refined to strengthen the connection between Jesus' miracles and the overarching message of the verse, in alignment with conservative Christian perspectives.|
|MAT 16:10|"Nor the seven loaves for the four thousand, and how many baskets did you gather?" [Footnote: The seven loaves for the four thousand highlight Jesus' miraculous provision and serve as a reminder of His authority over physical needs, underscoring the importance of faith in recognizing His identity.]|To enhance MAT 16:10, I will add an explanatory footnote that emphasizes the significance of the seven loaves and four thousand. This will clarify the disciples' lack of understanding of Jesus' authority and the miracles performed. Additionally, I will rephrase 'how many baskets did you collect?' to 'how many baskets did you gather?' for improved clarity. I'll ensure the translation maintains a direct tone to reflect Jesus' conversational style. Finally, I'll strengthen the connection with the surrounding context to show how this verse ties into the larger narrative of the disciples' misunderstanding. Overall, these adjustments aim to enrich the understanding of the text while staying true to the original meaning.|
|MAT 16:11|"How do you not understand that I said to you, 'Take heed of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees,' not concerning bread?" [Footnote: 'Leaven' symbolizes the corrupting influence of the Pharisees and Sadducees' teachings.]|To update MAT 16:11, I will focus on ensuring a literal translation that is faithful to the original Greek while enhancing clarity and readability. I'll avoid interpretative phrases and ensure the theological implications are clear, maintaining alignment with a conservative Christian perspective. Additionally, I will simplify any complex structures without losing the meaning and add a footnote for clarity on metaphorical terms such as 'leaven.'|
|MAT 16:12|Then they understood that He was not warning them to beware of the leaven of bread, but of the teachings of the Pharisees and Sadducees.|In this verse, Jesus is clarifying His warning against the teachings of the Pharisees and Sadducees, which He refers to metaphorically as 'leaven.' The use of the term 'leaven' signifies the pervasive and corrupting influence of their doctrines. The emphasis is on understanding that His warning is spiritual rather than a literal concern about bread.|
|MAT 16:13|And when Jesus came into the region of Caesarea Philippi, He asked His disciples, 'Who do men say that the Son of Man is?'|In this revision of MAT 16:13, I will maintain the term 'the Son of Man' to reflect its theological significance, aligning with traditional terminology. I will adjust the phrasing from 'who do people say' to 'who do men say' to resonate with conventional translations while retaining the original meaning. Furthermore, I will ensure that the translation mirrors the Greek syntax as closely as possible for clarity and reverence. Additionally, I will provide contextual insights about the significance of both the term 'the Son of Man' and the location of 'Caesarea Philippi', enhancing the understanding for readers who may not be familiar with these elements.|
|MAT 16:14|And they said, 'Some say John the Baptist, others say Elijah, and still others say Jeremiah or one of the prophets.'|This verse indicates the varied opinions of the people about Jesus' identity, comparing Him to significant prophetic figures in Israel's history. The use of names like John, Elijah, and Jeremiah signifies the recognition of Jesus as a prophet, yet also shows the lack of understanding of His true nature as the Messiah.|
|MAT 16:15|He said to them, 'But who do you say that I am?'|To enhance the translation of Matthew 16:15, I will focus on preserving the rhetorical weight of the question posed by Jesus, ensuring it is both impactful and straightforward. This involves selecting words that maintain the original intent while making it accessible for modern readers. I will ensure that the translation reflects the theological significance of Peter's recognition of Jesus as the Messiah, which is central to the text's message.|
|MAT 16:16|Simon Peter responded, "You are the Christ, the Son of the Living God."|To translate MAT 16:16, I will focus on clarity and fidelity to the original text while ensuring the translation is distinct and does not resemble existing versions. I will retain key theological phrases like 'the Living God' to maintain conservative interpretations. This verse is pivotal in affirming Jesus' identity, so the translation must reflect that significance. I will also avoid lengthy constructions that could obscure the meaning, favoring straightforward language that respects traditional Christian terminology.|
|MAT 16:17|And Jesus answered him, "Blessed are you, Simon, son of Jonah, for this was not revealed to you by flesh and blood, but by My Father who is in heaven." [Footnote: 'Blessed are you' emphasizes the special favor from God due to Peter's insight, which transcends human understanding.]|In revising Matthew 16:17, I will retain the reverent phrasing of 'Blessed are you,' while providing a succinct explanation in the footnote to clarify its theological significance. I will ensure that the literal translation captures the original Greek meaning without introducing any confusing alternatives. The phrase 'this was not revealed to you by flesh and blood' will be kept intact to reflect divine revelation clearly. Additionally, I will streamline the language for better readability, focusing on maintaining accuracy and avoiding redundancy with previous versions. Finally, I will check for consistency with prior translations to ensure no previous changes are mistakenly reverted.|
|MAT 16:18|And I say to you that you are Peter, and upon this rock I will build My church, and the gates of Hades will not overpower it.|In revising Matthew 16:18, I will incorporate the suggested corrections while striving to maintain a literal translation. By directly translating 'κἀγὼ' as 'And I', I will emphasize Jesus' authoritative voice. Using 'Hades' instead of 'hell' aligns with theological accuracy and helps convey the correct concept of the underworld in this context. To enhance clarity, I will ensure that readers understand the metaphorical significance of 'the gates of Hades'. Additionally, I'll provide contextual interpretation that reinforces the verse's theological implications without detracting from the literal translation. This approach will ensure that the translation is both faithful to the source text and accessible to modern readers.|
|MAT 16:19|And I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven; whatsoever you bind on earth shall be bound in heaven, and whatsoever you loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.|To enhance the translation of MAT 16:19, I will adopt a more formal register, particularly with the phrase 'whatsoever', which will improve precision. Additionally, I will emphasize the authority connected to the 'keys of the kingdom of heaven'. This will involve a slight restructuring of the sentence to clarify the significance of the binding and loosing actions. Lastly, I will maintain consistency with other translations where possible while ensuring that this new rendering remains distinct and original.|
|MAT 16:20|Then He commanded His disciples not to tell anyone that He was the Christ.|In this verse, Jesus instructs His disciples to refrain from publicly declaring His identity as the Messiah, emphasizing the necessity of secrecy regarding His true nature at this stage in His ministry. The directive implies a deliberate control over the revelation of His messianic identity.|
|MAT 16:21|From that time onward, Jesus began to reveal to His disciples that He must go to Jerusalem and suffer many things from the elders, chief priests, and scribes, and be killed, and on the third day rise again.|In this verse, Jesus begins to explicitly inform His disciples about His impending suffering and death. Key elements include the necessity of His journey to Jerusalem and the suffering He is to endure at the hands of religious authorities, culminating in His resurrection on the third day. The word 'must' emphasizes the divine necessity of these events in salvation history.|
|MAT 16:22|And Peter took Him aside and began to rebuke Him, saying, 'Let this not be so, Lord; this shall never happen to You!'|In revising Matthew 16:22, I aim to preserve the emotional intensity of Peter's rebuke while also ensuring the translation remains literal and accessible. I will change 'Far be it from You' to 'Let this not be so,' which conveys urgency and aligns better with contemporary language. The term 'rebuke' will be retained to maintain the intensity of Peter's correction, reflecting his misunderstanding of Jesus's mission. Additionally, I will use 'took Him aside' to directly express the action Peter undertook, ensuring it captures the nuance of the situation. Finally, I will review the theological implications to ensure Peter's misunderstanding is evident without losing clarity. This approach should satisfy all the correction instructions effectively.|
|MAT 16:23|But He turned and said to Peter, "Get behind Me, Satan! You are a stumbling block to Me, for you are not considering the things of God, but the things of men."|In reworking MAT 16:23, I focused on maintaining the original tone of Jesus' strong rebuke, ensuring it is both literal and clear. The phrase 'Get behind Me, Satan!' is crucial for its impact and theological significance, and I preserved it as is. For 'stumbling block,' I explored variations but concluded that it conveys the essential idea effectively. I refined the latter part to draw a clearer distinction between divine and human priorities while maintaining theological integrity. Additionally, I ensured that the translation is readable and resonates with a conservative Christian audience without diluting the original meaning.|
|MAT 16:24|Then Jesus said to His disciples, "If anyone wants to follow Me, let him deny himself, take up his cross, and follow Me."|This verse emphasizes the necessity of self-denial and commitment for those who wish to follow Jesus. The call to take up one’s cross signifies embracing challenges and sacrifices for the sake of discipleship, which aligns with the broader theme of commitment in the teachings of Jesus.|
|MAT 16:25|For whoever wishes to save his life will lose it; but whoever loses his life for my sake will find it. [Note: This verse emphasizes the paradox of Christian discipleship, illustrating that true life is found through self-denial in following Christ.]|To create an updated translation of Matthew 16:25 that maintains faithfulness to the original Greek text while also improving clarity and flow, I will consider the following: I will ensure that the phrasing captures the intended meaning of the original text, adjusting 'whoever desires' to 'whoever wishes' for clarity. I'll also strive to align the syntax with the Greek structure to uphold the integrity of the original message. Additionally, I will keep the theological note to provide context without overwhelming the main text. Finally, I will avoid casual contemporary language to maintain a formal tone.|
|MAT 16:26|For what will it profit a man if he gains the whole world but loses his own soul? Or what will a man give in exchange for his soul?|This verse emphasizes the futility of gaining worldly possessions at the cost of one’s soul. The use of 'world' signifies all earthly wealth and pleasures, while 'soul' denotes the eternal aspect of humanity. The rhetorical questions challenge the reader to consider the true value of life and what one might sacrifice for material gain.|
|MAT 16:27|For the Son of Man is about to come in the glory of His Father with His angels, and then He will repay each one according to his works. [Footnote: This verse highlights the impending final judgment and the individual accountability of each person before God, emphasizing the necessity of living a life reflective of one’s faith.]|To revise MAT 16:27, I will focus on simplifying the sentence structure for clarity, while ensuring that the theological depth remains intact. I will use a more literal phrase such as 'according to his works' for better alignment with the original Greek text. The emphasis on judgment will be strengthened by adding explanatory notes to underscore themes of final accountability. I will ensure consistency in terminology, particularly with terms like 'the Son of Man' and 'works.' Lastly, I will address any grammatical issues and enhance explanatory notes without detracting from the original meaning.|
|MAT 16:28|"Truly, I say to you, there are some standing here who will not taste death until they see the Son of Man coming in His kingdom." 

[Contextual Note: This verse underscores the immediacy of Jesus' proclamation about His kingdom, foreshadowing the coming revelation of His glory in the transfiguration. It invites reflection on the anticipation of witnessing God's reign in Christ.]|In light of the feedback from the peer review, I will focus on making the translation of Matthew 16:28 more readable while maintaining fidelity to the original Greek text. I will emphasize the urgency of Jesus' statement and ensure that the translation aligns with conservative Christian theological perspectives. Additionally, I will refine the contextual note for clarity and brevity, while still conveying the significance of the verse in the context of the kingdom of God and the transfiguration.|
