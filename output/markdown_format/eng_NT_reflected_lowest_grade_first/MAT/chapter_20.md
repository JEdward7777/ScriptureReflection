| Reference | Verse | Translation Notes |
|:---------:|-------|-------------------|
|MAT 20:1|"For the kingdom of heaven is like a householder who went out early in the morning to hire laborers for his vineyard." <br><br>*Footnote: This parable illustrates the nature of God's kingdom and His desire to include all people in His work, highlighting themes of grace and generosity.|I will maintain the use of 'householder' for accuracy and convey the urgency of the householder's actions in hiring laborers for the vineyard. I will focus on presenting a clear, literal translation without interpretative commentary within the translation itself. Any theological implications will be moved to a footnote to keep the translation pure and direct.|
|MAT 20:2|And having agreed with the laborers for a denarius for the day, he sent them into his vineyard.|In this verse, the emphasis is on the agreement made between the landowner and the laborers regarding their wage for the day. The use of the term 'denarius' signifies a standard daily wage, indicating fairness and contractual obligation.|
|MAT 20:3|And having gone out about the third hour, he saw others standing idle in the marketplace.|The focus for this verse is to achieve a literal translation that accurately reflects the original Greek text while improving clarity and fluency. I will eliminate interpretive phrases and simplify the wording. Using 'standing idle' is preferred to maintain the original meaning, and using 'unemployed' could be reconsidered but may introduce negative connotations. Ultimately, I'll retain the term 'idle' for its neutrality. Additionally, I will ensure that the sentence structure is clear and that the translation flows well in English, preserving a formal biblical tone.|
|MAT 20:4|And he said to them, 'Go into the vineyard as well, and I will give you what is right.'|To address the provided corrections for MAT 20:4, I will prioritize the following: 1) Revising the word choice from 'just' to 'right' for better theological clarity and alignment with traditional biblical language; 2) Ensuring the plural nature of the audience is clear by using 'you all'; 3) Maintaining straightforward sentence structure while enhancing the imperative 'Go'; 4) Rephrasing to avoid ambiguity, particularly in how the landowner's promise is conveyed; and 5) Keeping a formal tone to reflect the seriousness of the context. The revised translation will reflect these considerations while adhering closely to the original Greek text.|
|MAT 20:5|They went out again. About the sixth and the ninth hour, he did the same.|In this verse, the action of going out again and employing workers reflects the ongoing nature of the vineyard owner’s effort to find laborers, emphasizing both persistence and grace in hiring those who have not yet worked.|
|MAT 20:6|"And about the eleventh hour, he went out and found others idle, and he said to them, 'Why have you remained here idle all day?'"|I will refine the translation of MAT 20:6 by changing 'standing idle' to 'idle' to enhance readability, while also restructuring the question to sound more formal. I aim to maintain the meaning of the original Greek text and align with the literary tone expected in biblical texts. I will ensure that the revised phrasing still reflects the original intent of the parable, capturing the essence of the situation depicted in the scripture.|
|MAT 20:7|They answered Him, 'No one has hired us.' He said to them, 'Go into the vineyard too, and you will receive what is just.'|In revising Matthew 20:7, I aim to incorporate the specified corrections while ensuring that the translation remains faithful to the original Greek text. The choice of 'what is just' instead of 'what is right' aligns with traditional theological interpretations, and using 'idle' provides a more accurate description of the laborers' state. I will maintain the phrase 'you will receive' for clarity regarding future actions, and I will keep 'the vineyard' for formality and respect towards the biblical context. Overall, the goal is to ensure the translation is both literal and readable for modern audiences while adhering closely to the source material.|
|MAT 20:8|When evening had come, the owner of the vineyard said to his steward, ‘Call the laborers and render them their wages, starting from the last to the first.’|In refining MAT 20:8, I will prioritize a more literal expression for 'pay them their wages', replacing it with 'render them their wages' for accuracy. I will also ensure consistent terminology by retaining 'laborers' and using 'owner of the vineyard' to align with traditional conservative language. Furthermore, I will adjust the phrasing slightly to enhance readability while preserving the formal tone necessary for this translation. This approach maintains fidelity to the original Greek and ensures clarity for the reader.|
|MAT 20:9|And those who came about the eleventh hour received a denarius each.|This verse describes the moment when the workers who came late in the day received their wages. The use of 'denarius' indicates the standard wage for a day's work, and the context highlights the generosity of the vineyard owner.|
|MAT 20:10|But when the first came, they assumed they would receive more, yet they also received each a denarius.|In this translation, the word choices aim to convey the original Greek sense of expectation versus reality, particularly reflecting the surprise of the first workers regarding their payment. The phrase 'thought they would receive more' highlights the contrast between expectation and the outcome.|
|MAT 20:11|And upon receiving their payment, they began to complain against the landowner.|In reviewing MAT 20:11, I will focus on making word choice adjustments to reflect a more accurate emotional response to the actions of the laborers. I will replace 'grumble' with 'complain' to capture the intensity of their dissatisfaction. Additionally, I will change 'master of the house' to 'landowner' for clearer contextual alignment with the original Greek term 'οἰκοδεσπότου'. This adjustment will help maintain clarity for readers who may not be familiar with the term. I will also ensure that the phrasing emphasizes the nature of their complaint without altering the meaning, thus ensuring theological consistency and overall clarity.|
|MAT 20:12|saying, 'These last worked only one hour, and you have made them equal to us, who have borne the burden of the day and the heat of the sun.'|To update Matthew 20:12, I will focus on maintaining fidelity to the original text while enhancing clarity and flow in English. I'll ensure that the phrase 'made them equal to us' is preserved to reflect the Greek nuance accurately. Additionally, I will replace 'the heat of the day' with 'the heat of the sun' to create a more vivid image. I will also provide context about grace and equality in the translation to reflect conservative Christian theological themes. Lastly, I will make minor adjustments for consistency with the surrounding translations while avoiding direct plagiarism.|
|MAT 20:13|But he answered one of them, 'Friend, I do you no wrong; did we not agree on a denarius?'|The goal is to create a translation for MAT 20:13 that maintains literal fidelity to the original Greek text while enhancing clarity and readability. To address the first point, I will rephrase 'I am not wronging you' to 'I do you no wrong' to keep the meaning clear. The term 'Companion' will be replaced with 'Friend' to better reflect the relational tone of the dialogue. The phrase 'did we not come to an agreement for a denarius?' will be simplified to 'Did we not agree on a denarius?' to improve directness and flow. I will ensure the translation is distinct from other versions, avoiding familiar phrases and focusing on conveying the parable's moral lesson with clarity. Minor stylistic adjustments will be made to ensure the tone reflects conservative Christian values, and overall readability is enhanced.|
|MAT 20:14|'Take what is yours and go; I wish to give to this last one as I have given to you.'|To address the correction points for MAT 20:14, I will focus on enhancing the word choice to reflect divine authority and ensuring the language is formal and reverent. The original phrase 'I choose to give' will be replaced with 'I wish to give' to maintain fidelity to the Greek term 'θέλω.' Furthermore, I will aim for succinctness and clarity while preserving the Greek syntax, making the translation accessible yet resonant with traditional biblical language. The themes of grace and divine generosity will be emphasized to align with the theological context of the parable, and care will be taken to ensure originality in phrasing to avoid plagiarism from existing translations.|
|MAT 20:15|'Is it not lawful for me to do as I wish with what belongs to me? Or is your eye evil because I am good?'|In translating MAT 20:15, the focus is on maintaining clarity while ensuring fidelity to the original Greek. The phrase 'what is mine' will be replaced with 'what belongs to me' for a more literal rendering. Additionally, I will evaluate the word choice for 'envy' in context, preferring 'evil eye' which aligns with traditional interpretations of 'πονηρός'. The overall structure will be kept straightforward to aid comprehension, with attention to theological nuances surrounding God's goodness and justice. Overall, the aim is to enhance the readability and theological precision of the translation.|
|MAT 20:16|"So the last will be first, and the first last; for many are called, but few chosen."|In this reflection, I will focus on providing a literal translation of Matthew 20:16 that adheres strictly to the original Greek text without adding interpretative commentary. The current translation strays by including additional phrases that could imply theological interpretations, which contradicts the goal of a straightforward and faithful translation. Therefore, I will omit any phrases not present in the source text and aim for clarity and fidelity to the original scripture. The verse, as it stands, emphasizes the reversal of expectations in the kingdom of God, which should be reflected directly in the translation.|
|MAT 20:17|And as Jesus was ascending to Jerusalem, He took His twelve disciples aside privately on the road and said to them:|To achieve a more faithful and respectful translation of MAT 20:17, I will focus on enhancing the personal connection between Jesus and His disciples by using 'His twelve disciples.' Additionally, I will revise 'along the way' to a more literal rendering, 'on the road.' This approach maintains a formal tone while ensuring clarity and readability. Lastly, I will integrate a reverent style in the overall presentation of the translation, in keeping with conservative Christian values.|
|MAT 20:18|Behold, we are going up to Jerusalem, and the Son of Man shall be delivered to the chief priests and the scribes, and they shall condemn Him to death.|To revise MAT 20:18, I will retain the term 'delivered' to emphasize the nature of Jesus' sacrifice, while considering 'betrayed' for a more nuanced understanding of the events. The translation will flow smoothly while maintaining literal fidelity. I will use 'shall' to align with traditional biblical language, which adds a sense of gravity to the future tense. My aim is to ensure clarity and theological depth without straying into plagiarism, while making the text resonate with a conservative Christian audience.|
|MAT 20:19|and they will deliver Him to the Gentiles to be ridiculed, scourged, and crucified; and on the third day, He shall rise again.|In revising MAT 20:19, the goal is to enhance the clarity and solemnity of the passage while ensuring theological accuracy and distinctiveness from existing translations. I will rephrase key phrases to convey the seriousness of the events surrounding Jesus' suffering, using traditional biblical language to appeal to a conservative Christian audience. Additionally, I will emphasize the themes of suffering and resurrection, making them clear and significant in the translation.|
|MAT 20:20|Then the mother of James and John, the sons of Zebedee, approached Him, kneeling and asking Him, 'Let these two sons of mine sit, one at Your right and one at Your left in Your kingdom.'|In revising Matthew 20:20, the focus will be on maintaining a literal translation while improving clarity and fidelity to the source text. The specific request by the mother will be expressed more directly, emphasizing the positions she desires for her sons. Additionally, keeping the reverent tone and flow of the original narrative is important. Given these considerations, the updated translation will include the direct phrasing regarding the sons' positions and slightly enhance readability without losing the essence of the original text.|
|MAT 20:21|And He said to her, 'What do you wish?' She said to Him, 'Grant that these two sons of mine may sit, one on Your right hand and the other on Your left, in Your kingdom.'|In this verse, the request of the mother of the sons of Zebedee reflects the common aspiration for honor and position within the kingdom, highlighting a key theme of ambition and recognition in the teachings of Jesus. The phrase 'sit on your right hand and on your left' is a metaphorical expression indicating a desire for the highest status alongside Jesus.|
|MAT 20:22|But Jesus answered and said, 'You do not know what you are asking. Are you able to drink the cup that I am about to drink, or be baptized with the baptism with which I am to be baptized?' They said to Him, 'We are able.'|In this verse, Jesus speaks to the disciples about their understanding of the suffering and sacrifice associated with His impending death. The terms 'cup' and 'baptism' are metaphors for the trials He will face. The translation seeks to convey both the inquiry of Jesus and the disciples' assertive response while maintaining a reverent tone appropriate for the text.|
|MAT 20:23|And He said to them, 'You will indeed drink from My cup and be baptized with the baptism with which I am to be baptized; but sitting at My right and left hand is not for Me to grant, but is for those whom My Father has prepared.'|To enhance the clarity of Matthew 20:23, I will simplify complex phrases and ensure fluidity while maintaining the theological essence of Jesus's message. I will integrate the idea of divine authority and the preparation by the Father more smoothly into the text, rather than as a separate note. Additionally, I will ensure originality to avoid plagiarism of other translations while remaining true to the original Greek. I will also consider the textual variations regarding the phrase about preparation to give readers a comprehensive understanding of the verse's reliability.|
|MAT 20:24|"And when the ten heard this, they became greatly indignant against the two brothers."|To enhance the emotional tone of the verse, I will replace 'greatly displeased' with 'greatly indignant' to reflect the stronger emotional reaction of the disciples. I will also focus on maintaining clarity while using a fluid expression that modern readers can easily understand. Adding a contextual commentary will help the audience grasp the dynamics of the disciples' feelings in this moment, highlighting the tension among them after hearing the request of James and John's mother. I will ensure that the effective language choices from prior versions are preserved, contributing to a translation that is both accurate and impactful.|
|MAT 20:25|But Jesus called them to Himself and said, 'You know that the rulers of the Gentiles exercise authority over them, and their great ones govern them.'|To revise MAT 20:25, I will focus on maintaining the formal tone that resonates with traditional scripture language while also enhancing clarity and accuracy. The phrase 'leaders of the nations' will be changed to 'rulers of the Gentiles' to align with common conservative translations, which also resonates with the historical context of authority structures in the biblical narrative. Additionally, I'll refine 'great ones hold authority' to 'govern' to simplify comprehension while maintaining reverence. This approach honors the text's intent while remaining accessible to modern readers.|
|MAT 20:26|It will not be this way among you; rather, whoever wishes to be great among you must become your servant.|To improve the translation of MAT 20:26, I will incorporate the suggested corrections. I will adjust the phrasing for clarity while keeping the essential meaning intact. I'll focus on using more direct language and ensuring that the essence of servanthood is preserved. The revised translation will aim for a balance between literal fidelity to the Greek text and readability for contemporary audiences.|
|MAT 20:27|And whoever desires to be first among you shall be your servant.|In light of the peer review feedback, I will revise MAT 20:27 by changing 'wishes' to 'desires' to create a more idiomatic expression. I will also introduce a more formal tone to the translation, enhancing the themes of humility and servanthood that are central to this passage. Furthermore, I will adjust the phrasing for improved flow and readability while ensuring that the meaning of the original text remains intact. The revised translation should reflect a more reverent tone appropriate for a conservative Christian context.|
|MAT 20:28|Just as the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give His life as a ransom for many.|This translation seeks to capture the servant-leader nature of Christ, emphasizing His mission of service and sacrifice. The term 'ransom' is vital in understanding the theological implications of Christ's death.|
|MAT 20:29|And as they were going out from Jericho, a great multitude followed Him.|To refine the translation of Matthew 20:29 while ensuring it remains faithful to the original Greek text, I will consider the contextual significance of Jericho and the act of the crowd following Jesus. Additionally, I will enhance the phrasing for better flow, ensuring it aligns with biblical terminology and maintains originality to avoid copyright issues. The focus will be on conveying the importance of the event as well as keeping a formal structure. I will also look at the narrative context to ensure that the translation reflects the urgency and attention of the crowd following Jesus.|
|MAT 20:30|Look, two blind men were sitting by the roadside, and when they heard that Jesus was passing by, they called out, saying, 'Lord, Son of David, show mercy to us!'|To enhance the translation of MAT 20:30, I will incorporate suggestions that modernize the language while preserving the traditional biblical tone. I will substitute 'And behold' with 'Look' for better accessibility. Additionally, I will adjust 'have mercy on us' to 'show mercy to us' to maintain a literal interpretation, while being mindful of the urgency expressed in the plea. I will also change 'they cried out' to 'they called out' for improved clarity. This way, the translation remains faithful to the original Greek text and accurately conveys the characters' emotional urgency and context.|
|MAT 20:31|But the crowd rebuked them, telling them to be silent; yet they cried out all the more, 'Lord, Son of David, have mercy on us!'|In this update for MAT 20:31, I will implement the following changes based on the provided corrections: I will simplify the phrase 'admonished them sharply' to 'rebuked' for clarity and directness. I will ensure consistent terminology by sticking with 'crowd' instead of 'multitude' to align with the preceding verses. I will preserve the emotional urgency of the blind men's plea while being cautious with wording, avoiding phrases that imply interpretation, such as 'with even greater urgency'. I will clarify the sentence structure for better readability without losing the literal essence of the original text. I will avoid any repetition of phrases altered in previous versions.|
|MAT 20:32|And Jesus stood still and called to them, saying, 'What is it that you wish for Me to do for you?'|To enhance MAT 20:32 while maintaining faithfulness to the original text, I will adopt more traditional biblical language to resonate with conservative readers. The inquiry will be rephrased to evoke a more formal tone, emphasizing the significance of Jesus' action of standing still. Additionally, I'll strive to create a fluid and readable translation while ensuring clarity and emotional engagement. This will involve using phrases that sound more biblical yet retain the directness of the original.|
|MAT 20:33|They said to Him, 'Lord, that our eyes might be opened.'|In revising Matthew 20:33, I need to focus on maintaining fidelity to the original Greek while ensuring clarity in modern English. I will implement the suggested changes by using 'that our eyes might be opened' to convey a sense of hope and possibility, which aligns well with the request of the blind men. It's important to keep the reverence in the address 'Lord' to reflect their respect for Jesus. Additionally, I will add a note to highlight the emotional weight of their plea and how it reflects Jesus's compassionate nature in his healing ministry.|
|MAT 20:34|Moved with compassion, Jesus touched their eyes; immediately their sight was restored, and they followed Him.|The phrase 'σπλαγχνισθεὶς' conveys deep compassion, and the verb 'ἥψατο' indicates a physical touch. In this context, Jesus's action of touching their eyes signifies not just healing, but also a profound act of compassion that results in immediate restoration of sight. This emphasizes both His power and His mercy.|
