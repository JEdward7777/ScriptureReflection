|JHN 3:1|One night, a man named Nicodemus came to see Jesus. He was a Pharisee, which means he was a teacher of God's laws and a leader of the Jewish people. Nicodemus wanted to learn more about God and believed that Jesus came from God, so he had important things he wanted to ask Him.|I will revise the translation to include more context about Nicodemus's role as a Pharisee and leader, making it clear and simple for a seven-year-old. I will also simplify the phrasing regarding his intentions and remove complexity to enhance clarity. Lastly, I will aim to keep the language engaging while ensuring it remains accessible to young readers.|
|JHN 3:2|One night, Nicodemus, a teacher and leader of the Jewish people, came to see Jesus quietly. He wanted to learn more about Him. He said, 'Rabbi, we know you are someone sent by God because you do amazing things. No one could do those things unless God is helping him.' A Rabbi is a teacher who shows people how to know God better.|In updating the translation for John 3:2, I need to ensure that the essence of Nicodemus's character and his respectful, curious nature is maintained. I should also emphasize the significance of his nighttime visit to convey his desire for privacy while still keeping the language simple and age-appropriate. Simplifying the term 'incredible miracles' to something more relatable for a child will help with understanding. I'll also ensure the explanation of 'Rabbi' remains, as it aids comprehension for young readers. Finally, I need to keep the tone engaging for a seven-year-old.|
|JHN 3:3|Jesus answered him, 'You must be born again to see God's kingdom. This means you need to start fresh in your heart with God, which is like getting a special new beginning. It’s about changing your life and getting to know God so you can be with Him forever in heaven.'|To revise the translation of John 3:3, I will incorporate the feedback from the corrections provided by my teachers. The goal is to maintain the original meaning while ensuring it is clear and accessible to a seven-year-old. I will use the term 'born again' to connect better with traditional terminology, clarify what 'above' means, and refine the tone to emphasize the importance of spiritual transformation without sounding casual. I will keep the relational aspect of knowing God and ensure it flows from the previous verse about Nicodemus's encounter with Jesus.|
|JHN 3:4-5|Nicodemus was still confused and asked Jesus, "How can an old person be born again? Can they go back inside their mom's tummy to be born again?" Jesus answered, "Listen carefully! No one can see God's Kingdom unless they are born again. This means they need to start a new life with God. When someone believes in me, they start to know God better. God's Spirit helps them change on the inside. Then, when they get baptized, it shows everyone that they believe in me and want to follow my way. Baptism is very important because it shows they are obeying God and starting fresh. This is how we can be with God forever!"|To create a paraphrase suitable for a seven-year-old, I need to simplify the language while keeping the core message intact. I will ensure that the concepts of being 'born again', the role of the Holy Spirit, and the importance of baptism are clear and relatable. Emphasizing baptism as an act of obedience will align with conservative Christian teachings and ensure clarity for a young audience.|
|JHN 3:6|When a baby is born, they come from their mom, which is just a normal way to be born. But when someone believes in Jesus, it’s like getting a special new start from God’s Spirit! This means that they change on the inside to become more like Jesus. When we get baptized, it shows everyone that we believe in Jesus and want to follow Him. This new life helps us love like God loves us, and it brings us into His family where we learn to share that love with everyone around us!|To enhance understanding, I will focus on simplifying key theological terms such as 'born again' and 'born of the Spirit' while maintaining the context from verses 4 and 5. I will emphasize the importance of baptism and the idea of a new life with God in a way that resonates with a seven-year-old's comprehension level. Additionally, I will ensure that phrases like 'regular birth' do not downplay the significance of spiritual rebirth.|
|JHN 3:7|You need to understand that everyone has to be born again to be a part of God's special family. When we believe in Jesus, it's like getting a wonderful new beginning from God's Spirit. This new life helps us to feel love in our hearts and learn to share that love with others. It shows that we want to follow Jesus and be close to God!|In updating the translation of John 3:7, I want to ensure that the essential concept of being 'born again' is emphasized clearly for young readers. I will keep the language simple and relatable while explaining the significance of 'God's family.' Additionally, I will make sure that the revised translation flows well with the preceding verse, maintaining a focus on God's love and the transformative power of faith in Jesus.|
|JHN 3:8|The Holy Spirit is like the wind; you can’t see it, but you can feel it. Just like how you feel a nice breeze on your face, you can feel the Holy Spirit working in your heart when you believe in Jesus. He helps you love God and others in a special way. Even though we don’t see Him and don’t always know where He comes from or where He goes, you can feel the amazing changes He makes in your life. The Holy Spirit is a special gift from God, guiding and helping you as you learn to follow Jesus!|In revising the translation of John 3:8, I want to ensure that I emphasize the concept of being 'born of the Spirit' more clearly while maintaining the relatable analogy of the wind. I will keep the focus on the transformative work of the Holy Spirit in a child's life, which aligns with conservative Christian teachings. I will also clarify the mysterious aspect of the Holy Spirit's work, as it is important to reflect that we do not fully understand where He comes from or goes to, while still being able to feel His presence. Overall, the goal is to create a clear, engaging, and biblically accurate paraphrase suitable for a seven-year-old.  I will also maintain a positive tone to encourage young believers. |
|JHN 3:9|Nicodemus was a smart teacher who was curious about what Jesus meant. He scratched his head and asked, "How can someone be born again? What does that even mean?" He couldn’t see how trusting in Jesus could change someone’s heart. Just like you can’t see the wind but can feel it blowing on your face, the Holy Spirit works inside of us when we believe in Jesus. When we have faith in Him, He helps us feel new inside and teaches us to love God and others better every day!|In the updated translation, I will introduce Nicodemus in a more engaging way, highlight his role as a teacher, and ensure the transformation through faith in Jesus is clear. I'll also connect it better to the work of the Holy Spirit as described in JHN 3:8 without being repetitive. The goal is to keep it simple and relatable for a seven-year-old.|
|JHN 3:10|Jesus answered, 'You are a teacher of God’s people, but you don’t understand what it means to be born again. It’s really important to know that when we trust in Jesus, the Holy Spirit helps change our hearts and makes us feel new inside.'|I need to simplify the language to make it clear and accessible for a seven-year-old. I'll make sure to incorporate the concept of the Holy Spirit and the transformative power of faith in Jesus without adding too much interpretation. I will avoid phrases that imply a directive, focusing instead on the importance of being born again and how Jesus changes our hearts.|
|JHN 3:11-12|"I want to share something really important! We talk about what we know about God, but some people still don’t believe us. If I tell you about everyday things and you don’t believe me, how can I expect you to trust me when I share about God in Heaven? Believing in Jesus helps us understand how much God loves us and opens our eyes to the wonderful truths He has for us!"|In revising the translation of John 3:11-12, I need to ensure that I highlight the importance of belief and testimony while maintaining an accessible tone for a seven-year-old. I will focus on making the concepts clear and relatable without losing the depth of Jesus' message. Incorporating feedback on the need for a touch more formality, I will adjust the language accordingly, replacing overly casual phrases with ones that still resonate with young readers but respect the weight of scripture.|
|JHN 3:13|"No one can go up to Heaven except for Jesus, who came down from there to help us. We call Him the Son of Man, which means He knows all about Heaven. He shares the truth about God, and if we believe in Him, we learn how much God loves us. Jesus is the only Savior, and He is the way to God and Heaven."|To revise the translation of JHN 3:13, I will focus on making the text more concise while clearly emphasizing Jesus's unique role as the only Savior and the importance of believing in Him. I will ensure the language is simple and relatable for a seven-year-old, while maintaining the core Christian message. I will incorporate suggestions from my teachers about emphasizing Jesus's divinity and His exclusive role in connecting us to God.|
|JHN 3:14|Just like Moses held up a snake on a stick in the desert to help people get better when they were sick, Jesus will be lifted up on a cross to help us with our sins. When we look at Jesus and believe in Him, He can save us and help us be with God forever. Just like the people needed to look at the snake to feel better, we need to trust Jesus to help us. Trusting Jesus means believing that He died for our sins and rose again, so we can be forgiven. When we look to Him, He fills our hearts with hope and shows us how much God loves us!|To improve the translation of John 3:14 for a seven-year-old, I will incorporate all the teacher's corrections. This will involve clarifying the idea of 'sins' instead of using 'wrong things we do', adding a brief mention of repentance, and emphasizing the connection of Jesus being lifted up to His sacrifice and resurrection, ensuring it is simple and relatable for children.|
|JHN 3:15|Everyone who believes in Jesus, God's special Son, will not be lost but will have life forever with God. Just like the people looked at the snake to be healed, we need to believe in Jesus to be saved. Jesus loves us very much, and when we believe in Him, we can be with God forever! Believing in Jesus means we trust that He died for our wrong choices, and that brings us forgiveness and hope.|I will incorporate the teachers' corrections by making the message more concise and emphasizing belief in Jesus for forgiveness and eternal life. I will clarify the concepts without overwhelming young readers and use simple language throughout.|
|JHN 3:16|God loves everyone in the world so much that He gave us His one and only Son, Jesus, as a special gift. If you believe in Him, you will be forgiven for your mistakes and be able to be with God forever. Trusting in Jesus means you can have eternal life, which brings a happy feeling to your heart!|To effectively paraphrase John 3:16 for a seven-year-old, I will emphasize God's love and the gift of Jesus while ensuring the concept of grace and belief is clear. I will avoid complicated theological terms, and instead use simple language that resonates with children's emotions and understanding.|
|JHN 3:17|God didn’t send Jesus to say we’re bad or wrong. He sent Him because He loves everyone so much! Jesus came to save us from our mistakes, not to judge us. When we believe in Jesus, He helps us be close to God and gives us a happy life with Him forever.|I need to revise my translation of John 3:17 to ensure it is clear for a seven-year-old while also capturing the theological depth of the scripture. I will highlight the contrast between judgment and salvation as per the corrections while linking it directly to God's love, which is a significant aspect from the previous verse. It is important to maintain simple language and avoid complexity while ensuring all corrections are addressed in a coherent way.|
|JHN 3:18|If you believe in Jesus, God’s Son, you can be close to Him forever and feel His love! But if you don’t believe in Him, it’s like turning away from God, and that means you won’t get to enjoy His happiness. That’s really sad because God wants to be your friend and keep you safe with Him! Not believing in Jesus means you’re already choosing to miss out on all the good things He has for you.|I will revise the translation of John 3:18 to maintain the simple language appropriate for a seven-year-old while incorporating my teachers' suggestions. I need to highlight the importance of belief and clarify the concept of judgment for unbelief. The tone should remain positive and inviting, emphasizing God's love and desire for friendship. I will ensure this revised verse flows naturally from John 3:17, reinforcing the message of God's care and the seriousness of the choices people make regarding faith.|
|JHN 3:19|Here’s something really important: God sent Jesus to be the bright light that shows us the good things to do. Some people, though, choose to stay away from Jesus and prefer the dark. They like to do things that are wrong, and because of that, they miss out on the love and joy that God wants to give them. When they turn away from the light, it means they are not close to God, and that makes God sad because He wants to be their friend. We all have a choice: to follow Jesus, who is the light, so we can enjoy God’s love and happiness in our hearts.|I want to create a paraphrase that emphasizes the contrast between choosing Jesus (the light) and ignoring Him (the darkness). It needs to be clear, simple, and relatable for a seven-year-old. I’ll ensure it maintains the core message of God's desire for a relationship with us while including the concept of judgment subtly, without over-complicating the language.|
|JHN 3:20|Some people decide to do wrong things, which is called sin, and they stay away from Jesus because they don’t want their mistakes to be seen. But Jesus is like a bright light that shows us how much God loves us and helps us choose better. When we try to hide from the light, we miss the joy and love that God wants to give us. God wants us to come back to Him, tell Him we’re sorry for the bad things we’ve done, and let Him help us do what’s right. He loves us so much and is always ready to forgive us when we choose to follow Him.|In revising the translation for John 3:20, I need to ensure that the concepts of sin and the importance of light are made clear while keeping the language simple and relatable for a seven-year-old. I should emphasize the consequences of choosing darkness and highlight the love and forgiveness of God more directly, as well as referencing Jesus as central to the message.|
|JHN 3:21|When people are honest and choose to do what is right, they get closer to God. This shows everyone that the good things they do come from trusting God. God helps us do good things because He loves us, and we can show others His love through our actions.|In revising the translation for John 3:21, I want to ensure that it aligns with the core message of honesty and doing good while making it accessible to a seven-year-old. I will emphasize the relationship with God, incorporate the concept of 'truth,' and simplify language where necessary to ensure clarity. I will also connect it more directly to the previous verse's context about God's light and love.|
|JHN 3:22|After that, Jesus and His friends went to Judea. There, Jesus taught everyone how to love God and each other. He baptized people to show they wanted to say sorry for their wrong choices and to follow Him. This baptism was important because it showed everyone they believed in Jesus and wanted to follow God's teachings. Jesus asked us to be baptized to show our faith and obey Him.|I need to focus on making the language simpler and more direct while ensuring that the key concepts of repentance, faith, and the significance of baptism are clearly communicated. It's important to clarify what baptism represents and the idea of saying sorry for wrong choices without losing the core message of Jesus' teachings.|
|JHN 3:23|At the same time, John the Baptist was in a place called Aenon, close to Salim, where there was a lot of water. Many people came to John to be baptized because they wanted to say they were sorry for their sins and show they wanted to be close to God. This baptism was special because it showed they believed in Jesus and wanted to follow God's ways. John helped them promise to be part of God’s family and to be ready for what Jesus was teaching. Being baptized was something God asked us to do to show we love Him.|To improve the translation of John 3:23, I will focus on simplifying the language further to make it relatable to a seven-year-old while ensuring that the theological concepts are accurately conveyed. I will incorporate direct references to the act of baptism, the importance of John the Baptist's role, and ensure the term 'sins' is used appropriately to align with Christian doctrine. This will maintain clarity and keep the message aligned with the context established in John 3:22.|
|JHN 3:24|John the Baptist was in a place called Aenon, near Salim, where there was a lot of water. He was teaching people about God and helping them prepare to follow Jesus. Many people came to him because they felt sorry for the wrong things they had done and wanted to ask God for forgiveness. When they were baptized in the water, it was a special way to show they wanted to follow God and start over. John was the one who baptized them and explained how to live in God’s way. John had not been put in prison yet.|I will incorporate the feedback from my teachers, making sure to emphasize the concepts of baptism and repentance clearly for a seven-year-old audience. I will adjust the phrasing to make the meaning more direct and accessible while retaining the key theological points. I also need to clarify that John was performing the baptisms and simplify phrases that may be too abstract for children. I will maintain the context from the previous verse to ensure a smooth flow between the verses.|
|JHN 3:25|One day, John the Baptist's friends, called disciples, were talking with a teacher from the Jewish people. They were asking him questions about how people can be made clean inside and what it means to make God happy. They learned that baptism is a special way to show we are sorry for our wrong choices and want to follow Jesus. John the Baptist explained that when we get baptized, it is like washing away our bad things and saying we want to obey God and believe in Him.|I will revise the translation to clarify the ideas of spiritual cleanliness, emphasize John's role as a prophet, and simplify language for a seven-year-old. Additionally, I will provide context about the Jewish teacher and the significance of baptism in a more straightforward way.|
|JHN 3:26|Some of John's friends came to him and said, "Teacher, remember Jesus, the man you talked about? He's baptizing people now, and everyone is going to Him! They want to learn about God and follow Him, just like you told them to. It's so amazing! What do you think about all these people choosing to go to Him instead of us?"|To improve the translation of John 3:26, I will incorporate the key elements mentioned in the teachers' corrections. I will emphasize the significance of John's role, the importance of Jesus as the Son of God, and the joy of following Him, while ensuring the language remains accessible for a seven-year-old. This involves simplifying complex ideas into relatable terms while capturing the essence of the message.|
|JHN 3:27|John replied, "No one can have anything good unless God gives it to them from heaven. It's like when you have a birthday party: you can only get presents if someone chooses to give them to you. Just like that, all the good things we have come from God, and those things help us learn more about Him and love Him even more!"|To revise the translation of John 3:27, I will focus on incorporating the feedback from my teachers while keeping the message clear and accessible for a seven-year-old. I will maintain the birthday party analogy but adjust it to better reflect the spiritual gifts concept, ensuring that it ties back to God's provision. I will also simplify the phrasing about receiving from heaven to enhance clarity, and ensure that the essence of the original scripture remains intact.|
|JHN 3:28|John the Baptist said, 'Don't forget, I told you I am not the important person you are waiting for. I’m like a friend who helps others get ready for a big event, and that big event is Jesus coming to save us. God sent me to share this good news with you and show you just how amazing Jesus is, because He is the one who can rescue everyone!"|To improve the paraphrase, I will focus on emphasizing John the Baptist's humility more clearly, explicitly state that he is not the Christ, and ensure the language remains simple and engaging for a seven-year-old. I will keep the relatable analogies to aid comprehension and reinforce the role of Jesus as our Savior.|
|JHN 3:29|John said, 'Jesus is the groom who loves his bride, and I am like his friend who helps him get ready for the big day. When I hear the groom's voice, it makes me really happy! My heart is full of joy because I get to tell everyone how special Jesus is. He is the Savior we've all been waiting for!"|To effectively revise the translation of JHN 3:29 for a seven-year-old audience, I will maintain the key metaphors of 'groom' and 'bride,' while simplifying the language to ensure clarity.

This will enhance understanding while respecting the biblical narrative.|
|JHN 3:30|"Jesus is the one who should be number one in everyone's hearts! I want everyone to notice Him more and more. When Jesus is shining bright, it makes me super happy! I know that I have to step back so He can be in the front, and that feels amazing! I really want everyone to know how wonderful Jesus is!"|I need to simplify the language while emphasizing both the increase of Jesus' importance and the decrease of myself, making sure it resonates with a seven-year-old's understanding. I will avoid phrases that could confuse young readers and focus on joy in Jesus' greatness.|
|JHN 3:31|Jesus is the greatest because He came from heaven! People on earth can only share what they see, but Jesus knows all about God because He is from above. He has a special way of understanding everything clearly! He shows us God's love with His actions and teaches us important lessons. That’s why we should pay attention to Him and believe in His words.|To create a paraphrase of John 3:31 that resonates with a seven-year-old, I'll maintain clarity about Jesus's divine origin and knowledge, ensuring it is respectful and accurate. I will focus on enhancing the contrast between earthly and heavenly understanding while incorporating child-friendly language that encourages belief in Jesus.|
|JHN 3:32|Jesus tells us everything He has seen and heard from God. His words are very special because they show us the truth. We need to believe in Him because He knows what God wants us to learn. But some people don’t listen to Him or believe His words, and that means they miss out on understanding God's love and the wonderful truth He shares with us.|I need to revise the translation of John 3:32 to emphasize Jesus as a witness to God's truth and make the concepts of belief and receiving His message clearer for a seven-year-old.

The updated version will maintain the simplicity and clarity suitable for young children while reflecting the original text's intent.|
|JHN 3:33|When someone believes what Jesus says, they show that they really trust God. Jesus tells us the truth about God, and He wants us to understand that God is always true and real.

|JHN 3:34|God sent Jesus to tell us everything about His love and His wonderful plan. Jesus shares God's words because He is filled with the Holy Spirit, which helps Him speak the truth.

Jesus helps us understand God's heart and teaches us how to live in a way that makes God happy. We can fully trust Jesus because He knows what God wants for us and shows us how much God cares.|To revise the translation for JHN 3:35, I will focus on conveying the key ideas of God's love for Jesus and the authority given to Him in a way that is simple and engaging for a seven-year-old. I need to avoid overly informal language and ensure clarity about Jesus' unique role and relationship with God, as well as maintain a tone of reverence.|
|JHN 3:36|If you believe in Jesus, you get to live forever with God, which is so wonderful! But if you don’t believe in Him, you miss out on that happy life with God. God really wants us to choose Him and be with Him because He loves us so much, and He wants everyone to be joyful together.|The translation should focus on simplifying the language while maintaining the essence of the scripture. I will ensure that it conveys the importance of belief in Jesus for eternal life and God's love without instilling fear. The tone will be friendly and positive, suitable for a young audience, while keeping it concise and clear.|
