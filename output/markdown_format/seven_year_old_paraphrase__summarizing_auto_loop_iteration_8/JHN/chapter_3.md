|JHN 3:1|One day, there was a man named Nicodemus. He was a Pharisee, which means he was a teacher and leader who followed God's laws closely. The Pharisees were important because they helped people understand how to live according to God's rules. Nicodemus wanted to learn more about God and believed that Jesus could teach him, so he decided to go visit Jesus.|To enhance the understanding of JHN 3:1 for a seven-year-old, I will simplify the language used to describe Nicodemus and the Pharisees, while maintaining the important context of their religious roles. I will reduce any redundancy and make it clear why Nicodemus sought out Jesus, emphasizing his desire to learn about God. This will help young readers connect with the narrative and understand the significance of the encounter.|
|JHN 3:2|One night, Nicodemus came to see Jesus. He said, 'Teacher, we know you are special because you do amazing things that only God can help you do.'|To create a paraphrase of JHN 3:2 for a seven-year-old, I will remove redundancy regarding Nicodemus's background as a Pharisee, as this has already been established. I will simplify the language used to describe Jesus's miracles while retaining Nicodemus's respect by keeping the term 'teacher.' I will briefly clarify that he approached Jesus at night to show his desire to learn without being overly repetitive. This way, the translation remains clear, accessible, and aligned with a conservative Christian understanding of Jesus's authority.|
|JHN 3:3|Jesus answered, "Listen closely! You must believe in me and let God help you change your heart. If you don’t, you can’t see where God is in charge, which is a special place full of His love!"|To revise JHN 3:3 effectively for a seven-year-old audience, I will minimize redundancy by removing any phrases that have already been mentioned in earlier verses. I'll simplify the language, focusing on making the idea of personal choice clear while explaining the transformation that happens when one believes in Jesus. I'll define 'God's kingdom' in a straightforward way that conveys its meaning without using complex terminology. Overall, the goal is to ensure clarity and engagement while retaining the theological significance of the original message.|
|JHN 3:4-5|Nicodemus was puzzled and said, "How can an old person start fresh? Can someone really go back inside their mom to be born again?" Jesus answered, "Listen carefully! To be a part of God’s family, you need to be born from water, which is baptism, and also from God’s Spirit. When you believe in me and get baptized, God changes your heart and makes you new inside!"|To effectively translate JHN 3:4-5 for a seven-year-old audience, it is important to simplify the concepts while ensuring the theological significance is preserved. The translation should avoid redundancy about being 'born again,' clarify the meaning of being 'made new' through baptism, and maintain a tone that aligns with conservative Christian teachings. I'll focus on the transformative nature of faith and baptism, ensuring clarity and relevance for young readers.|
|JHN 3:6|"When a baby is born, they come from their mom. But when you believe in Jesus and get baptized, God gives you His Spirit. This means you become part of God's family!"|To create an engaging and understandable paraphrase of JHN 3:6 for a seven-year-old, I will focus on making the language clear and direct. I will remove any repetitive elements already explained in earlier verses about being born again. Instead, I will emphasize the distinction between physical birth and the spiritual transformation that occurs through belief in Jesus and baptism. I aim to keep the explanation simple yet impactful to ensure young readers grasp the important theological concept of becoming part of God's family through faith and God's Spirit. This will involve refining language to avoid vague terms and providing a concise explanation that ties belief in Jesus directly to spiritual rebirth.|
|JHN 3:7|"Don't be surprised that I said you need to be born again. This means you need to trust in Jesus and let God's Spirit help you become part of His family!"|To revise JHN 3:7 for clarity and comprehension at a seven-year-old level, I will remove redundant phrases that were mentioned in previous verses to streamline the message. I'll focus on simplifying the language, specifically by replacing complex phrases with more straightforward alternatives. Additionally, I will highlight the importance of being 'born again' and how it relates to faith in Jesus and the work of the Holy Spirit, ensuring the explanation is both clear and impactful for young readers.|
|JHN 3:8|"You know how the wind blows wherever it wants, and we can feel it and hear it, but we can’t see where it comes from or where it goes. Just like that, when someone believes in Jesus, God's Spirit changes them inside. You can see the good things they do because of this change, showing that they are part of God's family!"|For JHN 3:8, I will simplify the language and make it easier for a seven-year-old to understand. I will avoid repeating information from the previous verses about being born of the Spirit and the transformations that happen in a believer's life. Instead, I will focus on the idea that the Holy Spirit is responsible for making changes in us and that those changes are visible as good things we do. I will clarify that these changes show we are part of God's family, while also emphasizing that believing in Jesus is the most important part of being saved, rather than our actions. This will ensure the teaching about salvation by faith alone is clear and direct.|
|JHN 3:9|Nicodemus was confused and asked Jesus, "How can a person really start over? I don’t understand how this can happen!"|To address the peer review suggestions for JHN 3:9, I will focus on removing redundant phrases about being 'made new inside' to enhance clarity and maintain the serious tone of Nicodemus's inquiry. I will ensure that the revised translation emphasizes the significance of his confusion regarding spiritual rebirth while still making it understandable for a seven-year-old. I'll also look to better connect Nicodemus's question with the surrounding context of spiritual renewal mentioned in earlier verses.|
|JHN 3:10|Jesus said to Nicodemus, 'You teach others about God, so it's surprising that you don't understand how special God's love is! These ideas are really important because they help everyone know how they can be close to God. Understanding this helps you teach others about how much God cares for all of us.'|In revising the translation for JHN 3:10, I will focus on reducing redundancy by eliminating repetitive phrases regarding God's family since these ideas are already presented in earlier verses. I will also work on making the concept of Nicodemus's surprise clearer by explaining why it's unexpected for someone with his background not to understand these important teachings about God. Additionally, I will provide a simple context for 'important lessons' without overwhelming a seven-year-old audience, ensuring the message is engaging and easy to understand. The overall tone will remain supportive and friendly, emphasizing God's love and teachings.|
|JHN 3:11-12|"I want you to know something very important! We talk about what we know about God, but many people don’t believe what we say. If you find it hard to trust what I say about everyday things, how can you believe the amazing things I tell you about Heaven? You need to believe in me to understand how much God loves you and wants to help you!"|In revising JHN 3:11-12 for a seven-year-old audience, I will focus on removing any repetitive content that has been established earlier, while ensuring that the main message about the importance of believing in Jesus is clear and compelling. I will also highlight Jesus' authority and the serious consequences of not believing in Him in a simple, engaging manner. The aim is to make these verses easy to understand while conveying the essential Christian belief in salvation through faith in Jesus.|
|JHN 3:13|"No one can go to Heaven by themselves. Only Jesus can show us how to be close to God. When you believe in Him, you are welcomed into God's loving family forever!"|To revise JHN 3:13, I will streamline the translation to eliminate redundancy and enhance clarity regarding Jesus' unique role in our relationship with God. I will ensure that young readers clearly understand the importance of believing in Jesus and how this belief brings them closer to God's love. I will also avoid adding too much extra information, keeping the language simple and focused for a seven-year-old's comprehension level.|
|JHN 3:14|"Just like Moses lifted a snake on a stick in the desert to help the people who were sick, Jesus will be lifted up on the cross to help us. If you look at Jesus and believe in Him, you will be saved and get to live with God forever!"|To address the peer review of John 3:14, I will focus on three main corrections. First, I will remove any redundancies in the message to make it clearer and less repetitive. Second, I will simplify the phrase 'lifted up' so it can be understood more easily by a seven-year-old. Lastly, I will make sure to emphasize the importance of believing in Jesus for salvation, as this aligns with conservative Christian teachings. The goal is to create a paraphrase that maintains the essence of the verse while making it more accessible and clear for young children.|

Believing in Jesus means trusting Him to be your friend and helper, just like having a superhero who always cares for you!"|To create a clearer and more precise translation of JHN 3:16 for a seven-year-old audience, I will focus on simplifying the language while ensuring that key theological concepts are communicated effectively. I will remove any repetitive phrases about being lost and part of God's family since these are discussed earlier in the context. I will clarify what it means to believe in Jesus, emphasizing it as the only way to receive eternal life with God. Examples that resonate with a child's understanding will be included to make the message more relatable without complicating it.|
|JHN 3:17|"God didn’t send His Son, Jesus, to judge us. He sent Him to save us and help everyone who believes in Him become part of God's loving family!"|For the updated translation of JHN 3:17, I will maintain a serious yet accessible tone suitable for children. I will avoid overly casual language while ensuring clarity for key terms. I'll minimize overlap with JHN 3:16 to prevent redundancy and ensure the verse stands alone in conveying its message. The focus will be on making it easy for a seven-year-old to understand that God sent Jesus to help us, not to criticize us.|
|JHN 3:18|"If you believe in Jesus, you are safe in God's family and filled with His love. But if you don’t believe in Him, you miss out on all the wonderful love God wants to give you. God really wants everyone to feel close to Him and be happy!"|To revise JHN 3:18 for a seven-year-old audience while addressing the corrections, I will focus on simplifying the language and reducing redundancy. The key message is that believing in Jesus brings safety and love from God, while not believing means missing out on that love. I will replace terms like 'judged' with 'not in trouble' and emphasize God's love without being repetitive. The goal is to convey a clear and comforting message about faith and its consequences.|
|JHN 3:19|"Here’s what happens: God sent Jesus, who is like a bright light, into the world. Some people choose to stay away from Him because they feel bad about the wrong things they do. They don't want others to see their mistakes. But God loves us so much and wants us to come to Jesus, the light, so we can be happy and do good things together!"|To address the corrections provided, I will focus on clarifying that the light mentioned in this verse refers to Jesus, as well as explaining why some people choose to stay in darkness. I'll ensure the language is simple and avoids redundancy. This will involve emphasizing the love of God and the importance of Jesus for moral guidance, all while ensuring that the message is comprehensible to a seven-year-old.|
|JHN 3:20|"People who do wrong actions often stay away from Jesus because they feel ashamed and guilty about what they have done. They think if they hide, no one will see their sins. But Jesus loves everyone so much and wants to help us turn away from our wrong actions. He invites us to come to Him, so we can be forgiven and feel happy again!"|To create an effective translation for JHN 3:20 that meets the given correction guidelines, I will ensure the message is clear and direct for a seven-year-old audience. I will reduce redundancy with JHN 3:19 by ensuring each verse has its own unique focus. I will use terms like 'sin' or 'wrong actions' instead of vague phrases, enhancing clarity. I will also strengthen the connection to the theme of light and darkness by clearly explaining why some people avoid the light (due to shame or guilt). Finally, I will emphasize the hope and redemption offered through Jesus, balancing any discussion of sin with His loving invitation to be forgiven and to experience joy.|
|JHN 3:21|"When people choose to do what is right, it shows that they trust God. They are happy to let others see how God helps them live good lives and share His love with everyone!"|I will revise JHN 3:21 to make it simpler and clearer for a seven-year-old. The new translation will focus on God's role in helping us to do what is right and will connect the act of doing right with trusting in God's guidance. I will avoid using metaphors that may confuse young readers and will instead explain directly how trusting in God leads to good actions. Additionally, I will ensure that the message highlights the joy of living according to God's love.|
|JHN 3:22|"After that, Jesus and His friends went to a place called Judea. They spent time with the people there and helped them understand God's love. They baptized many of them because baptism is a special way to show that we are sorry for our wrong choices and want to follow Jesus. It helps us grow closer to God and shows how much Jesus cares for everyone!"|In reviewing JHN 3:22, the focus will be on maintaining clarity for a seven-year-old while reducing redundancy related to baptism.

|JHN 3:23|"At that time, John the Baptist was in a place with lots of water, and he was baptizing people. Baptism is a special way to show we are sorry for our wrong choices and want to follow Jesus.

To reduce redundancy, I will focus solely on the essence of John baptizing without reiterating previously stated concepts. I will also emphasize John's mission in preparing people to follow Jesus and the significance of baptism as an expression of wanting to be close to God. Additionally, I'll keep the language accessible and straightforward to enhance understanding.|
|JHN 3:24|"At that time, John the Baptist was still telling people about God’s love and helping them get ready to meet Jesus. He wanted everyone to know how special Jesus is and how much He can help us feel close to God!"|In revising JHN 3:24, I will focus on simplifying the language while maintaining the core message about John the Baptist's role in preparing people for Jesus. The comment highlights the need to remove unnecessary details about John's imprisonment that do not aid in understanding his significance. Therefore, I will create a more direct statement that illustrates John's mission in connection to Jesus's message and purpose, while still ensuring it remains accessible to a seven-year-old.|
|JHN 3:25|"Some of John’s friends asked a Jewish man, ‘How can we be close to God and feel clean inside?’ They wanted to know how saying sorry for our mistakes and getting baptized helps us be part of God’s loving family.
