|JHN 3:1|One day, there was a man named Nicodemus. He was a Pharisee, which means he helped people learn about God and His rules. Pharisees were important leaders in the community. Nicodemus wanted to understand more about God, so he decided to visit Jesus, hoping to learn from Him.|The goal is to introduce Nicodemus in a way that is simple and clear for a seven-year-old. I will highlight that he was a Pharisee, emphasizing their role in helping others understand God's rules. I'll also clarify that Nicodemus approached Jesus to learn more about God, which helps young readers see why he is important in the story.

|JHN 3:2|One night, Nicodemus came to see Jesus. He said, 'Teacher, we know you do amazing things that only God can help you do. You must be from God!'|In revising JHN 3:2, I need to streamline the content to avoid redundancy while maintaining clarity for a young audience. I will remove repeated references to Nicodemus being a Pharisee, since this information has already been established in the previous verse. I want to keep the language simple, focusing on Jesus's miraculous works, which underline His divine nature. I will also maintain the respectful acknowledgment of Jesus as 'Teacher' while keeping the context of Nicodemus visiting at night minimal but clear. Overall, the goal is to ensure the translation is accessible and emphasizes the important themes of respect, acknowledgment of miracles, and understanding Jesus's authority.|
|JHN 3:3|"Listen closely! You must trust in me and let God make you new inside. If you don’t believe, you won’t see the beautiful place where God loves and cares for everyone!"|To effectively paraphrase John 3:3 for a seven-year-old, I need to avoid redundancy by not repeating information already mentioned in the surrounding verses. Instead, I will focus on simplifying the key message about belief in Jesus and being 'born again' through the work of God's Spirit. I'll make sure to clarify what it means to be part of 'God's kingdom' and use engaging, age-appropriate language that resonates with young readers. The aim is to clearly convey that believing in Jesus is essential for experiencing God's love and being part of His family.|
|JHN 3:4-5|Nicodemus was confused and asked, "How can an old person be born again? Can someone go back into their mom to be born a second time?" Jesus replied, "Listen closely! To be part of God's family, you must be born through water, which means baptism, and also by God's Spirit. When you believe in me and are baptized, God changes your heart and makes you new inside! This is very special because it means you are loved by God and become part of His family forever!"|To improve the translation of JHN 3:4-5, I will reduce redundancy, clarify language, and emphasize the theological significance of baptism and faith in Jesus. This involves rephrasing the questions from Nicodemus and the response from Jesus to enhance clarity and make the concepts of spiritual rebirth and baptism accessible for a seven-year-old, while ensuring it reflects conservative Christian teachings. I will maintain a tone that is engaging and understandable for children, emphasizing the transformative nature of believing in Jesus and the role of baptism in becoming part of God's family.|

This means emphasizing the importance of being 'born again' in a way that resonates with young readers, keeping in mind the context provided in the surrounding verses.|
|JHN 3:8|"The wind blows wherever it wants. We can feel it and hear it, but we can't see where it comes from or where it's going. Just like that, when someone believes in Jesus, God's Spirit changes their heart. You can see the good things they do because of this change, which shows they are part of God's family!"|In revising JHN 3:8, I will simplify the language and concepts to ensure a seven-year-old can easily understand them. I will focus on explaining the work of the Holy Spirit in a clear way, linking it to the transformation in a believer's life.

I will frame his inquiry in a way that acknowledges his perplexity without using overly casual language, thereby preserving the depth of the moment.|
|JHN 3:10|Jesus replied, 'You teach others about God, so it’s surprising that you don’t understand this! Knowing about God’s love and how to be close to Him is very important, and it helps you teach others, too! Everyone needs to know how much God cares for them.'|In addressing the feedback, I will first eliminate any redundant phrases that reiterate concepts already present in surrounding verses, specifically focusing on what Nicodemus should know as a teacher. Next, I will clarify why it's surprising for someone knowledgeable like Nicodemus to not understand these foundational ideas about God's love. Lastly, I will contextualize the significance of these lessons for a child’s understanding, making sure it remains engaging and clear.|
|JHN 3:11-12|"I want you to know something really important! We share what we understand about God, but not everyone believes us.

|JHN 3:19|"Here’s what happens: God sent Jesus to be our light, but some people like to stay away from Him. They feel ashamed because of the wrong things they do, so they hide from the light. But Jesus loves everyone and wants us to come to Him. He helps us know what is right and feel happy!"|For JHN 3:19, I need to simplify the language while ensuring clarity regarding the contrast between light (Jesus) and darkness (wrong actions). The new translation should avoid repeating concepts already mentioned, making it easier for a seven-year-old to grasp the message. I'll focus on how Jesus represents God's love and guidance, and mention why some people choose darkness—because of shame from their wrongdoings—without being redundant.|
|JHN 3:20|"People who do bad things often stay away from Jesus because they feel ashamed of their sins. They think if they hide, no one will notice what they’ve done wrong.

|JHN 3:22|"After that, Jesus and His friends went to a place called Judea. There, they spent time with the people, sharing God’s love. Jesus baptized many of them, showing that they wanted to follow Him and turn away from their wrong choices. This special act of baptism helped them feel closer to God and understand how much Jesus loves each one of us!"|To create a more effective translation of JHN 3:22 that caters to the comprehension level of a seven-year-old, I will focus on streamlining the explanation of baptism while emphasizing Jesus' authority and significance. I will remove redundancy by referencing earlier verses where baptism is mentioned but add clarity about its importance and connection to repentance. This will ensure that the young audience understands not just what is happening, but why it is important, maintaining a simple yet theologically sound explanation.|
|JHN 3:23|"At that time, John the Baptist was in a place with a lot of water.

John wanted everyone to believe in Jesus because He loves us and helps us get closer to God!"|To address the feedback for JHN 3:23, I will reduce redundancy by focusing less on the fact that John was baptizing people, as this has already been mentioned in previous verses.

I'll emphasize John's role as a humble messenger while highlighting God's sovereignty in granting gifts.

This will help reinforce the idea that everything good comes from God, and John's joy comes from helping others know Jesus better.|
|JHN 3:28|"Remember, I am not the special Savior, Jesus. I am just a friend who tells you about Him. My job is to help you know how much Jesus loves us and how important He is!"|To refine JHN 3:28 for clarity and simplicity, I will focus on minimizing repetitive phrases regarding John's role and emphasizing his humble position as a messenger rather than a savior. I aim to maintain a balance between explaining John's importance and ensuring the language is straightforward enough for a seven-year-old. The translation should convey the idea that John's mission is to point others to Jesus without overly repeating concepts already covered in previous verses.
