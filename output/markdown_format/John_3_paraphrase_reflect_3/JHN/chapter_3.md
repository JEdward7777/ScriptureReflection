|JHN 3:1|One night, a man named Nicodemus, who was a teacher about God and a leader of the Jewish people, came to see Jesus.|I need to ensure that the updated translation keeps the core details about Nicodemus, including his identity as a Pharisee and his leadership role, while making the language and sentences simpler for a seven-year-old. I will also make sure to clarify that his visit to Jesus took place at night, as this detail is significant.|
|JHN 3:2|One night, a Jewish leader and teacher named Nicodemus came to talk to Jesus. He said, 'Teacher, we know you are special and sent from God. Only God could help someone do the miracles you do.'|In revising the translation for John 3:2, I want to incorporate all the feedback while keeping it accessible for a seven-year-old. I will emphasize Nicodemus's role as a Jewish leader and teacher more clearly, maintain the nighttime setting for context, and replace 'wonderful things' with 'miracles' to enhance clarity without losing the essence of the original message.|
|JHN 3:3|Jesus replied, "Listen up! If someone doesn't have a new start and be like a child in their heart, they can't see God's special place, which is His Kingdom."|To create a translation of John 3:3 that is appropriate for a seven-year-old, I'll ensure to maintain simplicity while emphasizing the importance of being 'born again' and spiritual rebirth. I'll use child-friendly phrases and provide clarity on the concept of God's Kingdom without over-simplifying theological terms. I'll also incorporate feedback on phrasing, particularly avoiding terms like 'little baby' in favor of 'like a child'.|
|JHN 3:4-5|Nicodemus asked Jesus, "How can an old person start over and be born again? Can they go back into their mom’s tummy to be born again?" Jesus answered, "Listen closely! No one can enter God’s Kingdom unless they are given a new life through water and the Spirit. This means we need God’s help to have a fresh start in our hearts."|I will focus on making the translation clearer and more accessible for a seven-year-old. I'll emphasize the connection between water and the Spirit while ensuring that the question from Nicodemus is presented in a respectful manner. I'll also clarify the meaning of the terms 'water' and 'Spirit' for better understanding. Additionally, I'll ensure that the reference to God's Kingdom is clearly linked to the overall message.|
|JHN 3:6|Just like a baby is born from their mom, people need to be born from the Spirit of God to have a new start. This means they get God's love in their hearts and become part of His family. When that happens, they can live a happy and kind life that comes from being close to God.|To enhance clarity and theological accuracy, I will include an explanation of what it means to be 'born of God's Spirit' while retaining child-friendly language. This will help ensure that the young audience understands both the concept of spiritual rebirth and God's active role in that transformation.|
|JHN 3:7|So, don’t be surprised when I say that everyone needs to be born again to join God’s family and live happily with Him.|To revise the translation of JHN 3:7, I'll emphasize the need for spiritual rebirth while keeping the language simple and relatable for a seven-year-old.

|JHN 3:8|The wind goes wherever it wants, and we can hear it, but we don’t know where it comes from or where it’s going. This is how it is with God’s Spirit. When someone believes in Jesus and is born again, God’s Spirit brings a special change inside them. It helps them feel different and live for God, even though we can’t see it happening on the outside.|I will revise the translation of John 3:8 to make it suitable for a seven-year-old while incorporating the feedback from my teachers. The revised translation will clarify the connection between the Holy Spirit, the experience of being 'born again,' and faith in Jesus, all while maintaining the analogy of the wind. I will ensure the language is simple and direct, enhancing theological clarity without overwhelming complexity.|
|JHN 3:9|Nicodemus was a teacher and very puzzled. He asked, "How can someone start fresh and be born again? I really don’t understand what that means! Can you help me?" Jesus was telling him that being born again is a wonderful gift from God. It means that God’s Spirit helps us change and be better inside, just like the wind we can't see, but can feel. It's a special way to live for God!|I will revise the translation of JHN 3:9 to ensure it captures Nicodemus's confusion clearly and simply, while also reinforcing the concept of spiritual rebirth in a way that a seven-year-old can understand.

I will also briefly explain who Nicodemus is to provide context.|

Use specific terms like 'important things' instead of vague phrases to aid comprehension for a seven-year-old. Aim for a tone that reflects Jesus' authority while still being accessible and relatable to young readers.|
|JHN 3:11-12|"I’m telling you the truth! We are sharing what we know and what we have seen about God, but you don’t believe us. If I tell you about things on Earth and you don’t believe me, how can you trust me when I talk about God’s home?"|To create an updated translation, I will maintain the simplicity and clarity suitable for a seven-year-old.

I will incorporate feedback regarding language relatability and make slight adjustments to enhance clarity without losing the meaning of the original text.|

I'll ensure the translation flows logically from the previous verses, emphasizing why Jesus is discussing Heaven and His unique authority.|
|JHN 3:14|Just like Moses lifted a snake up on a pole in the desert so the people could see it and get better, Jesus will also be lifted up for everyone to see.

Just as the people had to look at the snake and believe it could help them, we need to believe in Jesus to be helped and saved, too.|I need to revise the paraphrase of John 3:14 to ensure it is understandable for a seven-year-old. I'll incorporate the feedback from my teachers about providing a clearer explanation of the significance of Moses lifting the snake and emphasizing faith in Jesus for salvation. I will aim for smooth transitions and make the connection to the story relatable to children.|
|JHN 3:15|So, everyone who trusts in Jesus will not be lost, but instead, they will be given the amazing gift of living happily forever with God.

|JHN 3:18|If you believe in God’s Son, you will have eternal life and be close to Him forever. But if you don’t believe, you are choosing to be away from God and His love, which means you won’t be with Him forever.|I need to ensure that the revised translation maintains clarity and depth appropriate for a seven-year-old, while also incorporating the theological implications of belief and unbelief.

It's important to ensure the language is straightforward yet meaningful.|
|JHN 3:19|This is how it is: God sent Jesus to be the light and show us the right way. But some people liked their sins more than the light because they didn’t want to change. They chose to stay in darkness instead of coming close to God and His love.|I need to revise the current translation of JHN 3:19 to incorporate feedback from my teachers. They suggest using the term 'sin' instead of 'wrong actions' and directly referring to 'light' rather than 'goodness'. I should also ensure that the message emphasizes God's love and the choice between light and darkness, keeping it simple for a seven-year-old.|
|JHN 3:20|Some people do bad things and don’t want anyone to know, so they stay away from God’s loving light. But God’s light shows us the good and helps us make better choices. He really wants us to come closer to Him and find happiness by doing what is right.|To enhance the understanding of God's light and love for a seven-year-old, I will rephrase the translation to highlight the positive aspects of coming closer to God while addressing the idea that some people choose to hide from Him.

|JHN 3:22|After that, Jesus and His helpers went to Judea, where they taught the people about God’s love and how to be kind. They baptized people in water, which showed that these people wanted to follow Jesus and believe in Him.

|JHN 3:26|Some of John's friends came to him and said, "Teacher, do you remember that man named Jesus who was with you on the other side of the river?
