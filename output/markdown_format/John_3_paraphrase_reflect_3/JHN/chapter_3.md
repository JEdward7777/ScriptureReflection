|JHN 3:1|One night, a man named Nicodemus came to visit Jesus. He was a Pharisee, which means he was a teacher about God and a leader in the Jewish community. Nicodemus wanted to ask Jesus some questions and understand His teachings better.|To create a paraphrase suitable for a seven-year-old, I will incorporate all the corrections suggested by the teachers. I need to simplify the phrases while including relevant details like Nicodemus being a Pharisee and his purpose for visiting Jesus at night. The goal is to maintain clarity and ensure comprehension for a young audience.|
|JHN 3:2|One night, a Jewish leader named Nicodemus came to talk to Jesus because he wanted to understand Him better. He said, 'Teacher, we know you are someone special who has come from God.

I'll explain why Nicodemus came at night and clarify who Jesus is, keeping the language simple and age-appropriate.|
|JHN 3:3|Jesus replied, "Listen closely! Unless someone is born again, they cannot see the wonderful world where God is King."|Incorporating the corrections and focusing on clarity and understanding for a seven-year-old, I will refine the translation to maintain theological accuracy while ensuring the language is simple and engaging. It's important to provide a clear understanding of what it means to be 'born again' and what 'God's Kingdom' is in terms that a child can relate to.|
|JHN 3:4-5|Nicodemus asked Jesus, "How can someone be born again when they are already old? Can they enter their mom's tummy again to be born?" Jesus replied, "Listen carefully! No one can enter God's Kingdom unless they are born of water, like when we are baptized, and born of the Spirit, which means God gives us a new heart and life. We must let Jesus be our Savior to be born again!"|To address the feedback from my teachers, I will clarify the concepts of 'water' and 'the Spirit' by mentioning water baptism and the role of the Holy Spirit. I will ensure to emphasize the idea of being 'born again' and connect it more explicitly to accepting Jesus as Savior. This will help maintain the theological integrity of the passage while ensuring it remains accessible for a seven-year-old. Additionally, I will use clear and simple language throughout the translation.|
|JHN 3:6|When a person is born as a baby, they come from their mom. But when someone is born from God's Spirit, they receive a special gift from God that changes them inside. It's like getting a new heart full of love and courage to live in God's family, starting a fresh and happy life with His help.|To create an updated translation of JHN 3:6 that is suitable for a seven-year-old, I will maintain the key themes of spiritual rebirth and the significance of being born of the Spirit. I'll clarify the idea of spiritual transformation, highlighting the role of God's Spirit in giving new strength and guidance. I'll ensure that the language is simple and relatable, connecting it to the concepts introduced in the previous verses about family and new life.|
|JHN 3:7|So, don't be surprised when I say that everyone needs to be 'born again' to join God's family and feel His love in their hearts.

The goal is to capture the core idea while being clear and simple, enhancing understanding without losing theological accuracy.|
|JHN 3:8|The wind blows wherever it wants, and you can hear it, but you don’t see where it comes from or where it goes. It’s just like the Holy Spirit!

You might not see it happen, but it helps you follow God and be part of His family, which is really special.|To improve the translation of JHN 3:8, I'll emphasize the necessity of being 'born again' in relation to the work of the Spirit. I need to simplify the language further while maintaining the analogy of the wind to help young readers understand the invisible nature of the Spirit's work. Additionally, I'll clarify what it means to be 'born again' to strengthen the connection to JHN 3:7.|
|JHN 3:9|Nicodemus was really confused and said, "How can someone be born again? What does that mean? I don’t understand how it works! When we believe in Jesus, God’s Spirit makes us new inside, so we can follow Him and be part of His family."|I need to ensure that the new translation of JHN 3:9 maintains the context provided in JHN 3:8.

Additionally, I should clarify what it means to be 'born again' without making it overly complex for a seven-year-old.|

It’s surprising that you don’t understand them!'|To revise JHN 3:10 for a seven-year-old audience, I need to clarify the significance of Nicodemus as a teacher and the importance of understanding spiritual truths.

|JHN 3:11-12|"I really want you to listen! We talk about what we know and what we’ve learned from God, but you don’t believe us. If I tell you about things that happen here on Earth and you don’t trust me, how will you believe when I talk about things from God’s special home in heaven? Believing is very important!"|I need to create a translation that simplifies the message of JHN 3:11-12 while incorporating feedback from my teachers. The focus should be on clarity, engagement, and the importance of belief in both earthly and heavenly matters. I'll ensure that the revised translation is age-appropriate for a seven-year-old and relates well to the preceding verse, JHN 3:10, while maintaining the essence of the original message.|
|JHN 3:13|No one has ever gone to Heaven, except for Jesus. He is the Son of Man who came down from Heaven. Jesus knows everything about Heaven because He is the only one who has been there.

I should ensure that the new phrasing aligns with the corrections given, especially emphasizing Jesus' authority and the significance of His knowledge of Heaven.|
|JHN 3:14|Just like Moses lifted a snake up on a pole in the desert to help the people who were sick, Jesus will also be lifted up. If we look to Him and believe in Him, we can be saved. Just like the people needed to trust and look at the snake to get better, we need to trust Jesus to save us because He is God's Son.|I need to create a simplified paraphrase of JHN 3:14 that is understandable for a seven-year-old, keeping in mind the feedback provided by my teachers. I'll ensure that the analogy of Moses and the snake is clear, while also emphasizing the importance of believing in Jesus for salvation. I'll include a bit more context about why the snake was lifted up, connecting it with the previous verse and ensuring clarity on Jesus' divine nature.|
|JHN 3:15|So anyone who believes in Jesus will not be lost but will live forever with God. Just like the people who looked at the snake and were healed, if we trust Jesus, He will help us and give us happiness that lasts forever with God.|I need to simplify the translation to ensure it is accessible to a seven-year-old.

I'll aim for a balance between conveying the spiritual relationship with God and the joy of eternal life, without overly simplifying the message.|
|JHN 3:18|If you believe in God’s Son, you will be safe and have a wonderful life with Him forever. But if you don’t believe, you won’t be with God and that means you’re missing out on His love and happiness forever.|The goal is to revise the translation of John 3:18 to ensure it remains accessible for a seven-year-old while capturing the theological implications of belief and the consequences of unbelief. The new translation should maintain the clarity of the message about salvation through faith in Jesus, avoid implying a simplistic view of happiness, and address the gravity of the choice not to believe without being too complex. Additionally, it should work seamlessly with the context of the previous verse (John 3:17).|
|JHN 3:19|Here’s the important part: God sent Jesus to be like a bright light that shows us how to live. But some people loved their wrong choices (or sins) more than this light. They didn’t want to change and chose to stay in the darkness, missing out on God’s love. Choosing the darkness means they won’t be close to God and His happiness.|I need to revise the translation of John 3:19 by incorporating the suggestions from my teachers.

Additionally, I should maintain the simplicity needed for a seven-year-old to comprehend.|
|JHN 3:20|Some people do wrong things, and they don't want anyone to see them, so they stay away from God's light. But God's light helps us see how much He loves us and shows us the right way to live. When we stay in the dark, we miss out on God's love and the happiness that comes from being close to Him. God wants us to admit our wrong choices and come into His light, where we can be forgiven and make better decisions.|In revising the translation, I need to ensure that I clearly convey the idea of choosing darkness over light, as well as emphasize the consequences of this choice while maintaining the language level appropriate for a seven-year-old.

The focus should be on making it relatable and understandable for a young audience while capturing the essence of the scripture.|
|JHN 3:21|But those who are honest and do what is right come to God's light so everyone can see that their good actions show they love God and want to follow Him.|To revise JHN 3:21, I will focus on making the language simple and clear for a seven-year-old, while ensuring it aligns with the conservative Christian perspective and incorporates the themes of truth, good deeds, and a relationship with God. I'll aim to highlight that coming to God's light is about honesty and living according to His ways, which shows His love and guidance in our lives.|
|JHN 3:22|After that, Jesus and His helpers went to Judea. There, they talked to the people about God's love and how to be kind to one another. Jesus baptized people in water as a special way to show they were choosing to follow Him and wanted to be a part of God's family. This was an important step to help them live the way God wants us to live.|I will ensure that the updated translation clearly communicates the importance of baptism as a spiritual commitment while maintaining clarity for a seven-year-old audience. I will emphasize Jesus' role in teaching and highlight the significance of following Him in a simple way.|
|JHN 3:23|At the same time, John the Baptist was near a place called Aenon, close to Salim. There was lots of water there! Many people came to John because they wanted to be baptized.

The goal is to simplify without losing the core message.|
|JHN 3:25|Some of John’s friends were talking to a Jewish man. They were asking him about the ways people can be made clean and how to please God. They wanted to learn about special things, like washing or purification, that help show love for God.|I need to revise the original paraphrase of John 3:25 by focusing on the concept of purification while still making it accessible to a seven-year-old.

He's the one you said would help people get closer to God. Now he is baptizing people, which is an important way for them to show they want to follow God, and everyone is going to him!"|In updating the translation of JHN 3:26, I will focus on incorporating clarity about the significance of baptism and emphasizing who the special man is, making it relatable for a seven-year-old. I'll ensure that it connects smoothly with the context provided in JHN 3:25.|
