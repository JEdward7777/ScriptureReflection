|JHN 3:1|One night, a man named Nicodemus came to talk to Jesus. He was a leader from a group called the Pharisees, who were religious teachers and Jewish leaders.|I need to incorporate all the important details mentioned by my teachers while still keeping the language simple enough for a seven-year-old. I will make sure to mention that Nicodemus is a leader, part of the Pharisees, and that he came to see Jesus. Additionally, I will simplify the explanation of who the Pharisees are to ensure clarity.|
|JHN 3:2|One night, a man named Nicodemus, who was a leader and teacher among the Jews, came to talk to Jesus. He said, 'Teacher, we know that you are special and have come from God because no one can do the wonderful things you do unless God is helping him.'|To enhance the translation for a seven-year-old, I will incorporate details about Nicodemus being a Jewish leader and a Pharisee, as well as explicitly acknowledging Jesus as a 'Teacher'. I will maintain simple language and concepts to ensure it remains accessible for young readers while preserving the original meaning of respect and recognition of Jesus's divine abilities.|
|JHN 3:3|Jesus answered, "Listen carefully! If someone doesn’t start fresh and become like a little baby again, they can't be part of God's special world."|To create an engaging and simple translation of JHN 3:3 for a seven-year-old, I will incorporate child-friendly language and analogies while maintaining the core message of spiritual rebirth and God's kingdom. The aim is to make the concepts easily relatable and understandable for young children, possibly using examples they can connect with in their everyday experiences.|
|JHN 3:4-5|Nicodemus asked Jesus, "How can someone be born again when they are already old? Can they go back inside their mom to be born again?" Jesus said, "Listen, no one can be part of God’s special world unless they are born with water and the Spirit. This means that we need to have a new life from God inside us."|I will ensure the translation maintains clarity while simplifying theological concepts for a seven-year-old's understanding. I will use accessible language and provide a brief explanation of being 'born from water and the Spirit' to enhance comprehension. I aim to keep the essence of the dialogue while ensuring the message aligns with conservative Christian beliefs.|

But when someone is born from God’s Spirit, they get a new life from God and become part of His family.|I need to create a simplified version of John 3:6 that distinguishes between being born from a mother and being born from the Spirit, emphasizing the spiritual rebirth concept while using language that a seven-year-old can easily understand. I will incorporate the corrections from my teachers to ensure clarity and theological precision without losing the essence of the message.|
|JHN 3:7|Don’t be surprised that I said you need to be born again by God’s Spirit and start a new life with Him.|To create an updated translation for JHN 3:7, I will emphasize the concept of spiritual rebirth and its connection to the Spirit, as highlighted in the teachers' corrections. This will involve adjusting the phrasing to ensure it aligns with the context provided by JHN 3:6, which talks about being born of God's Spirit.|
|JHN 3:8|The wind blows wherever it wants. You can hear it, but you don’t know where it comes from or where it goes. It’s just like the Spirit. When someone is born again by the Spirit, it’s a special change in their life that we can’t see, but we can feel it inside them.|To revise the translation of JHN 3:8, I need to ensure it connects well with the idea presented in JHN 3:7 about being 'born again' by God's Spirit.

|JHN 3:11-12|"I tell you the truth! We are talking about things we know and have seen about God, but you still don’t believe us. If I tell you about things that happen here on Earth and you don’t believe me, how will you believe when I talk about things in Heaven?"|To enhance the translation, I will emphasize the importance of belief in both earthly and heavenly matters, clarify the speaker, and simplify concepts further while keeping the language relatable for a child. I will also ensure it follows the flow of the previous verse.|

I will also ensure that the translation maintains coherence with the preceding verses for better context comprehension.|

They liked doing bad things because they didn’t want to change, and that made them far from God.|I need to rewrite John 3:19 in a way that a seven-year-old can understand while incorporating the concepts of light and darkness symbolizing goodness and sin. I also want to highlight the idea of judgment as a consequence of choosing darkness over light. It is important to keep the language simple but ensure that the key theological points are clear without overwhelming the child with complex ideas.|
