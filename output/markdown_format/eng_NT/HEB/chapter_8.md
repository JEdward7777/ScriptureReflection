|HEB 8:1|Now, the main point of what we are saying is this: We have such a high priest, who has taken his seat at the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens.|The verse emphasizes the position of Christ as our high priest in the heavenly realm, specifically highlighting his authority and the significance of his role at God's right hand. The translation seeks to capture the theological depth of this position while remaining faithful to the original Greek text.|
|HEB 8:2|He serves in the role of a high priest in the true sanctuary, which the Lord set up, and not man.|In this verse, the terms 'high priest' and 'tabernacle' are essential as they link the role of Jesus to the heavenly and divine order established by God, as opposed to earthly institutions. The reference to the 'true tent' suggests a heavenly reality, crafted by God Himself rather than by human hands.|
|HEB 8:3|For every high priest is appointed to offer gifts and sacrifices; therefore, it is necessary that this one also have something to offer.|This verse highlights the role of the high priest, emphasizing the necessity of offering gifts and sacrifices as part of their function. The original Greek phrasing reflects a deliberate connection between the duties of the high priest and the offerings he must present, making it crucial to capture both the solemnity and the requirement of his office in the translation.|
|HEB 8:4|Now if He were on earth, He would not be a priest at all, since there are priests who offer gifts according to the Law.|This verse emphasizes the distinction between the earthly priesthood, which was tied to the Levitical lineage and governed by the Mosaic Law, and the superior heavenly priesthood of Christ, which transcends earthly limitations. The reference to the absence of an earthly priest underscores the uniqueness of Christ's role in the new covenant.|
|HEB 8:5|They serve a copy and shadow of the heavenly things, as Moses was warned when he was about to erect the tabernacle. For He said, 'See that you make all things according to the pattern shown you on the mountain.'|This verse emphasizes the concept of earthly priests serving in a manner that is a reflection or shadow of the true heavenly realities. It refers to the importance of adhering to the divine pattern revealed to Moses, highlighting the contrast between the earthly sanctuary and the heavenly one.|
|HEB 8:6|But now He has obtained a more excellent ministry, inasmuch as He is also Mediator of a better covenant, which was established on better promises.|This translation emphasizes the contrast between the previous priestly system and the new ministry of Christ as the mediator of a superior covenant. The terms used reflect the significance of the 'better promises' associated with this new covenant and Christ's role in mediating these divine commitments.|
|HEB 8:7|For if that first covenant had been faultless, then no place would have been sought for a second.|The phrase 'the first' refers to the original covenant established with Israel, while 'the second' refers to the new covenant initiated by Christ. The terms 'blameless' and 'seek' emphasize the inadequacy of the first covenant in providing true reconciliation with God, necessitating the introduction of a new covenant.|
|HEB 8:8|For God finds fault with them when He says: ‘Behold, the days are coming,’ says the Lord, ‘when I will establish a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah.|This verse emphasizes God's intention to establish a new covenant with Israel and Judah, distinguishing it from the previous covenant by using the term 'new' to highlight a significant renewal in God's relationship with His people. The use of 'days are coming' indicates a prophetic fulfillment, reinforcing God's commitment to His promises.|
|HEB 8:9|Not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers on the day when I took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt; for they did not remain faithful to my covenant, and I disregarded them, says the Lord.|This verse reflects on God's past covenant with Israel, contrasting it with the new covenant He promises to establish. The phrase 'when I took them by the hand' alludes to God's intimate guidance and leadership, while 'they did not remain faithful to my covenant' underscores human unfaithfulness despite divine commitment. The translation captures both the historical and theological significance of the covenant relationship.|
|HEB 8:10|For this is the covenant that I will establish with the house of Israel after those days, says the Lord: I will place my laws into their minds, and I will write them on their hearts; and I will be their God, and they shall be my people.|This verse speaks of a new covenant that God establishes with His people, emphasizing the internalization of His laws and a personal relationship with them. The phrases 'put my law within them' and 'write it on their hearts' highlight the transformation that takes place under this new covenant.|
|HEB 8:11|And no one will teach his neighbor, nor will anyone teach his brother, saying, 'Know the Lord,' for all will know me, from the least to the greatest of them.|This verse emphasizes the internal knowledge and relationship with God, contrasting with the prior systems where individuals were taught about God from others. The phrase 'know the Lord' signifies a deep, personal relationship that transcends mere knowledge or instruction.|
|HEB 8:12|For I will be merciful toward their wrongdoings, and their sins and lawless deeds I will remember no more.|The verse emphasizes God's mercy and the total erasure of sin, reflecting a promise of new covenant relationship. Key terms such as 'iniquities' and 'sins' indicate wrongdoing, while 'remember no more' illustrates God's intention to not hold these against humanity.|
|HEB 8:13|In saying 'a new covenant,' He has made the first obsolete; and what is becoming obsolete and growing old is ready to vanish away.|The Greek term 'καινὴν' indicates something new, while 'παλαιούμενον' suggests the process of aging or becoming obsolete.
