|HEB 1:1|Long ago, God spoke many times and in various ways to our ancestors through the prophets, but in these last days, He has spoken to us by His Son.|The phrase 'in many ways and at many times' reflects the diverse methods of communication God has used throughout history, and 'in these last days' highlights the finality of His revelation through Christ. The term 'Son' emphasizes the unique relationship and authority of Jesus in this divine communication.|
|HEB 1:2|But in these last days, He has appointed His Son as heir of all things, through whom He also made the ages.|In this verse, the emphasis is on Jesus Christ as the appointed heir of all creation and the one through whom God established the ages. The use of 'heir' implies not only ownership but also a relationship of authority and significance that Christ holds over all creation, consistent with themes present in other New Testament texts regarding His divine role and creative power.|
|HEB 1:3|He is the radiance of His glory and the exact representation of His essence, sustaining all things by His powerful word. After making purification for our sins, He sat down at the right hand of the Majesty on high.|The Greek terms used in this verse carry profound theological significance. 'ἀπαύγασμα' (apaugasma) refers to the radiance or effulgence of God's glory, indicating a direct relationship with divine majesty. 'χαρακτὴρ' (character) implies the exact representation of God's being, reflecting Christ's nature. 'ῥήματι' (rhemati) translates to 'word' in this context, showcasing His authoritative command over creation. This verse beautifully encapsulates the dual roles of Christ as both the divine nature and as the redemptive sacrifice, affirming His exalted position in heaven after atoning for sin.|
|HEB 1:4|Having become as much superior to the angels as the name he has inherited is more excellent than theirs.|This verse emphasizes the superiority of Christ over angels, highlighting the unique authority and divine status He possesses as the Son of God, particularly the inheritance of a name that signifies His unique relationship with the Father and His sovereign authority.|
|HEB 1:5|For to which of the angels did God ever say, 'You are my Son; today I have begotten you'? And again, 'I will be a Father to him, and he shall be a Son to me'?|This verse emphasizes the unique relationship between God and Jesus as His Son. The terms 'Son' and 'Father' are vital in expressing this divine relationship. The reference to being 'begotten' highlights the eternal nature of this relationship as well as its distinctiveness from human parentage.|
|HEB 1:6|But when He again brings the Firstborn into the world, He says, 'Let all the angels of God worship Him.'|In this verse, the term 'firstborn' (πρωτότοκον) signifies a special status and preeminence, referring to Christ's unique relationship with God. The phrase 'let all the angels of God worship him' emphasizes the authority and divinity of Christ, calling all heavenly beings to honor Him. The use of 'oikoumene' (οἰκουμένη), meaning 'the inhabited world,' suggests the universality of Christ's lordship.|
|HEB 1:7|Of the angels He says, 'He makes His angels spirits, and His ministers a flame of fire.'|This translation captures the distinction between angels as spiritual beings and their role as ministers of God's will. The term 'spirits' refers to the immaterial nature of angels, while 'flame of fire' symbolizes their powerful and purifying presence.|
|HEB 1:8|But of the Son, He says, 'Your throne, O God, is forever and ever; the scepter of righteousness is the scepter of your kingdom.'|The term 'throne' reflects the royal authority of Christ as the Son of God, while 'scepter' symbolizes the power and righteousness of His rule. The use of 'eternal' emphasizes the everlasting nature of His kingship. The verse underscores the supremacy of the Son over all, distinguishing Him from angels.|
|HEB 1:9|You have loved righteousness and hated lawlessness; therefore God, your God, has anointed you with the oil of gladness beyond your companions.|This translation emphasizes the concepts of love for righteousness and hatred for lawlessness, tying it to the anointing with joy. The use of 'gladness' instead of 'joy' maintains the essence of the original Greek, and the phrase 'beyond your companions' draws attention to the exalted status granted by God.|
|HEB 1:10|And, "You, Lord, in the beginning laid the foundation of the earth, and the heavens are the works of your hands;"|The phrase 'you laid the foundation' suggests God's role as the creator and architect of the universe, reflecting both power and intentionality in the act of creation. The emphasis on the heavens as the work of His hands implies a personal touch in the creative process, indicating that God’s creation is not just a distant act but involves His direct engagement with the cosmos.|
|HEB 1:11|They will perish, but you remain; and all of them will become old like a garment.|This verse contrasts the eternal nature of God with the temporary nature of creation. The imagery of garments signifies the transitory aspect of the universe compared to the unchanging existence of God.|
|HEB 1:12|Like a cloak, you will fold them up, and they will be changed. But you are the same, and your years will never come to an end.|The original Greek text employs metaphors related to garments and change, emphasizing the contrast between the impermanence of creation and the eternal nature of God. The translation maintains the vivid imagery of clothing to illustrate how creation will be transformed while affirming the unchanging character of God.|
|HEB 1:13|But to which of the angels has He ever said, 'Sit at My right hand until I make your enemies a footstool for your feet?'|The phrase 'Sit at my right hand' reflects the position of honor and authority bestowed upon Christ, suggesting his reign and sovereignty. The mention of enemies being made a footstool indicates a complete victory over adversaries, reinforcing the idea of divine authority. This verse highlights the contrast between angels and Christ, affirming Christ's unique exalted status.|
|HEB 1:14|Are not all angels ministering spirits sent to serve those who will inherit salvation?|This verse highlights the role of angels as ministering spirits sent to serve those who are to inherit salvation.
