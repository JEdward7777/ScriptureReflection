|HEB 13:1|Let brotherly love continue; do not forget to show hospitality to strangers.|The verse emphasizes the importance of brotherly love and hospitality as key aspects of Christian community. The use of ' φιλαδελφία' (brotherly love) indicates a deep, familial bond among believers, while ' φιλοξενία' (hospitality) refers to welcoming others graciously, especially strangers or those in need. The phrasing is kept straightforward to maintain clarity in English.|
|HEB 13:2|For by doing so, some have unknowingly welcomed angels.|The phrase 'show hospitality to strangers' underscores the importance of welcoming those who are outside our immediate circles. The reference to angels serves as a reminder of the unseen presence of God and His messengers among us, often in the guise of those in need.|
|HEB 13:3|Remember those in prison as if you were their fellow prisoners, and those who are mistreated as if you yourselves were suffering in the body.|In this verse, the author of Hebrews emphasizes the importance of empathy and solidarity with those who are imprisoned and those who are mistreated. The phrase ‘as though in prison with them’ conveys a strong sense of connection and shared experience, urging believers to remember those in distress as if they themselves were suffering alongside them. The use of ‘body’ at the end of the verse underscores the physical and communal nature of their suffering, encouraging an awareness of the realities faced by others in the body of Christ.|
|HEB 13:4|Let marriage be honored by all, and let the marriage bed be kept undefiled; for God will judge the sexually immoral and adulterers.|This translation emphasizes the sanctity of marriage and the purity expected within it, reflecting both the moral teachings of the New Testament and the consequences outlined for sexual immorality.

The phrase 'I will never leave you nor forsake you' reflects God's constant support and assurance to His people, resonating throughout Scripture, particularly in the context of faith and dependence on Him.|
|HEB 13:6|So we confidently say, 'The Lord is my helper; I will not be afraid. What can man do to me?'|The Greek term 'θαρώ' (tharō) suggests a strong sense of courage or boldness, and the phrase 'Κύριος ἐμοὶ βοηθός' (The Lord is my helper) indicates reliance on divine support against fears instigated by human threats. This translation emphasizes the contrast between human fear and the assurance of God's help.|
|HEB 13:7|Remember your leaders, those who spoke to you the word of God. Consider the outcome of their way of life and imitate their faith.|In this translation, 'leaders' is used to denote those who have authority in the community.

|HEB 13:9|Do not be led away by various and strange teachings; for it is good for the heart to be strengthened by grace, not by foods, which have not benefited those who are devoted to them.|This verse contrasts the reliance on external teachings or dietary laws with the solid foundation that grace provides. It highlights the significance of a heart established by grace rather than by observances that do not ultimately benefit spiritual growth.|
|HEB 13:10|We have an altar from which those who serve in the tabernacle have no right to eat.|In this verse, the author highlights the distinction between the Christian's spiritual altar and the physical one used by the Levitical priests in the Old Testament. The focus here is on the sufficiency of Christ's sacrifice and the resultant spiritual freedom from the ceremonial laws that governed the Jewish worshipers in the temple. This encapsulates the essence of the new covenant.|
|HEB 13:11|For the bodies of those animals whose blood is brought into the Holy Places by the high priest as a sacrifice for sin are burned outside the camp.|This verse highlights the symbolism of the sacrificial system and its fulfillment in Christ. The act of burning the bodies outside the camp signifies the removal of sin from the community and points to Christ's ultimate sacrifice. The language used indicates a strong contrast between the rituals of the Old Covenant and the sacrifice of Christ, emphasizing His role as the true High Priest.|
|HEB 13:12|Therefore, Jesus also suffered outside the gate, in order to sanctify the people through His own blood.|This verse emphasizes the sacrificial aspect of Jesus' death outside the city walls, connecting it to the sacrificial system of the Old Testament, where sacrifices for sin were made outside the camp.

|HEB 13:15|Through Him then, let us continually offer a sacrifice of praise to God, that is, the fruit of lips that acknowledge His name.|In this verse, the author emphasizes the importance of offering praise to God, which is described metaphorically as a 'sacrifice of praise.' This reflects the Levitical traditions of sacrificial offerings, transformed in the Christian context into expressions of worship through speech and acknowledgment of God. The phrase 'fruit of lips' suggests the natural outcome of a heart attuned to God's glory.|
|HEB 13:16|And do not forget to do good and to share with others, for with such sacrifices God is pleased.|In this verse, 'eupoiia' (good works) and 'koinonia' (fellowship/community) suggest an emphasis on the acts of kindness and mutual support that please God. The term 'sacrifice' here indicates a voluntary offering rather than a ritualistic act, focusing on the heart behind the actions.|
|HEB 13:17|Obey your leaders and submit to them, for they keep watch over your souls as those who must give an account. Let them do this with joy and not with grief, for that would be of no advantage to you.|This verse emphasizes the importance of obedience and submission to church leaders, reflecting the responsibility they carry in caring for the spiritual well-being of their congregation. The term 'leaders' is derived from a Greek term that connotes guidance and authority, suggesting a structure of respect within the church community. The encouragement to act with joy rather than groaning underscores the relational aspect of leadership in the church, focusing on mutual respect and the well-being of both leaders and members.|
|HEB 13:18|Pray for us; for we are sure that we have a good conscience, desiring to conduct ourselves honorably in all things.|The phrase "good conscience" is important here, as it reflects the inner moral and ethical understanding of the speaker.

This reflects the pastoral tone of the epistle, emphasizing care and desire for the community's wellbeing.|

The use of 'brothers' emphasizes the familial bond within the body of Christ. 'For a brief word' suggests the urgency and importance of the message that follows.|
|HEB 13:23|Know that our brother Timothy has been released; with whom, if he comes soon, I shall see you.|This verse emphasizes the relationship between the writer and Timothy, highlighting the importance of Timothy's impending arrival and the connection with the audience. The phrase 'the brother Timothy' signifies a close, familial bond in the Christian community. The term 'released' is understood as 'freed from imprisonment' or 'set free', indicating a significant event in Timothy's life. The phrase 'if he comes soon' expresses anticipation and the hope of reunion.|
|HEB 13:24|Greet all your leaders and all the saints. Those from Italy send you greetings.|The term 'leaders' (ἡγουμένους) is translated as 'those in authority' to emphasize their spiritual role. The word 'saints' (ἁγίους) refers to the community of believers, suggesting a collective greeting. The mention of 'those from Italy' serves to establish a connection with the broader Christian community, indicating unity among believers across regions.|
|HEB 13:25|May the grace be with all of you. Amen.|The phrase 'the grace' refers to God's unmerited favor and blessing, which is a central theme in Christian theology.
