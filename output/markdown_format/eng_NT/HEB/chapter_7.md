| Reference | Verse | Translation Notes |
|:---------:|-------|-------------------|
|HEB 7:1|For this Melchizedek, king of Salem, priest of God Most High, met Abraham returning from the defeat of the kings and blessed him.|In this translation, emphasis is placed on Melchizedek's dual role as both king and priest, and his significant encounter with Abraham, which illustrates the authority and blessing he possessed from God. The phrase 'God Most High' reflects the Hebrew name for God that emphasizes His sovereignty and greatness.|
|HEB 7:2|To whom also Abraham gave a tenth part of all; first being translated, 'king of righteousness,' and then also king of Salem, which is 'king of peace.'|In this verse, the Hebrew concept of tithing and the identities of kingship and priesthood are intertwined. Melchizedek is described not only as a king but specifically as the 'king of righteousness' and 'king of peace', reflecting his dual role and significance. The translation seeks to preserve this rich theological meaning while using clear and contemporary English.|
|HEB 7:3|Without father, without mother, without genealogy, having neither beginning of days nor end of life, but made like the Son of God, remains a priest forever.|This verse emphasizes the eternal priesthood of Melchizedek, depicting his uniqueness in being without genealogical records and highlighting his role as a type of Christ. The terms used suggest a spiritual lineage rather than a physical one, indicating a priesthood that transcends time and human ancestry.|
|HEB 7:4|Consider how great this man was, to whom even the patriarch Abraham gave a tenth of the best spoils.|The verse emphasizes the significance of Melchizedek and the act of giving a tithe. The reference to Abraham establishes the ancient and honored tradition of tithing, highlighting its importance in the faith. The use of 'patriarch' signifies the authority and status of Abraham, and the phrase 'from the best spoils' denotes a recognition of worthiness in the offering given.|
|HEB 7:5|And those who are of the sons of Levi, who receive the priesthood, are commanded to collect a tithe from the people according to the law, that is, from their fellow countrymen, even though they have descended from the loins of Abraham.|In this translation, the focus is on the act of the Levites receiving the priesthood and their obligation to tithe, which reinforces the system established in the law. The word 'tithe' and the context of Levites and Abraham are maintained to reflect the original message.|
|HEB 7:6|But this man, who does not have a genealogy among them, has collected a tithe from Abraham and blessed the one who has the promises.|This verse emphasizes the unique status of Melchizedek, highlighting that he did not have a genealogical claim among the Levites, yet he performed the act of tithing to Abraham. The verb used for 'blessed' in this context underscores a divine approval, while 'tithing' denotes the acknowledgment of spiritual authority.|
|HEB 7:7|Without any dispute, the lesser is blessed by the greater.|In this verse, the focus is on the act of blessing and the authority behind it. The Greek word 'κρείττον' refers to one who is greater, emphasizing the superior position of the one doing the blessing. The term 'ἀντιλογία' indicates a form of dispute or contradiction, which in this context suggests the unquestionable nature of the blessing given.|
|HEB 7:8|Here, mortal men receive tithes, but there, it is testified that He lives.|This verse emphasizes the distinction between earthly priests who receive tithes and Melchizedek, who represents an eternal priesthood. The reference to living testimony contrasts the temporary nature of mortal priests with the enduring life of Christ, the eternal priest.|
|HEB 7:9|And to put it another way, through Abraham, even Levi, who receives tithes, was, in a manner of speaking, tithed.|This verse discusses the theological implications of tithing as it relates to the lineage of Abraham and Levi. The phrase 'by way of speaking' indicates a deeper spiritual truth about representation and lineage, emphasizing that Levi, though not yet born, is in a sense included in Abraham's act of giving a tithe to Melchizedek. This reflects the priestly authority that extends beyond mere lineage, rooting in faith and obedience.|
|HEB 7:10|For he was still in the loins of his father when Melchizedek met him.|In this verse, the phrase 'ἐν τῇ ὀσφύϊ τοῦ πατρὸς' literally translates to 'in the loins of his father,' emphasizing the idea of Levi being considered as present in Abraham at the time of his encounter with Melchizedek. The reference to the act of being 'tithing' is tied to the broader theme of priesthood and the lineage of Levi in relation to Melchizedek's unique priesthood.|
|HEB 7:11|Now if perfection was attainable through the Levitical priesthood (for under it the people received the law), what further need was there for another priest to arise, one after the order of Melchizedek, rather than one named after the order of Aaron?|This verse addresses the inadequacy of the Levitical priesthood and questions the necessity of another priest arising according to the order of Melchizedek. The emphasis is on the distinctiveness of Melchizedek’s priesthood compared to that of Aaron.|
|HEB 7:12|For when there is a change in the priesthood, there is necessarily a change in the law as well.|This verse highlights the transition from the Levitical priesthood to the priesthood of Christ, emphasizing the necessity of a change due to the inadequacy of the former system to achieve perfection.|
|HEB 7:13|For the one about whom these things are said belonged to another tribe, from which no one has ever served at the altar.|The verse refers to the shift from the Levitical priesthood to the order of Melchizedek, indicating that Jesus, coming from the tribe of Judah, is a high priest without the typical lineage of Levi, which was central to the Old Covenant priesthood. The phrase 'another tribe' emphasizes the uniqueness of Christ's priestly role.|
|HEB 7:14|For it is evident that our Lord arose from Judah, a tribe concerning which Moses spoke nothing about priesthood.|This verse emphasizes the significance of the tribe of Judah in the context of priesthood and leadership, pointing to the unique role of Jesus as our Lord and High Priest, stemming from this lineage, rather than the Levitical line. The phrasing used in this translation seeks to maintain the gravity and clarity of the original Greek, highlighting the authority of Jesus as established by His lineage.|
|HEB 7:15|And it is even more evident when another priest arises in the likeness of Melchizedek.|The verse emphasizes the uniqueness of the priesthood of Jesus by comparing it to Melchizedek, a figure who appears without a genealogical background in scripture, highlighting the divine appointment of Christ's priesthood.|
|HEB 7:16|who has become a priest not through a commandment of physical descent, but by the power of an indestructible life.|This verse contrasts the temporary priesthood established by the Mosaic Law with the eternal priesthood represented by Jesus, emphasizing that Jesus' priesthood is based not on legalistic commands but on the indestructible life that He embodies.|
|HEB 7:17|For it testifies that you are a priest forever according to the order of Melchizedek.|This translation emphasizes the eternal priesthood of Jesus Christ in the context of the priestly order established by Melchizedek, reflecting on the unique and divinely ordained nature of His priesthood. The use of 'witnesses' or 'testifies' aligns with the authoritative claim that Jesus fulfills this eternal role as high priest.|
|HEB 7:18|For on one hand, a former commandment is set aside because of its weakness and ineffectiveness.|This verse reflects on the cancellation or setting aside of the previous commandment due to its weakness and ineffectiveness, which is a common theme in Hebrews regarding the contrast between the old covenant and the new covenant established through Christ.|
|HEB 7:19|For the law made nothing perfect; but a better hope is introduced, through which we draw near to God.|This verse emphasizes the insufficiency of the Law in achieving perfection and introduces a better hope through faith. The phrase 'better hope' connects to the concept of a new covenant that brings believers closer to God, contrasting with the limitations of the Mosaic Law.|
|HEB 7:20|And inasmuch as He was not made priest without an oath; for those priests were made without an oath, but He was made priest with an oath.|In this verse, the emphasis is placed on the significance of priesthood and the distinction made between the Levitical priests and the priesthood of Christ. The absence of an oath in the Levitical priesthood contrasts with the oath taken by God regarding Christ’s priesthood, highlighting the permanence and authority of Christ's role as high priest.|
|HEB 7:21|but He with an oath by the one who said to Him: ‘The Lord has sworn and will not change His mind; You are a priest forever according to the order of Melchizedek.’|This verse emphasizes the divine oath that establishes Jesus as a priest forever, which is contrasted with the human priests of the Levitical line who did not receive their position through such an oath. The use of 'Lord' reflects the authority of God making the declaration, reinforcing the eternal nature of Christ's priesthood.|
|HEB 7:22|By so much more, Jesus has become the surety of a better covenant.|In this verse, 'a better covenant' highlights the superior nature of the new priestly order established by Jesus. The term 'surety' signifies that Jesus guarantees the fulfillment of this covenant, underscoring His role as a reliable mediator between God and humanity.|
|HEB 7:23|And indeed, many had become priests, because they were prevented by death from continuing in office;.|The focus of this verse is on the permanence of Christ’s priesthood compared to the temporary nature of the Levitical priests, emphasizing that they could not remain due to death, while Christ remains forever due to His resurrection and eternal life.|
|HEB 7:24|But He, because He remains forever, has an untransferable priesthood.|The term 'untransferable' reflects the permanent nature of Christ's priesthood, unlike the temporary priesthoods that ended with death. The phrase 'for all ages' emphasizes the eternal aspect of Christ's ministry.|
|HEB 7:25|Therefore, He is able to save completely those who approach God through Him, since He always lives to intercede for them.|This verse emphasizes the ability of Christ to save completely those who draw near to God through Him, underlining His eternal role as a living intercessor. The phrase 'to save completely' implies not only the assurance of salvation but also the ongoing support He provides to believers. The terms 'draw near' and 'intercede' highlight the intimate relationship between Christ and those who come to God.|
|HEB 7:26|Such a High Priest truly meets our needs: holy, innocent, unstained, separated from sinners, and exalted above the heavens.|The verse emphasizes the qualifications of Christ as our High Priest, highlighting His holiness, sinlessness, separation from sinners, and His exalted position in the heavens. This fresh translation aims to capture the essence of these attributes while ensuring clarity and accessibility.|
|HEB 7:27|He does not need to offer sacrifices every day, as the high priests do, first for their own sins and then for the sins of the people; he sacrificed for their sins once for all when he offered up himself.|This verse emphasizes the uniqueness of Christ's sacrifice compared to the repeated sacrifices of the Levitical priests. Unlike those priests, who needed to offer sacrifices daily for their own sins and then for the people, Christ offered himself once and for all, fulfilling the requirement of atonement in a single act.|
|HEB 7:28|For the Law appoints men as high priests who are weak, but the word of the oath, which came after the Law, appoints a Son who has been made perfect forever.|This verse contrasts the human high priests appointed by the Law with Jesus, who was made perfect and eternal through His divine oath, emphasizing His unique and everlasting priesthood as opposed to the frailty of human priests.|
