| Reference | Verse | Translation Notes |
|:---------:|-------|-------------------|
|HEB 5:1|For every high priest, chosen from among men, is appointed on behalf of men in matters relating to God, to offer gifts and sacrifices for sins.|This verse emphasizes the role of the high priest in representing the people before God, highlighting the necessity of offering gifts and sacrifices for sins. The use of 'ἀρχιερεὺς' indicates a chief or high priest, and 'ἀνθρώπων' points to the human nature of the priest, which is crucial for his mediation role. The words 'δώρα τε καὶ θυσίας' signify both offerings and sacrifices, essential in the Levitical priesthood and in understanding Christ's ultimate sacrifice.|
|HEB 5:2|He can deal gently with those who are ignorant and going astray, since he himself is beset by weakness.|This verse speaks to the compassion and understanding of a high priest towards those who are unaware or led astray, emphasizing the shared human condition of weakness. The translation reflects the balance of strength and vulnerability in the role of the priest.|
|HEB 5:3|And for this reason, he is obligated, just as for the people, so also for himself to offer sacrifices for sins.|The phrase ' προσφέρειν ὑπὲρ ἁμαρτιῶν' suggests the act of offering or presenting a sacrifice for sins. The translation reflects the duty of a priest to mediate not only for the people but also for himself, emphasizing human frailty and the need for atonement. The structure mirrors that of verse 2, maintaining coherence in context.|
|HEB 5:4|And no one takes this honor upon himself, but only when called by God, just as Aaron was.|The phrase 'οὐχ ἑαυτῷ' emphasizes that no one appoints themselves to this honor, which is a significant theological point in the context of divine calling. The comparison with Aaron underscores the continuity of the priesthood established by God.|
|HEB 5:5|In the same way, Christ did not glorify Himself to become a high priest, but it was He who said to Him, 'You are my Son; today I have begotten You.'|The verse emphasizes that Christ did not elevate Himself to the position of high priest; instead, He was appointed by God, underscoring the divine authority behind His priesthood. The phrase 'You are my son' refers to the unique relationship between Jesus and God the Father, affirming His identity and mission.|
|HEB 5:6|As also He says in another place, 'You are a priest forever according to the order of Melchizedek.'|In this verse, the phrase 'You are a priest forever' reflects the eternal nature of Christ's priesthood, which is likened to that of Melchizedek, a significant figure in biblical history who served both as king and priest. The term 'order' refers to a specific line or lineage of priesthood, highlighting the unique role Christ fulfills.|
|HEB 5:7|Who in the days of His flesh offered up prayers and supplications with vehement cries and tears to Him who was able to save Him from death, and was heard because of His godly fear.|In this verse, the author emphasizes the intense emotional state of Jesus during His earthly life, showcasing both His human vulnerability and His relationship with God. The phrases 'strong crying' and 'tears' convey deep distress, highlighting the fervor and sincerity of His prayers. This verse reflects on the duality of Christ as both human and divine, showing that His prayers were earnest and impactful, reflecting a life fully lived in submission and reverence to God.|
|HEB 5:8|Though He was a Son, He learned obedience through the things which He suffered.|In this verse, the emphasis is on the duality of Christ's identity as the Son of God and His learning through suffering. The phrase 'learning obedience' reflects His submission to God's will through His experiences, particularly the trials He faced.|
|HEB 5:9|And having been perfected, He became the source of eternal salvation for all who obey Him.|In this verse, the terms 'perfected' and 'obedience' are emphasized. The Greek word 'τελειωθεὶς' indicates a process of completion or perfection that comes through experience and obedience, specifically in the context of suffering. The phrase 'author of eternal salvation' conveys the idea of Jesus as the source or origin of salvation for those who obey Him, highlighting the dual themes of obedience and divine authority.|
|HEB 5:10|Designated by God as a high priest according to the order of Melchizedek.|This verse emphasizes the divine appointment of Jesus as a high priest in the order of Melchizedek, highlighting both His priestly role and the uniqueness of that order compared to the Levitical priesthood.|
|HEB 5:11|Concerning this, we have much to say, but it is hard to explain, since you have become sluggish in your hearing.|In this verse, the author expresses frustration over the spiritual maturity of the audience, indicating that they have become dull in their ability to hear and understand deeper truths. The phrase 'much we have to say' suggests an abundance of knowledge yet ungrasped, while 'hard to explain' emphasizes the challenge posed by their lack of readiness. The term 'dull' signifies a spiritual sluggishness that has hindered their growth in understanding.|
|HEB 5:12|For though by this time you ought to be teachers, you again need someone to teach you the basic principles of God’s words. You have come to need milk, not solid food.|This verse highlights the responsibility of believers to grow in their understanding of God’s word. The metaphor of 'milk' represents basic teachings, while 'solid food' signifies a deeper, more mature understanding of Scripture. The admonition serves as a reminder of the need for spiritual growth over time.|
|HEB 5:13|For everyone who partakes of milk is unskilled in the word of righteousness, for he is a child.|The term 'milk' in this verse is used metaphorically to refer to basic teachings of the faith, while 'solid food' represents deeper, more mature understanding of God’s Word. The context of spiritual maturity is important in this verse, indicating a need for growth beyond the elementary principles.|
|HEB 5:14|But solid food belongs to those who are of full age, those who by reason of use have their senses exercised to discern both good and evil.|In this verse, the emphasis is placed on the maturity and discernment of believers. The term 'solid food' refers to deeper spiritual truths meant for those who have developed their senses through practice. This contrasts with the previous verse, highlighting the need for growth beyond the basic teachings of the faith.|
