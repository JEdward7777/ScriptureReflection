|HEB 9:1|Now, indeed, the first tabernacle had regulations for worship and an earthly sanctuary.|This verse emphasizes the existence and significance of the first tabernacle in the context of worship and its relation to the heavenly realities that are fulfilled in Christ. The use of 'holy' and 'worldly' contrasts the sacredness of God's dwelling with the earthly constructs, hinting at the transition to a new covenant.|

The term 'Holy Place' (Ἅγια) indicates its sacred significance. The use of specific items such as the lampstand and table of showbread reflects their liturgical roles in worship and divine fellowship.|
|HEB 9:3|But behind the second veil stood the tabernacle known as the Holy of Holies.|In this verse, the term 'Holy of Holies' (Ἅγια Ἁγίων) is used to refer to the most sacred space in the tabernacle, which is a significant theological point, indicating the divine presence of God. The context of the verse emphasizes the separation between God and man, which was remedied by Christ's sacrifice.|
|HEB 9:4|having a golden censer and the Ark of the Covenant covered on all sides with gold, in which was a golden pot holding the manna, and Aaron's rod that budded, and the tablets of the covenant.|The verse outlines the sacred items contained within the Ark of the Covenant and their significance in the context of the Old Testament priesthood. The focus is on the gold, which symbolizes divine presence and purity, as well as the items that testify to God's provision and leadership over His people.|
|HEB 9:5|And above it were the cherubim of glory, overshadowing the mercy seat; about which we cannot now speak in detail.|In this verse, the term 'cherubim' signifies the celestial beings that overshadow the mercy seat. The phrase 'of glory' emphasizes the divine presence associated with the mercy seat. The latter part of the verse, which suggests the inability to speak in detail, highlights the mystery and reverence surrounding these sacred elements.|
|HEB 9:6|Now, when these things had been prepared this way, the priests regularly enter the first tent to carry out their sacred duties.|The verse captures the ongoing duty of the priests in the first tabernacle, emphasizing their continuous role in worship as set forth in the Old Testament. The use of 'first tent' and 'always' emphasizes the regularity of their service, linking back to the context of divine order and worship in the tabernacle system.|
|HEB 9:7|But into the second part, the high priest enters alone once a year, not without blood, which he offers for himself and for the ignorant sins of the people.|This verse emphasizes the uniqueness of the high priest's annual sacrifice on behalf of himself and the people, highlighting the significance of atonement through blood. The phrase 'once a year' signifies the singular nature of this act, distinct from the regular duties performed by the priests. The inclusion of 'the blood' emphasizes the sacrificial element required for atonement.|
|HEB 9:8|The Holy Spirit was making this clear: that the way into the holiest place was not yet revealed as long as the first tabernacle was still standing.|This verse reflects the concept of the Holy Spirit revealing truths about the way of the saints, which is connected to the idea of the first tabernacle still being in place, symbolizing the limitation of the old covenant until Christ's revelation and sacrifice.|
|HEB 9:9|This is an illustration for the present time, showing that the gifts and sacrifices being offered cannot perfect the worshiper in regard to conscience.|This verse explains the limitations of the gifts and sacrifices offered in the Old Covenant, indicating that they cannot bring about true spiritual perfection or cleanse the worshiper's conscience, as they are mere symbols pointing to a greater reality in Christ.|
|HEB 9:10|They pertain only to food and drink, various ritual washings, and fleshly ordinances, imposed until the time of reformation.|In this verse, the terms related to food ('βρώμασι') and drink ('πόμασι') highlight the temporary nature of ceremonial laws. 'Διαφόροις βαπτισμοῖς' refers to various washings or ritual baptisms that were significant in Jewish tradition but ultimately limited in their ability to bring about true spiritual cleansing. The phrase 'μέχρι καιροῦ διορθώσεως' suggests a period awaiting a transformative correction, which ties into the overarching theme of Christ's fulfillment of the law and perfect sacrifice.|
|HEB 9:11|But Christ appeared as a High Priest of the good things to come, through the greater and more perfect tabernacle, not made with hands, that is, not of this creation.|This verse emphasizes the unique and superior role of Christ as the High Priest in the heavenly sanctuary, contrasting with the earthly tabernacle made by hands. The term 'greater and more perfect tent' signifies the divine origin of the heavenly dwelling, distinct from the physical creation.|
|HEB 9:12|He did not enter by the blood of goats and calves, but by His own blood He entered the Most Holy Place once for all, obtaining eternal redemption.|This verse highlights the contrast between the sacrificial system of the Old Testament, which involved the blood of animals, and the once-for-all sacrifice of Christ, whose own blood provides eternal redemption. The term 'eternal redemption' emphasizes the finality and completeness of the sacrifice made by Christ compared to the temporary nature of animal sacrifices.|
|HEB 9:13|For if the blood of bulls and goats and the ashes of a heifer sprinkling the unclean sanctify for the purification of the flesh,|In this verse, the writer highlights the significance of the blood from sacrificial animals in the Old Testament as a means of purification, while contrasting it with the greater and ultimate sacrifice of Christ. The terms 'sprinkling' and 'cleansing' resonate with the established Old Testament practices, reinforcing the theological concept of purification in a more profound manner through Christ's sacrifice.|
|HEB 9:14|How much more will the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered Himself without blemish to God, cleanse your conscience from dead works to serve the living God?|This verse emphasizes the superiority of Christ's sacrifice over the old covenant sacrifices, highlighting the cleansing power of His blood through the eternal Spirit, which purifies the conscience to serve the living God. The terms used reflect themes of purity, sacrifice, and divine service.|
|HEB 9:15|And for this reason, He is the Mediator of a new covenant, so that, upon the death that occurred for the redemption of the transgressions committed under the first covenant, those who are called may receive the promise of the eternal inheritance.|The phrase 'Mediator of a new covenant' emphasizes the role of Christ as the intermediary between God and humanity. The term 'redemption' signifies liberation through the death of Christ, reflecting the Hebrew notion of atonement, while 'eternal inheritance' indicates the everlasting blessings promised to the believers.|
|HEB 9:16|For where there is a covenant, it is necessary that the death of the one who made it be presented.|This verse discusses the necessity of death for a covenant (or will) to be validated, aligning with the idea that a new covenant requires a significant act, namely the death of Christ, to establish its validity.|
|HEB 9:17|For a covenant is enforced only in the presence of the dead; it is never valid while the one who made it is alive.|The phrase 'upon the dead' emphasizes that the validity of the covenant is dependent on the death of the one who established it. This verse highlights the necessity of death in the context of covenants, paralleling legal understandings of wills and inheritances.|
|HEB 9:18|Therefore, even the first covenant was not dedicated without blood.|This verse emphasizes that even the first covenant was not inaugurated without the shedding of blood, signifying the importance of sacrifice in establishing any covenant, reflecting the sacrificial system in the Old Testament and its fulfillment in Christ.|
|HEB 9:19|For when every commandment had been declared by Moses to all the people according to the law, he took the blood of calves and goats, with water, scarlet wool, and hyssop, and sprinkled both the book itself and all the people.|This verse describes the actions taken by Moses during the covenant ceremony, emphasizing the ritualistic use of blood in the establishment of the law. The inclusion of water, scarlet wool, and hyssop highlights the purification aspect of the ceremony.|
|HEB 9:20|saying, "This is the blood of the covenant that God commanded you."|The phrase 'the blood of the covenant' in this verse connects back to the Old Testament concept of blood as a sign of covenantal agreement, which is significant for understanding the New Covenant established by Christ. The word 'covenant' (διαθήκη) denotes a solemn agreement, and in this context, signifies the relationship between God and His people as mediated through Christ’s sacrifice.|
|HEB 9:21|And he sprinkled both the tent and all the vessels of the ministry with the blood in like manner.|The phrase 'and the tent' refers to the tabernacle, the dwelling place of God among His people, and 'all the vessels of the ministry' encompasses the various instruments used in worship and sacrifice. The verb 'sprinkled' (ἐρράντισε) indicates a ritualistic action performed with blood, which signifies the covenant and sanctification.|
|HEB 9:22|And almost all things are purified with blood according to the law, and without the shedding of blood there is no forgiveness.|The verse highlights the significance of blood in the context of purification and forgiveness according to the law. The emphasis on blood being necessary for cleansing serves as a crucial theological point in the understanding of atonement and redemption in Christian doctrine.|
|HEB 9:23|Thus, it was necessary for the copies of the heavenly things to be purified with these rites, but the heavenly things themselves require better sacrifices than these.|In this verse, the contrast is drawn between the earthly and heavenly realities of purification. The term 'copies' refers to the sacrifices and rituals in the Old Covenant, which were foreshadowing the ultimate sacrifice. The phrase 'heavenly things' implies a greater, more perfect purification that transcends the temporary and imperfect sacrifices made on earth. This understanding highlights the significance of Christ’s sacrifice in contrast to those earlier rituals.|
|HEB 9:24|For Christ did not enter a sanctuary made by human hands, which is only a copy of the true one; but He entered into heaven itself, now to appear in the presence of God on our behalf.|This verse emphasizes the contrast between the earthly tabernacle and the heavenly realm where Christ ministers. The 'handmade sanctuaries' refer to the physical structures of worship established by man, while the 'true ones' point to the divine realities in heaven. Christ's entrance into the heavenly sanctuary signifies His role as the ultimate intercessor and high priest.|
|HEB 9:25|Nor did He enter heaven to offer Himself repeatedly, as the high priest enters the Most Holy Place every year with blood not his own.|This verse emphasizes the singularity of Christ's sacrifice compared to the repeated sacrifices of the high priest, highlighting His unique role and the effectiveness of His atonement. The imagery draws a parallel to the yearly entry of the high priest into the Holy of Holies, underscoring that Christ's sacrifice was not merely a ritual act but a definitive offering for sin.|
|HEB 9:26|For then He would have had to suffer repeatedly since the foundation of the world; but now, at the conclusion of the ages, He has appeared once for all to put away sin by the sacrifice of Himself.|In this verse, the emphasis is placed on the singular, all-sufficient sacrifice of Christ, contrasting it with the repetitive sacrifices of the Old Testament. The phrase 'once for all' indicates the finality and completeness of Christ's atonement for sin.|
|HEB 9:27|And just as it is appointed for men to die once, and after that comes judgment,|This verse emphasizes the inevitability of death and the certainty of judgment that follows, reflecting a key theological concept in Christian eschatology. The word 'apokrite' (judgment) is vital as it introduces the notion of accountability after death, which is also echoed in the related verses cited.|
|HEB 9:28|So Christ was offered once to bear the sins of many; He will appear a second time, not to deal with sin but to bring salvation to those who are eagerly waiting for Him.|In this verse, the author of Hebrews highlights the singular and all-encompassing sacrifice of Christ, contrasting it with the repeated offerings of the Levitical priesthood. The phrase 'for the many' indicates the universal scope of His redemptive work. The term 'appear' suggests His second coming, emphasizing that this event is distinct from His first coming. The words 'awaiting Him' express the active hope and expectation of believers regarding salvation.|
