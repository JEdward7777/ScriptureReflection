| Reference | Verse | Translation Notes |
|:---------:|-------|-------------------|
|HEB 6:1|Therefore, let us leave behind the elementary teachings about Christ and press on to maturity, not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works and of faith toward God.|This verse emphasizes the importance of spiritual growth and maturity, urging believers to move beyond the basic teachings of Christ and to strive for completeness in their faith. The imagery of moving away from foundational teachings relates closely to the idea of progressing in one's spiritual journey, which is reinforced by the use of words like 'maturity' and 'perfection'.|
|HEB 6:2|of the teachings about baptisms, the laying on of hands, the resurrection of the dead, and eternal judgment.|This verse references several foundational Christian teachings and practices, emphasizing the significance of baptism, the laying on of hands, resurrection, and eternal judgment. It highlights the move from basic teachings to a deeper understanding of faith.|
|HEB 6:3|And this we will do, if God permits.|The phrase 'if God permits' reflects the biblical theme of dependence on God's will. It underscores the belief that human plans are subject to divine sovereignty.|
|HEB 6:4|For it is impossible for those who were once enlightened, who have tasted the heavenly gift, and who have become partakers of the Holy Spirit.|This translation seeks to capture the depth of the original Greek, emphasizing the spiritual enlightenment and divine gifts received by believers. The terms 'enlightened', 'tasted', 'heavenly gift', and 'partakers of the Holy Spirit' are preserved to reflect their theological significance in the context of salvation and the community of faith.|
|HEB 6:5|and have tasted the goodness of the word of God and the powers of the coming age.|In this translation, I aimed to capture the essence of the original Greek text while ensuring clarity and theological accuracy. The phrase 'tasted' signifies a deep experiential knowledge, akin to that expressed in Psalm 34:8. 'The powers of the age to come' refers to the miraculous manifestations of God's kingdom, which are foreshadowed in the present.|
|HEB 6:6|and if they fall away, it is impossible to renew them again to repentance, since they are crucifying the Son of God all over again and exposing him to public disgrace.|This translation emphasizes the concept of renewal and repentance as central themes, while accurately reflecting the warning conveyed in the original Greek text about the gravity of falling away after knowing the truth of Christ.|
|HEB 6:7|For land that drinks in the rain falling on it repeatedly and produces a crop useful to those for whom it is cultivated receives the blessing of God.|This verse uses agricultural imagery to depict how the earth receives rain and yields vegetation. The 'earth' is symbolic of those who receive God's blessings and produce good fruit. The terms used for 'rain' and 'blessing' emphasize the generosity of God towards those who are fruitful in their faith and works.|
|HEB 6:8|But if it produces thorns and thistles, it is worthless and near to being cursed, and its end is to be burned.|In this translation, the emphasis is on the metaphorical representation of land producing thorns and thistles, indicating unfruitfulness and judgment. The terms ‘ἀκάνθας’ (thorns) and ‘τριβόλους’ (thistles) are used metaphorically to illustrate the consequences of a life that does not yield good fruit, signifying the severity of divine judgment. The phrase 'ἀδόκιμος' (unworthy) and 'κατάρας' (curse) emphasize the proximity of judgment and condemnation, culminating in the phrase ‘ἧς τὸ τέλος εἰς καῦσιν’ (whose end is to be burned), which speaks of ultimate destruction for those unproductive in faith and deeds.|
|HEB 6:9|But beloved, we are convinced of better things concerning you, things that accompany salvation, even though we speak in this way.|This verse expresses a sense of assurance regarding the believers' state, emphasizing their position as loved ones and highlighting the expectation of better things in terms of salvation. The use of 'better' ('κρείττονα') implies a hopefulness and a positive outlook based on the foundational truths of faith in Christ.|
|HEB 6:10|For God is not unjust to forget your work and the love you have shown toward His name, in that you have ministered to the saints and continue to do so.|This translation emphasizes God's faithfulness in remembering the labor of love exhibited by believers. The original Greek highlights the concepts of work, love, and service, indicating that God acknowledges our efforts for His name and for others.|
|HEB 6:11|But we earnestly desire that each of you show the same steadfast effort to the full assurance of hope until the end.|In this translation, I emphasize the desire for steadfastness and perseverance in hope, reflecting the author's intent to encourage the readers. The phrase 'diligence' has been translated as 'steadfast effort,' underscoring the active pursuit of hope.|
|HEB 6:12|so that you may not become sluggish, but imitators of those who through faith and patience inherit the promises.|The phrase 'become sluggish' conveys a sense of laziness or indifference, contrasting with the encouragement to imitate those who inherit promises through faith and patience. 'Inherit' refers to receiving God's promises as part of one's spiritual heritage, highlighting the theme of perseverance in faith.|
|HEB 6:13|For when God made a promise to Abraham, since He could swear by no one greater, He swore by Himself.|The original Greek text highlights God's oath to Abraham, emphasizing that God swore by Himself since there was no one greater. This reflects the divine assurance given to Abraham regarding His promises. In translating this, I've focused on maintaining the integrity of the promise and the solemnity of God's oath.|
|HEB 6:14|saying, 'Surely I will bless you and multiply you.'|In this verse, the Greek terms 'εὐλογῶν' (blessing) and 'πληθύνων' (multiplying) highlight God's commitment to blessing and multiplying His people, echoing themes from the Abrahamic covenant.|
|HEB 6:15|And thus, having patiently endured, he obtained the promise.|In this verse, the idea of patience and the fulfillment of God's promise are central themes. The term 'μακροθυμήσας' implies a sense of long-suffering and perseverance, leading to the realization of God's promise.|
|HEB 6:16|For men indeed swear by a greater authority, and an oath serves as a confirmation to end all dispute.|In this verse, the emphasis is on the practice of swearing oaths by a greater authority to provide assurance against dispute. This custom is reflected in the structure of legal testimony in ancient societies. The term 'greater' refers to the authority and reliability of the one by whom the oath is taken, in contrast to human promises, which can be less certain.|
|HEB 6:17|Thus, in His desire to demonstrate more clearly to the heirs of the promise the unchangeable nature of His will, God intervened with an oath.|The verse emphasizes God's determination to show the unchangeable nature of His purpose through an oath. The choice of words reflects a strong assurance and divine commitment, aligning with the characteristics of God's promises found throughout Scripture.|
|HEB 6:18|so that by two unchangeable things, in which it is impossible for God to lie, we might have strong encouragement, we who have fled for refuge to lay hold of the hope set before us.|This verse emphasizes the steadfastness of God's promises and His unchangeable nature, reassuring believers of the hope they have through Him.|
|HEB 6:19|This hope we have as an anchor for the soul, both secure and steadfast, and which enters the inner sanctuary behind the curtain.|This translation emphasizes the metaphor of hope as an anchor, drawing from nautical imagery common in the culture, while ensuring clarity and theological accuracy based on the context of the surrounding verses.|
|HEB 6:20|Where Jesus has entered as a forerunner on our behalf, having become a high priest forever according to the order of Melchizedek.|In this verse, the imagery of Jesus as a forerunner emphasizes His unique role as both high priest and the one who leads us into the presence of God. The reference to Melchizedek highlights the eternal priesthood of Jesus, signifying a divine order that surpasses the Levitical priesthood. The Greek word 'πρόδρομος' (forerunner) indicates someone who goes ahead to prepare the way for others, which speaks to Christ's role in our salvation and access to God.|
