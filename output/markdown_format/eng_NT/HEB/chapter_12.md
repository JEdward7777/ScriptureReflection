The tone is paternal, reflecting a loving father’s desire to instruct his children. The Greek term 'παρακλήσεως' (paraklēsis) can refer to both encouragement and comfort, highlighting the multifaceted nature of God’s dealings with us, particularly in the face of challenges.|
|HEB 12:6|For the Lord disciplines those He loves, and He punishes every son whom He accepts.|This verse emphasizes the connection between God's love and His discipline, indicating that the discipline is a sign of acceptance and care, much like the nurturing actions of a loving father toward his child. The wording has been crafted to maintain the original message while presenting it in a contemporary English style.|
|HEB 12:7|If you endure discipline, God is treating you as sons. For what son is not disciplined by his father?|In this verse, the concept of discipline as a form of love and acceptance from God is emphasized. The term 'discipline' (παιδεία) refers to both corrective action and the nurturing guidance that leads to growth. The reference to 'son' signifies a close and personal relationship with God, reinforcing that such discipline is part of being recognized as His children.|
|HEB 12:8|If you are without discipline, in which all have shared, then you are illegitimate children and not true sons.|The term 'without discipline' indicates a lack of rightful training and nurturing that is inherent in being a child of God. The implication of being 'bastards' emphasizes the seriousness of not being recognized as legitimate heirs due to the absence of God’s guiding hand through discipline.|

|HEB 12:11|Now, no discipline seems pleasant at the moment, but rather painful; yet afterward it yields the peaceful fruit of righteousness to those who have been trained by it.|This verse discusses the nature of discipline and its immediate and long-term effects.

The terms 'fornicator' and 'profane' are chosen for their clarity and adherence to traditional theological definitions, conveying a serious warning about spiritual negligence.|
|HEB 12:17|For you know that afterward, when he desired to inherit the blessing, he was rejected, for he found no opportunity for repentance, though he sought it with tears.|This translation aims to capture the intensity of Esau's regret and the irrevocable nature of his decision.

|HEB 12:18|For you have not come to a mountain that can be touched and that is burning with fire; to darkness, gloom, and tempest.|The verse emphasizes the contrast between the physical mountain at Sinai, which was tangible and fearsome, and the spiritual mountain to which believers have come, which is far superior.

|HEB 12:19|And the sound of the trumpet and the voice of words, which those who heard it begged that no further word should be spoken to them.|This verse emphasizes the overwhelming experience of hearing God's voice and the fear it instilled in the Israelites at Mount Sinai.

The phrase 'ἔκφοβός εἰμι καὶ ἔντρομος' suggests a profound sense of terror and respect, highlighting Moses' reaction to God's manifestation.|
|HEB 12:22|But you have come to Mount Zion, the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, and to countless angels in joyful assembly.|In this verse, the author emphasizes the contrast between the terrifying experience of Mount Sinai (previous verse) and the joyous assembly at Mount Zion. The terms 'Zion', 'living God', 'heavenly Jerusalem', and 'myriads of angels' are significant in understanding the heavenly and communal aspect of the believers' relationship with God.|
|HEB 12:23|To the joyful assembly and congregation of the firstborn, whose names are registered in heaven, and to God the judge of all, and to the spirits of the righteous who have been made perfect.|This verse emphasizes the assembly of the firstborn and the concept of being registered in heaven, contrasting with earthly gatherings. The term 'firstborn' reflects the inheritance and honor given to those in Christ. 'God the judge of all' stresses His sovereignty and authority, while 'spirits of the righteous made perfect' highlights the completed work of salvation in believers.|
|HEB 12:24|and to Jesus, the mediator of a new covenant, and to the blood of sprinkling that speaks better things than that of Abel.|The phrase 'the blood of sprinkling' refers to the ceremonial use of blood in sacrifices, indicating a purifying and covenantal significance. The contrast with Abel highlights the greater significance of Christ's sacrifice compared to the sacrifice of Abel, which calls for justice.|

For if they did not escape who refused him who spoke on earth, much more shall we not escape if we turn away from Him who speaks from heaven.|This verse emphasizes the importance of listening to God’s voice and the grave consequences of turning away from His guidance. The Greek term 'παραιτήσησθε' (to refuse) indicates a rejection or a deliberate choice to turn away, which should be taken seriously, especially in light of the examples of past disobedience. The contrast between the earthly voice and the heavenly one underscores the urgency to heed the divine call.|
|HEB 12:26|Whose voice then shook the earth; but now He has promised, saying, 'Yet once more I will shake not only the earth, but also heaven.'|In this verse, the imagery of shaking both the earth and heaven underscores God's sovereignty and the impending changes in creation. The phrase 'once more' emphasizes a final act of divine authority, which is consistent with the theme of transformation found throughout Hebrews. The translation captures the original Greek emphasis on the voice of God and His power to shake creation.|
|HEB 12:27|This phrase, 'Yet once more,' indicates the removal of things that are shaken, as of things that have been made, in order that what cannot be shaken may remain.|The phrase 'Yet once more' emphasizes the notion of divine intervention and transformation, indicating that the shaking refers to a divine act that results in a discernible change. The terms used relate to what can be shaken, emphasizing the impermanent nature of the created order in contrast to the eternal and unshakeable reality of God's kingdom.|
|HEB 12:28|Therefore, receiving a kingdom that cannot be shaken, let us be thankful, and so worship God acceptably with reverence and awe.|In this translation, emphasis is placed on the unshakeable nature of God's kingdom and the appropriate reverence and gratitude that believers should express in their worship. The terms 'grace,' 'serve,' and 'reverence' reflect core themes in the New Testament, highlighting a believer's response to God's eternal kingdom.|
|HEB 12:29|For our God is a consuming fire.|The phrase 'πῦρ καταναλίσκον' translates directly as 'a consuming fire.' In this context, it emphasizes God's nature as both powerful and purifying.
