| Reference | Verse | Translation Notes |
|:---------:|-------|-------------------|
|HEB 4:1|Therefore, let us fear, lest any of you should seem to have come short of entering into His rest.|This verse warns believers to take heed and not miss the opportunity of entering into God's rest, which is a key theme throughout the Book of Hebrews, particularly emphasizing faith and the danger of unbelief.|
|HEB 4:2|For indeed we have been given good news, just as they were; but the message they heard did not benefit them, because it was not mixed with faith in those who listened.|This verse emphasizes the critical role of faith in receiving the message of the gospel. The original Greek highlights the contrast between those who hear the message and those who truly believe it. The use of 'λόγος' (word) and 'πίστις' (faith) points to the necessity of not just listening but also integrating that word into one’s belief system to experience its benefits.|
|HEB 4:3|For we who have believed enter that rest, as He has said, ‘As I swore in my wrath, they shall not enter my rest,’ although His works were finished from the foundation of the world.|The verse emphasizes the connection between faith and entering God's rest, echoing the concept found in the Old Testament of the Sabbath rest and the consequences of disbelief.|
|HEB 4:4|For He has somewhere spoken of the seventh day in this way: 'And God rested on the seventh day from all His works.'|The phrase 'on the seventh day' reflects a significant theological concept of rest and completion found in the Genesis account. The word for 'rest' (κατέπαυσεν) denotes both cessation from work and a state of tranquility that God entered into. The text emphasizes God's sovereign authority and the culmination of His creative acts.|
|HEB 4:5|And again, He says, 'They shall not enter into My rest.'|This verse emphasizes the promise of entering into God's rest, highlighting the urgency of heeding the warning against disobedience. The original phrase indicates a reiteration of the invitation to rest, drawing from the rich biblical theme of God's rest after creation and the spiritual rest He offers to believers.|
|HEB 4:6|Since then, it remains for some to enter into that rest, and those who were formerly given the good news did not enter because of their disobedience.|This verse emphasizes the urgency of faith and obedience, underscoring the tragic fate of those who, despite hearing the good news, failed to enter into God's promised rest due to their unbelief. The use of 'some' indicates a portion of those invited to enter are left outside because of their rebellion.|
|HEB 4:7|Again he appoints a certain day, ‘Today,’ saying through David, after so long a time, as it has been said: ‘Today, if you hear his voice, do not harden your hearts.'|The phrase 'Today' emphasizes the urgency of responding to God's voice, reflecting the broader biblical theme of the present moment as a time for repentance and openness to divine guidance. The mention of David highlights the continuity of God's message through scripture and the importance of not hardening one’s heart to His call.|
|HEB 4:8|For if Jesus had given them rest, he would not have spoken later of another day.|In this verse, the author contrasts the rest that Jesus offers with the earlier rest experienced by the Israelites. It indicates that if Jesus had provided complete rest, there would not be a continuing offer of another day of rest.|
|HEB 4:9|So then, a Sabbath rest remains for the people of God.|This verse emphasizes the concept of a Sabbath rest that remains for the people of God, echoing the theme of rest found in the previous context of Hebrews 4. The term 'σαββατισμὸς' signifies a special kind of rest, reflecting the fulfillment of God's promise of rest for His people.|
|HEB 4:10|For the one who has entered His rest has also ceased from his own works, just as God did from His.|The term 'rest' in this verse emphasizes a cessation from labor and a state of divine tranquility, paralleling God's own rest after creation. The phrase 'His own works' signifies a personal relationship to one's labor, linking the believer's experience to God's original pattern of rest.|
|HEB 4:11|Let us therefore be diligent to enter that rest, so that no one will fall by following the same example of disobedience.|The Greek word 'σπουδάσωμεν' (let us strive) implies a sense of urgency and dedication to entering into rest, contrasting with the danger of falling into disobedience. The phrase 'κατάπαυσιν' signifies a state of rest that is to be earnestly sought after.|
|HEB 4:12|For the word of God is alive and active, sharper than any double-edged sword, penetrating to the division of soul and spirit, joints and marrow, and discerning the thoughts and intentions of the heart.|This translation seeks to convey the active and penetrating nature of God's Word, emphasizing its ability to discern the inner workings of the heart and spirit. The phrase 'two-edged sword' has been interpreted to mean that it cuts through the most profound divisions of human existence, illustrating its power in both judgment and discernment.|
|HEB 4:13|And no creature is hidden from His sight, but all things are naked and exposed to the eyes of Him to whom we must give account.|In this verse, the Greek word 'ἀφανὴς' (aphanes) is translated as 'hidden,' emphasizing the omniscience of God. The phrase 'everything is naked and exposed' captures the imagery of vulnerability before God's discerning gaze. The reference to 'the word' highlights the previous context of God’s word as an agent of judgment and insight.|
|HEB 4:14|Therefore, since we have a great high priest who has ascended into heaven, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold firmly to the faith we profess.|The term 'great high priest' emphasizes the unique and supreme role of Jesus in the priesthood, contrasting the earthly priests. The phrase 'who has passed through the heavens' reflects Jesus' ascension and his unique position as both divine and human, providing a direct connection between God and humanity. The call to 'hold fast our confession' highlights the importance of steadfast faith in Jesus, especially in light of the previous verse's emphasis on God's all-seeing nature.|
|HEB 4:15|For we do not have a high priest who is unable to empathize with our weaknesses, but one who has been tested in every way, just as we are—yet he did not sin.|The Greek term 'συμπαθῆσαι' reflects empathy and compassion, suggesting that Jesus, our High Priest, not only understands our weaknesses but shares in our experience of humanity. This is contrasted with the concept of sinlessness, which is pivotal in Christian doctrine as it underscores the unique qualification of Christ as our mediator.|
|HEB 4:16|Let us then approach the throne of grace with boldness, that we may receive mercy and find grace to help in our time of need.|This translation emphasizes the invitation to approach God confidently, highlighting the themes of grace and help. The terms 'grace' and 'mercy' reflect the source text's focus on God's character as welcoming and supportive for believers seeking aid.|
