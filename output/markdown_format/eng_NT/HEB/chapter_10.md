| Reference | Verse | Translation Notes |
|:---------:|-------|-------------------|
|HEB 10:1|For the Law, having a shadow of the good things to come and not the very image of those things, can never, through the same sacrifices offered continually year after year, make perfect those who draw near.|This translation focuses on the contrast between the temporary nature of the Old Covenant sacrifices and the finality of Christ's sacrifice. The term 'shadow' is used to emphasize the Law's inability to achieve true perfection, highlighting the thematic continuity found in Hebrews regarding the transition from the Old to the New Covenant.|
|HEB 10:2|For if they had been able to make the worshipers completely free from guilt, they would have ceased being offered, since the worshipers would no longer have any awareness of sin.|In this verse, the focus is on the insufficiency of the sacrificial system to truly cleanse the worshipers from sin, highlighting the need for a more perfect sacrifice that has already been accomplished in Christ. The phrase 'consciousness of sins' is translated as 'the awareness of sin', emphasizing the burden of sin that remains without true atonement.|
|HEB 10:3|But in those sacrifices, there is a continual reminder of sins year after year.|In this verse, the term 'remembrance' (ἀνάμνησις) indicates that the sacrifices serve as a continual reminder of sin. This reflects the theme of the inability of the old covenant sacrifices to ultimately deal with sin, which is prevalent throughout Hebrews.|
|HEB 10:4|For it is impossible for the blood of bulls and goats to take away sins.|This verse underscores the insufficiency of animal sacrifices in addressing sin, indicating that they cannot take away sins. The terms 'blood' and 'sacrifices' are integral to the understanding of atonement in the Old Testament and point to the need for a more perfect sacrifice, which is fulfilled in Christ.|
|HEB 10:5|Therefore, when he comes into the world, he says: ‘Sacrifice and offering you did not desire, but a body you have prepared for me.’|This verse reflects the prophetic understanding of God's will regarding sacrifice, emphasizing the sufficiency of Christ's body as the ultimate sacrifice, contrasting the ritual offerings of the Old Testament. The use of 'body' (σῶμα) points to the incarnation and the significance of Jesus's physical sacrifice.|
|HEB 10:6|In whole burnt offerings and sacrifices for sin you took no pleasure.|This verse emphasizes the lack of God's desire for sacrificial offerings as a means of atonement for sin, highlighting the need for a deeper commitment and a true heart in obedience rather than mere ritualism. The translation maintains the meaning from the original Greek text, conveying the theological implications related to the sufficiency of Christ's sacrifice over the old covenant practices.|
|HEB 10:7|Then I said, ‘Behold, I have come; in the scroll of the book it is written of me, to do your will, O God.’|The verse emphasizes the idea that God's will and intent were established before the sacrifices, highlighting a deeper spiritual obedience over ritualistic offerings. This reflects the continuity of thought from the Old Testament into the New Testament, affirming God's desire for a relationship rather than mere sacrifice.|
|HEB 10:8|When He said above, ‘Sacrifices and offerings, and burnt offerings and sin offerings, You did not desire, nor did You take pleasure in them’—these are offered according to the Law.|This verse highlights the rejection of ritualistic sacrifices as sufficient for atonement, emphasizing God's desire for obedience over ceremonial offerings. The phrase 'you did not desire' reflects a common theme in Scripture that critiques the effectiveness of ritual without true devotion.|
|HEB 10:9|Then He said, ‘Behold, I have come to do Your will, O God.’ He takes away the first covenant to establish the second.|This verse emphasizes the transition from the old sacrificial system to the fulfillment of God's will through Christ. The phrases ‘to do Your will’ and ‘He takes away the first’ highlight the new covenant established by Jesus, contrasting with the former practices that God did not desire.|
|HEB 10:10|By this divine will, we are made holy through the single offering of the body of Jesus Christ.|In this verse, the emphasis is on the will of God and the definitive action taken through Jesus Christ's offering. The term 'sanctified' is pivotal, signifying that believers are made holy and set apart through the sacrifice of Christ, and the phrase 'once for all' underscores the sufficiency and finality of His sacrifice.|
|HEB 10:11|And every priest stands daily at his service, offering repeatedly the same sacrifices, which can never take away sins.|In this verse, the contrast is drawn between the continual offerings made by the priests and the finality of Christ's singular sacrifice. The Greek term for 'priest' (ἱερεὺς) emphasizes the mediatorial role of the priest in the sacrificial system. The phrase 'offering many times' relates to the repetitive nature of the Old Testament sacrifices, which were unable to fully address the issue of sin (inability to take away sins). This translation aims to reflect both the theological significance of Christ's sacrifice and the futility of the former sacrificial system.|
|HEB 10:12|But when Christ had offered for all time a single sacrifice for sins, he sat down at the right hand of God.|This verse highlights the uniqueness and sufficiency of Christ's sacrifice, contrasting it with the repeated sacrifices of the Old Testament priests. It emphasizes that, unlike those priests who were constantly offering sacrifices, Christ's one offering was perfect and sufficient, allowing Him to take His place of honor at God's right hand, a position of authority and rest after His redemptive work.|
|HEB 10:13|He is now waiting expectantly until his enemies are made a footstool under his feet.|This verse emphasizes the waiting period for Christ until his enemies are finally subdued. The word 'εκδεχόμενος' suggests an active anticipation or expectation, which reflects Christ's current reign as He awaits the complete victory over his foes. The phrase 'ὑποπόδιον τῶν ποδῶν αὐτοῦ' highlights the concept of his enemies being made a footstool, an imagery drawn from Psalm 110, indicating total subjugation.|
|HEB 10:14|For by a single offering, He has perfected for all time those who are being sanctified.|The phrase 'τετελείωκεν' (perfected) conveys a sense of completion and finality regarding the sanctification of those who are being made holy. It implies a single, definitive act rather than a repeated action, emphasizing the sufficiency of Christ's sacrifice. The term 'γὰρ προσφορᾷ' (for one offering) suggests that it is through this singular act of offering that believers are sanctified for all time, indicating a contrast to the Old Testament sacrificial system.|
|HEB 10:15|And the Holy Spirit also bears witness to us; for after saying these things,|The phrase 'the Holy Spirit' in this verse indicates the active role of the Spirit in affirming God's covenant and witness to believers. This reflects the ongoing testimony of the Spirit in the lives of the faithful, consistent with the theme of divine assurance found throughout Scripture.|
|HEB 10:16|This is the covenant that I will make with them after those days, says the Lord: I will place my laws upon their hearts, and on their minds, I will write them.|In this verse, the Lord expresses His promise of a new covenant, emphasizing internal transformation rather than mere external adherence to laws. The terms 'heart' and 'mind' indicate a deep, personal relationship and commitment that transcends ritual observance.|
|HEB 10:17|And their sins and their lawless deeds I will remember no more.|This verse emphasizes God's promise of complete forgiveness and the divine act of forgetting past sins.

The use of 'Ἁγίων' highlights the sacredness of the presence being entered, which is foundational to understanding the privilege afforded to believers. The term 'αἵματι τοῦ Ἰησοῦ' stresses the importance of Christ's blood as the means of this access, connecting back to themes of atonement and redemption.|
|HEB 10:20|which He inaugurated for us, a new and living way, through the curtain, that is, His flesh.|In this verse, the concept of a 'new and living way' highlights the fresh covenant brought by Christ's sacrifice, emphasizing the transformative access believers have through His flesh as the new veil, allowing direct communion with God.|
|HEB 10:21|And since we have a great priest over the house of God,|The phrase 'great priest' emphasizes the superiority and the role of Jesus as the ultimate mediator between God and humanity. The 'house of God' refers to His divine presence and spiritual community, highlighting the importance of Christ's priesthood in establishing a relationship with God.|
|HEB 10:22|Let us draw near with a true heart, in full assurance of faith, having our hearts sprinkled clean from an evil conscience and our bodies washed with pure water.|This translation focuses on the themes of approaching God with sincerity and faith, as well as the purification of our hearts and conscience, which reflects the original intent of the text.|
|HEB 10:23|Let us hold unswervingly to the confession of our hope, for He who promised is faithful.|This verse emphasizes the importance of holding firmly to our confession of hope in light of God’s faithfulness.

The structure parallels the earlier verses focusing on the internal transformation and external expression of faith.|
|HEB 10:24|And let us consider how to stir up one another to love and good works.|The original Greek phrase 'κατανοῶμεν ἀλλήλους' emphasizes mutual observance or consideration among believers. The term 'παροξυσμὸν ἀγάπης καὶ καλῶν ἔργων' signifies a stirring up or provocation towards love and good deeds. This reflects an active, communal encouragement in faith and service.|
|HEB 10:25|not neglecting to meet together, as is the habit of some, but encouraging one another, and all the more as you see the Day drawing near.|In this verse, the emphasis is on the importance of gathering together as believers, countering the tendency to forsake communal worship. The term 'ἐπισυναγωγὴν' refers to the assembly or gathering of Christians, highlighting the communal aspect of faith. The exhortation to 'encourage' (παρακλοῦντες) one another indicates an active role believers have in each other's lives, especially as they see the day approaching, which refers to the return of Christ.|
|HEB 10:26|For if we deliberately continue to sin after receiving the knowledge of the truth, there no longer remains a sacrifice for sins.|This verse emphasizes the seriousness of willful sin after receiving the knowledge of the truth, indicating a point of no return concerning sacrifice for sins. It serves as a solemn warning to believers about the repercussions of deliberate transgressions after acknowledging the truth of God's revelation through Christ.|
|HEB 10:27|But a fearful expectation of judgment, and a fiery zeal that will consume those who stand against Him.|This translation emphasizes the severity of the consequences for rejecting God's truth and the intensity of divine judgment as depicted in the original Greek. The terms 'fearful' and 'fury' highlight the impending judgment that awaits those who oppose God, aligning with the thematic context of Hebrews regarding apostasy.|
|HEB 10:28|Anyone who disregards the law of Moses dies without mercy on the testimony of two or three witnesses.|In this verse, the context focuses on the severity of rejecting God's law, highlighting the established principle of requiring multiple witnesses to substantiate a charge.

|HEB 10:29|How much worse punishment do you think will be deserved by one who has trampled underfoot the Son of God, and has treated as common the blood of the covenant by which he was sanctified, and has outraged the Spirit of grace?|This translation emphasizes the seriousness of contempt toward the Son of God and the blood of the covenant.

|HEB 10:30|For we know the one who said, 'Vengeance is mine; I will repay,' and again, 'The Lord will judge His people.'|This verse emphasizes God's role as the ultimate judge and the one who enacts justice. It highlights the assurance that God will hold accountable those who wrong His people. The translation preserves the authority of God's judgment as stated in the original Greek.|
|HEB 10:31|It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.|This verse emphasizes the serious nature of falling into the hands of the living God, contrasting His holiness with human sinfulness. The use of 'fearful' captures the essence of dread and reverence toward God's judgment.|

The mention of 'former days' suggests a call to remember past challenges and victories in faith.|
|HEB 10:33|Partly by being made a spectacle, both by reproaches and tribulations; and partly by becoming companions of those who were so treated.|This verse captures the experience of believers who were subjected to public shame and suffering, while also associating with those who endured similar trials.

The translation emphasizes the dual aspect of being a spectator of others' suffering and actively participating in it, enhancing the sense of community in trials.|
|HEB 10:34|For you showed sympathy to my chains and joyfully accepted the plundering of your property, knowing that you have a better possession and an enduring one in heaven.|This verse reflects the theme of suffering for the faith and the hope of eternal rewards. The mention of being in chains (δεσμοῖς) and the joy (χαρᾶς) found in accepting the confiscation of property (ἁρπαγὴν τῶν ὑπαρχόντων) conveys a deep commitment to Christ, who is the source of better possessions in heaven (κρείττονα ὕπαρξιν ἐν οὐρανοῖς).|
|HEB 10:35|Therefore, do not throw away your confidence, which carries a great reward.|The term 'παρρησία' (parrhesia) refers to boldness or confidence in speech, which is crucial in the context of faith and perseverance.
