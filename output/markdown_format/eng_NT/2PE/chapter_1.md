|:---------:|-------|-------------------|
|2PE 1:1|Simon Peter, a servant and apostle of Jesus Christ, to those who have obtained a faith of equal standing with ours through the righteousness of our God and Savior, Jesus Christ.|The term 'συμεὼν' refers specifically to Simon Peter, who identifies himself with the titles of 'slave' and 'apostle.' The phrase 'ἰσότιμον ἡμῖν λαχοῦσι πίστιν' emphasizes the equal privilege of faith shared among believers, which is grounded in the righteousness of God and Jesus Christ, affirming both their divine authority and our shared relationship through faith.|
|2PE 1:2|May grace and peace be multiplied to you in the knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord.|The original Greek emphasizes a desire for an abundance of grace and peace that comes through knowledge of God and Jesus Christ. The terms 'grace' and 'peace' are common greetings in Pauline epistles, reflecting the overall message of God’s favor and tranquility among believers. The phrase 'in the knowledge' is particularly important, indicating that the increase in grace and peace is directly related to one's understanding of God and Jesus.|
|2PE 1:3|His divine power has granted to us all things that pertain to life and godliness, through the knowledge of him who called us to his own glory and excellence.|In this translation, I've focused on conveying the fullness of life and godliness that is imparted through the knowledge of God. The phrases 'life' and 'godliness' were emphasized, reflecting their foundational significance in Christian faith and practice.|
|2PE 1:4|Through these, He has granted to us His most precious and magnificent promises, so that through them you may become partakers of the divine nature, having escaped from the corruption that is in the world because of sinful desire.|This verse emphasizes the gifts given to believers, highlighting the significance of the 'exceedingly great and precious promises' that lead to participation in the divine nature. The use of 'exceedingly great' captures the overwhelming generosity of God's promises, while 'partakers of the divine nature' stresses the transformation and sanctification that occurs in the life of a believer, escaping the corruption of worldly desires.|
|2PE 1:5|For this very reason, make every effort to supplement your faith with virtue, and virtue with knowledge,|This translation emphasizes the necessity of diligence and active participation in cultivating virtues stemming from faith. The Greek word 'σπουδὴν' conveys a sense of earnestness and zeal, reflecting the importance of a committed approach to growing in spiritual attributes.|
|2PE 1:6|and in knowledge, self-control; and in self-control, endurance; and in endurance, godliness;|This verse emphasizes the progression of virtues and qualities in the believer's life, indicating that knowledge leads to self-control, which in turn fosters endurance and ultimately leads to godliness. The term 'self-control' here (ἐγκράτεια) is reflective of discipline and mastery over one's desires and impulses, which is further tied to the virtue of endurance (ὑπομονή).|
|2PE 1:7|and in godliness, brotherly love; and in brotherly love, love.|The Greek word 'φιλαδελφία' denotes a brotherly love, emphasizing affection among fellow believers, while 'ἀγάπη' refers to a deeper, unconditional love. This translation aims to capture the essence of both terms in a manner that reflects the importance of these virtues in Christian fellowship.|
|2PE 1:8|For if these qualities are yours and abound, they will keep you from being ineffective and unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ.|This verse emphasizes the importance of possessing and increasing certain virtues that prevent spiritual stagnation and ensure effectiveness in knowing the Lord. The terms used relate closely to action and the resulting characteristics that reflect one's faith in Christ.|
|2PE 1:9|For whoever lacks these qualities is blind, having forgotten the purification from their former sins.|The phrase 'mighty has forgotten' indicates a lack of awareness or insight into one's past wrongdoings, highlighting a spiritual blindness that results from not practicing the virtues mentioned previously. The imagery of blindness and forgetting draws upon common biblical themes of enlightenment versus ignorance.|
|2PE 1:10|Therefore, brothers, be all the more diligent to confirm your calling and election; for if you practice these qualities, you will never stumble.|In this verse, Peter emphasizes the importance of diligence in confirming one's calling and election. The terms 'calling' and 'election' indicate God's sovereign choice, while 'diligence' speaks to human responsibility in responding to that call. This balance is crucial in Christian doctrine.|
|2PE 1:11|For in this way, an abundant welcome will be provided for you into the eternal kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.|In this verse, the word 'plentifully' emphasizes the generous nature of God's provision. The phrase 'entrance into' signifies not just entry but a warm welcome into the eternal kingdom, and it directly connects the believer's life to Christ's sovereignty and salvation. The use of 'Lord and Savior' captures both the authority and the intimate relationship we have with Christ.|
|2PE 1:12|Therefore, I will always be ready to remind you of these things, even though you already know them and are firmly established in the truth that you now hold.|The verse emphasizes the importance of continual reminder and the establishment of the recipients in the truth they already possess. It reflects Peter's pastoral concern to reinforce and remind believers of foundational truths despite their prior knowledge.|
|2PE 1:13|But I consider it right, as long as I am in this tent, to awaken you by reminding you.|The phrase 'διεγείρειν ὑμᾶς ἐν ὑπομνήσει' can be understood as 'to awaken you in remembrance'. The term 'σκηνώματι' signifies 'this tent', metaphorically referring to the earthly body. This reflects Peter's desire to stir up his readers to remember essential truths before his passing.|
|2PE 1:14|knowing that my departure from this earthly tent is imminent, as our Lord Jesus Christ has made clear to me.|In this verse, Peter speaks of the imminent end of his earthly life, referring to it metaphorically as the 'tent' of his body. The reference to the Lord Jesus Christ indicating this departure underscores the significance of his impending passing. This fresh translation seeks to maintain the clarity of the original Greek while making it accessible and poignant for contemporary readers.|
|2PE 1:15|And I will make every effort to ensure that you can remember these things even after my departure.|The phrase 'after my departure' refers to Peter's impending death. 'To have you always remember' emphasizes the importance of remembrance in the Christian life. The word 'diligently' indicates a sense of urgency and commitment in Peter's intent to remind believers.|
|2PE 1:16|For we did not follow cleverly devised myths when we made known to you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but we were eyewitnesses of his majesty.|In this translation, the emphasis is on the authentic experience of the apostles as witnesses of Christ's power and glory, contrasting with fables or myths. The use of 'eye-witnesses' is to highlight their firsthand experience, aligning with the original Greek term 'ἐπόπται'.|
|2PE 1:17|For He received honor and glory from God the Father when the voice was borne to Him by the majestic glory, saying, 'This is my beloved Son, with whom I am well pleased.'|This verse emphasizes the divine honor and glory bestowed upon Jesus by the Father, specifically highlighting the significance of the voice from heaven declaring Jesus as the beloved Son. The use of terms like 'honor', 'glory', and the context of divine affirmation align with similar themes found in other New Testament passages that testify to Christ's identity and mission.|
|2PE 1:18|And we heard this voice borne from heaven while we were with Him on the holy mountain.|In this verse, Peter refers to a profound experience where he, along with others, directly hears the voice from heaven, affirming the divinity and approval of Jesus. This experience is significant for Peter's authority in teaching about Christ, as it underscores the eyewitness nature of his testimony.|
|2PE 1:19|And we have the more certain prophetic word, to which you do well to pay attention as to a lamp shining in a dark place, until the day dawns and the morning star rises in your hearts.|In this verse, the Apostle Peter emphasizes the certainty and reliability of the prophetic word. The metaphor of a light shining in a dark place illustrates the guidance and hope that the prophetic message brings until the dawn of a new day, symbolizing the return of Christ and the illumination of truth in believers' hearts.|
|2PE 1:20|First of all, understand this: No prophecy of Scripture comes from one’s own interpretation.|This translation emphasizes the idea that no prophecy of Scripture is a product of personal interpretation but is divinely inspired. The phrase 'private interpretation' has been translated as 'personal understanding' to reflect the original Greek nuance more clearly.|
|2PE 1:21|For no prophecy ever came by the will of man, but men moved by the Holy Spirit spoke from God.|This verse emphasizes that prophecy does not originate from human will but is inspired by the Holy Spirit, which underscores the divine authority and authenticity of the prophetic message.|
