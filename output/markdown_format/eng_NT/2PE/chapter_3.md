|2PE 3:1|This is now, beloved, the second letter I am writing to you, in which I am stirring up your sincere mind by way of reminder.|In this verse, the author expresses his intent to remind his audience of important truths through a second letter. The use of 'sincere mind' reflects the need for genuine understanding and awareness. The phrase 'to stir up' carries a similar connotation as found in other scriptures, where believers are encouraged to be active in their faith.|
|2PE 3:2|to remember the words spoken beforehand by the holy prophets and the commandment of your apostles of the Lord and Savior.|This verse emphasizes the importance of remembering the prophetic messages delivered by holy prophets and the commandments given by the apostles of Jesus Christ. It serves as a reminder to the recipients of Peter's letter to stay faithful to the teachings they have received, reinforcing the continuity of God's message through different periods of biblical history.|
|2PE 3:3|First of all, know this: In the last days, scoffers will come, following their own desires.|This verse highlights the emergence of scoffers in the last days, emphasizing their self-serving motivations and their dismissal of prophetic words. The term 'scoffers' conveys a sense of mockery, reflecting their contempt for divine truths.|
|2PE 3:4|And they will say, ‘Where is the promise of His coming? For since our forefathers fell asleep, all things continue as they were from the beginning of creation.’|In this verse, the scoffers question the promise of Christ's return, using the phrase 'where is the promise of His coming?' which reflects their doubt and disbelief. The word 'present' relates directly to the expectation of His return, while 'fathers' alludes to the continuity of faith and the testimony of previous generations. This translation aims to capture the skepticism expressed by the scoffers while maintaining a faithful representation of the original text.|
|2PE 3:5|For they deliberately overlook this fact: that long ago the heavens were formed, and the earth was established out of water and through water by the word of God.|In this verse, the emphasis is on the ignorance of those who willfully overlook God's past acts of creation. The language draws from the concepts of both the heavens and the earth being formed through God's will and command, highlighting the power of His word and the separation of elements in the creation narrative.|
|2PE 3:6|Through which the world that then existed was deluged with water and perished.|This verse refers to the destruction of the ancient world by the flood, emphasizing that the world at that time was overwhelmed by water, leading to its demise. The focus is on the power of God's word in both creation and destruction.|
|2PE 3:7|But the present heavens and the earth, by the same word, are stored up for fire, being kept for the day of judgment and the destruction of ungodly men.|The phrase 'the heavens and the earth' signifies the entirety of the created order, emphasizing its temporal nature. The term 'reserved' indicates a divine safeguarding for a future event, in this case, the day of judgment. The use of 'fire' connects to the theme of divine judgment, highlighting the severity of God's response to unrighteousness.|
|2PE 3:8|But do not let this one thing escape your notice, beloved, that with the Lord one day is as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day.|This verse emphasizes the timelessness of God compared to human understanding of time. The phrase 'one day' serves as a comparative expression illustrating God's perspective on time. This translation strives to convey the essence of the original Greek text, highlighting the contrast between divine time and human time.|
|2PE 3:9|The Lord is not delaying his promise, as some count delay, but is being patient with us, not wishing for any to perish but for all to come to repentance.|In this translation, I've emphasized God's character as patient and desiring repentance. The choice of 'delays' instead of 'is slow' highlights God's purposeful waiting rather than merely a lack of speed. The phrase 'for all to come to repentance' maintains the universality of God's desire for salvation.|
|2PE 3:10|But the day of the Lord will come like a thief in the night; in which the heavens will pass away with a great noise, and the elements will be burned up and dissolved, and the earth and the works that are in it will be burned up.|This verse emphasizes the suddenness and unexpected nature of the Day of the Lord, drawing imagery from both the concept of a thief coming in the night and the eventual destruction of the heavens and earth. The use of the term 'elements' reflects the fundamental aspects of creation that will be transformed or destroyed in the end times. The tone is both solemn and prophetic, warning of a future reality that calls for preparedness and faithfulness among believers.|
|2PE 3:11|Since all these things are to be dissolved, what sort of people ought you to be in lives of holiness and godliness?|In this verse, the emphasis is placed on the necessity of living a life that reflects holiness and godliness, particularly in light of the imminent destruction of the heavens and earth. The word 'conduct' (ἀναστροφαῖς) conveys the idea of daily behavior and lifestyle, aligning with the holiness and reverence (εὐσεβείαις) expected of believers.|
|2PE 3:12|waiting for and hastening the coming of the day of God, because of which the heavens will be set ablaze and the elements will melt in the fire!|This translation emphasizes the anticipation and urgency in awaiting the Day of the Lord, as well as the implications of that expectation on the believer's conduct. The use of terms like 'awaiting' and 'hastening' captures both the hopeful longing and the active role of believers in the context of eschatological expectation.|
|2PE 3:13|But according to His promise, we are waiting for new heavens and a new earth, in which righteousness dwells.|This translation emphasizes the anticipation of God's promise for a renewed creation, reflecting the themes found throughout Scripture concerning God's justice and righteousness in the coming age.|
|2PE 3:14|Therefore, beloved, since you are waiting for these things, be diligent to be found by Him without spot or blemish, and at peace.|In this verse, the call for believers to be found ‘spotless and blameless’ emphasizes the moral and spiritual purity expected of them as they await the fulfillment of God’s promises. The term 'peace' encapsulates a state of spiritual well-being and right relationship with God, aligning with the hope of salvation and the final judgment.|
|2PE 3:15|And consider the patience of our Lord as salvation, just as our beloved brother Paul also wrote to you according to the wisdom given to him.|The Greek term 'μακροθυμία' refers to God's patience or long-suffering, particularly in the context of His desire for all to come to repentance and salvation. The passage emphasizes that God's patience should be viewed as an opportunity for salvation rather than as a delay in judgment. This understanding connects to the teachings of the Apostle Paul, who often discussed themes of grace and the call to salvation.|
|2PE 3:16|as he does in all his letters when he speaks in them of these matters. There are some things in them that are hard to understand, which the ignorant and unstable twist to their own destruction, as they do the other Scriptures.|This verse emphasizes the complexity of Paul's writings and how those lacking understanding distort the Scriptures, leading to their own destruction. The mention of 'ignorant' and 'unstable' conveys a warning against misinterpreting sacred texts. It highlights the necessity of sound understanding in matters of faith.|
|2PE 3:17|Therefore, beloved, knowing this in advance, take care that you are not led astray by the error of lawless people and fall from your own stability.|This translation emphasizes the need for vigilance against deception and the importance of perseverance in faith. The phrase 'preserve yourselves' is meant to capture the idea of actively guarding one's faith.|
|2PE 3:18|But grow in grace and in the knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. To Him be glory both now and forever. Amen.|In this verse, the call to grow in grace and knowledge is imperative for believers. The structure emphasizes the importance of spiritual growth in the Christian life, indicating that this growth is rooted in the person and work of Jesus Christ. The mention of glory signifies the eternal aspect of this relationship with Christ, which is both present and future.|
