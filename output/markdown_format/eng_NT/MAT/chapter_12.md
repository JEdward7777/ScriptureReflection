The emphasis is on the principle of necessity, particularly when addressing accusations about the Sabbath laws. The phrase 'when he was hungry' is a key element that illustrates the human need for sustenance.|

This translation maintains the nuance of the original text regarding who is permitted to consume the holy bread.|

This highlights the understanding that the Sabbath was made for man's benefit, and necessary work within God's service is permitted.|
|MAT 12:6|But I tell you that something greater than the temple is here.|In this verse, Jesus emphasizes the greater significance of the temple over the Sabbath regulations, indicating that the temple represents a higher authority. The word 'greater' is significant as it highlights the supremacy of divine purpose over ritualistic adherence.|
|MAT 12:7|If you had understood what this means, 'I desire mercy, not sacrifice,' you would not have condemned the innocent.|In this verse, Jesus emphasizes the importance of mercy over ritual sacrifices, reflecting the heart of God's desire for compassion and justice. The phrase 'I desire mercy' is a direct quote from Hosea, reinforcing the continuity of God's message throughout scripture.|
|MAT 12:8|For the Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath.|This verse highlights the authority of Jesus as the Son of Man, emphasizing his lordship over the Sabbath, which reflects his divine nature and mission. It serves as a reminder that mercy and compassion are more aligned with God's heart than mere ritual observance.|
|MAT 12:9|And moving on from there, He entered their synagogue.|The phrase 'he moved from there' is a transition indicating Jesus' change of location to the synagogue. 'Synagogue' refers to the place of worship and community gathering, which is significant in Jewish tradition.|
|MAT 12:10|And behold, there was a man there with a withered hand. And they asked Him, saying, 'Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath?'—that they might accuse Him.|In this verse, the tension between the observance of the Sabbath and acts of compassion is highlighted. The term 'heal' relates directly to the Pharisees' interpretation of the Law, raising questions about what is lawful on the Sabbath. The Greek word 'ἐπηρώτησαν' indicates a probing or challenging question, emphasizing the confrontational context of the inquiry.|
|MAT 12:11|But He said to them, 'Which of you, having a single sheep, if it falls into a pit on the Sabbath, will not lay hold of it and lift it out?'|This verse illustrates Jesus' argument concerning the value of human life over the strict observance of Sabbath law. It highlights the inconsistency in the Pharisees' interpretation of the Sabbath by comparing the need to rescue an animal with the need to heal a person.|
|MAT 12:12|How much more valuable is a man than a sheep? Therefore, it is lawful to do good on the Sabbath.|This verse emphasizes the value of human life and well-being compared to animals, highlighting the permissibility of doing good on the Sabbath.

And he stretched it out, and it was restored to health, as healthy as the other.|This verse illustrates the act of healing on the Sabbath, emphasizing the authority of Jesus and the restoration of the man's hand. The wording is crafted to reflect both the command of Jesus and the immediate obedience of the man, showcasing the transformative power of faith and Jesus’ healing ability.|
|MAT 12:14|But the Pharisees went out and conspired against Him, how they might destroy Him.|The term 'Pharisees' refers to a Jewish religious group known for strict adherence to the Law. The phrase 'took counsel against Him' indicates a conspiracy, while 'to destroy Him' clearly signifies their intention to eliminate Jesus as a threat.|
|MAT 12:15|But Jesus, aware of this, withdrew from there. Many crowds followed Him, and He healed them all.|This verse highlights the compassionate nature of Jesus, emphasizing His ability to heal and His response to the multitude that followed Him, indicating His recognition of their needs and His commitment to ministering to them.|
|MAT 12:16|And He sternly instructed them not to make Him known.|In this verse, the emphasis is on Jesus commanding silence about His identity and mission. The Greek term 'ἐπετίμησεν' conveys a sense of authority and urgency, which is consistent in other instances where Jesus instructs others to keep His works and identity confidential. The term 'φανερὸν' highlights the idea of making something known or visible, which is central to the narrative of Jesus' ministry and His desire to avoid premature recognition.|
|MAT 12:17|This was to fulfill what was spoken through the prophet Isaiah, saying:|This verse references the prophetic words of Isaiah, illustrating that the actions of Jesus fulfill the prophecy about His mission and nature.

|MAT 12:19|He will not quarrel or cry out, nor will anyone hear His voice in the streets.|This verse illustrates the gentleness and quiet authority of Christ's ministry, emphasizing that He does not strive or raise His voice in the pursuit of His mission. The choice of words reflects His humility and the peaceful nature of His approach to proclaiming justice.|
|MAT 12:20|A bruised reed He will not break, and a smoldering wick He will not extinguish, until He leads justice to victory.|The original Greek phrase 'κάλαμον συντετριμμένον' refers to something that is weak or broken, symbolizing gentleness and compassion, while 'λίνον τυφόμενον' refers to a wick that is barely burning, representing a flicker of hope. This translation captures the essence of Christ's tender mercy and His commitment to uphold justice without extinguishing the fragile.|
|MAT 12:21|And in His name, the nations will place their hope.|This verse highlights the universal hope in Christ's name among the nations. The Greek term 'ἔθνη' translates to 'nations' and conveys the sense of peoples beyond Israel who are looking towards the Messiah.|

The terms used here are consistent with the language used in similar accounts of healing in the Gospels, where the authority of Jesus over demonic forces is demonstrated. The translation maintains a clear and straightforward style, reflecting the urgency and miraculous nature of the event.|

|MAT 12:24|But when the Pharisees heard this, they said, "This man does not cast out demons except by Beelzebul, the ruler of the demons."|This verse captures the reaction of the Pharisees who attribute Jesus' power to cast out demons to Beelzebul, reflecting their disbelief and hostility toward Him. The term 'Beelzebul' can imply a specific demonic figure known as the 'lord of the flies' or 'lord of dung,' and serves to highlight their attempts to undermine Jesus' authority.|
|MAT 12:25|But knowing their thoughts, Jesus said to them, "Every kingdom divided against itself will be brought to desolation, and every city or house divided against itself will not stand."|In this verse, Jesus addresses the reasoning behind division, emphasizing that a divided kingdom or household cannot endure. The phrase 'a kingdom divided against itself' is echoed in other verses, reinforcing the principle of unity for stability. The use of 'desolate' and 'stand' reflects the consequences of division, both politically and personally, which is a recurring theme in the teachings of Jesus.|
|MAT 12:26|And if Satan drives out Satan, he is divided against himself; how then will his kingdom stand?|In this verse, Jesus highlights the absurdity of division within the ranks of Satan's forces. The original language emphasizes the impossibility of Satan working against himself, making the point that such division leads to destruction. The word 'kingdom' refers to Satan's dominion, and the term 'cast out' reflects the act of expelling or overcoming, reinforcing the power dynamics at play.|
|MAT 12:27|And if I cast out demons by Beelzebul, by whom do your sons cast them out? Therefore, they will be your judges.|In this verse, Jesus is challenging the logic of attributing his exorcistic powers to Beelzebul (the devil), asking the question of how his critics reconcile their claims about him with the actions of their own followers who cast out demons. The term 'sons' is understood to refer to the followers or disciples of the Pharisees, thereby presenting a logical inconsistency in their accusations.|
|MAT 12:28|But if I drive out demons by the Spirit of God, then the Kingdom of God has truly arrived among you.|This verse emphasizes the divine authority Jesus wields in casting out demons. The use of 'Spirit of God' connects the action of exorcism directly to God's power, reinforcing the notion that the Kingdom of God is present through such miracles. The phrasing 'has come upon you' indicates a current reality rather than a distant future hope, suggesting that the Kingdom is actively breaking into the world through Jesus's ministry.|
|MAT 12:29|Or how can someone enter the strong man’s house and carry off his possessions unless he first binds the strong man? Then he can plunder his house.|This verse illustrates the need for power and strategy in overcoming a formidable opponent. The metaphor of the strong man signifies a forceful entity, while binding him denotes taking authority. This concept parallels spiritual warfare in which overcoming evil requires first confronting its strongholds.|
|MAT 12:30|Anyone who is not with me stands against me, and anyone who does not gather with me scatters.|This verse emphasizes the division between those who are aligned with Christ and those who oppose Him. The use of 'with' and 'against' highlights the binary nature of allegiance to Christ, as well as the consequences of one's choices in relation to Him.|
|MAT 12:31|Therefore I say to you, every sin and blasphemy will be forgiven people, but the blasphemy against the Spirit will not be forgiven.|This verse highlights the serious nature of blasphemy against the Holy Spirit, contrasting it with the forgiveness available for other sins. It is significant in the context of Jesus' ministry and teachings about the nature of sin and the Spirit's work in the lives of believers.|
|MAT 12:32|And whoever speaks a word against the Son of Man will be forgiven; but whoever speaks against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven, either in this age or in the age to come.|This verse highlights the gravity of speaking against the Holy Spirit, indicating a deeper level of offense compared to speaking against the Son of Man. The distinction made emphasizes the unique authority and divinity of the Holy Spirit within the Trinity. The use of 'forgiveness' (ἀφεθήσεται) is critical as it denotes the complete release from guilt, which is contrasted with the unforgivable nature of blaspheming the Holy Spirit.|
|MAT 12:33|Either make the tree good, and its fruit good, or make the tree bad, and its fruit bad; for a tree is known by its fruit.|In this verse, Jesus presents a dichotomy between good and bad trees, which is a metaphor for moral character. The emphasis on fruit as a reflection of the tree symbolizes how one's actions reveal their true nature. The structure of the sentence highlights the impossibility of having good and bad simultaneously, thus reinforcing the idea that one’s true identity is evident through their deeds.|
|MAT 12:34|Brood of vipers, how can you, being evil, speak good things? For out of the abundance of the heart, the mouth speaks.|In this verse, Jesus uses the imagery of a snake's offspring to highlight the inherent nature of those who are evil. The phrase 'good treasure' in the related verses aligns with the concept of the heart's abundance, which directly affects speech. This highlights the biblical principle that one's true character is revealed through their words.|
|MAT 12:35|A good person brings forth good things from the good treasure of his heart, while an evil person brings forth evil things from the evil treasure.|This translation focuses on the contrast between the good and evil character of individuals and the moral outcomes of their actions. It maintains the parallel structure of the original text and uses modern English that retains the original meanings.|
|MAT 12:36|But I say to you that every idle word that people speak, they will give an account for it on the day of judgment.|This verse emphasizes the accountability of individuals for their words, highlighting the seriousness of speech in the context of final judgment. It reflects the biblical principle that words are significant and can reveal one's character.|
|MAT 12:37|For by your words you will be justified, and by your words you will be condemned.|This verse highlights the profound implications of our speech, suggesting that our words serve as a reflection of our character and will ultimately determine our justification or condemnation. The emphasis on 'words' in both the context of judgment and the condition of the heart is crucial.|
|MAT 12:38|Then some of the scribes and Pharisees answered Him, saying, 'Teacher, we wish to see a sign from You.'|This translation reflects the urgent desire of the scribes and Pharisees to see a sign, indicative of their skepticism and the challenge posed to Jesus. The phrase 'a sign' is used to signify a miraculous proof of authority, a common request in the Gospels from those questioning Jesus' identity and mission.|
|MAT 12:39|But He answered and said to them, 'A wicked and adulterous generation seeks after a sign, and no sign will be given to it except the sign of Jonah the prophet.'|In this verse, Jesus responds to the request for a sign by condemning the generation as wicked and adulterous, which emphasizes their lack of faith and moral failing. The reference to the 'sign of Jonah' alludes to Jonah's time in the belly of the fish, symbolizing His own death and resurrection. The term 'adulterous' here implies unfaithfulness not just in marital terms, but also in their relationship with God.|
|MAT 12:40|For just as Jonah was in the belly of the great fish for three days and three nights, so will the Son of Man be in the heart of the earth for three days and three nights.|This verse draws a parallel between Jonah's three days in the belly of the great fish and Jesus' impending three days in the heart of the earth, symbolizing death and resurrection. The phrase 'heart of the earth' is an expression referring to the grave or the place of the dead, emphasizing the depth of Jesus' sacrifice.|
|MAT 12:41|The men of Nineveh will rise in judgment against this generation and will condemn it, for they repented at the preaching of Jonah; and behold, something greater than Jonah is here.|This verse highlights the contrast between the repentance of the Ninevites and the unbelief of the generation at the time of Jesus. The term 'judgment' suggests a decisive assessment of faith and actions, while 'repentance' indicates a turning back to God, which is a central theme in both the ministry of Jesus and the prophetic call of Jonah.|
|MAT 12:42|The queen of the South will rise up at the judgment with this generation and condemn it, for she traveled from the farthest parts of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and behold, something greater than Solomon is here.|This verse emphasizes the contrast between the wisdom of Solomon and the rejection of that wisdom by Jesus's contemporaries. The phrase 'something greater than Solomon' underlines Jesus' authority and divinity, and the 'queen of the south' refers to the Queen of Sheba who sought Solomon's wisdom.|
|MAT 12:43|When the unclean spirit has gone out of a person, it wanders through waterless places, seeking rest, but it finds none.|In this verse, the 'unclean spirit' is depicted as seeking rest in desolate places. This reflects a theme of spiritual desolation and the futility of seeking peace outside of God. The contrast with the verses about wisdom and judgment highlights the spiritual warfare that is ongoing even after the departure of unclean spirits. The choice of 'waterless places' symbolizes a state of emptiness, akin to the condition of the heart without God.|
|MAT 12:44|Then it says, ‘I will return to my house from which I came.’ And when it arrives, it finds the place empty, swept, and beautifully adorned.|The verse captures the idea of a returning unclean spirit finding its former abode, highlighting the state of emptiness or unoccupied space in the individual’s life. The terms used imply a sense of preparation and appearance, signifying how the spirit finds the place decorated but ultimately vacant of true spiritual life.|
|MAT 12:45|Then it goes and takes with it seven other spirits more wicked than itself, and they enter in and dwell there; and the last state of that man becomes worse than the first. So it will be with this wicked generation.|This verse illustrates the danger of spiritual emptiness, where the initial state is cleaned but ultimately becomes worse if left unguarded. The seven spirits represent a significant increase in wickedness compared to the original solitary evil. The term 'last state' emphasizes the final condition being more dire than the beginning, resonating with themes found in 2 Peter 2:20.|
|MAT 12:46|While He was still speaking to the crowds, behold, His mother and His brothers stood outside, seeking to speak with Him.|In this verse, Jesus is speaking to the crowd when His mother and brothers come to speak with Him. The focus is on the family relationship and the prioritization of spiritual ties over earthly ones. The phrase 'standing outside' indicates a physical separation that symbolizes a deeper spiritual meaning about true kinship.|
|MAT 12:47|And someone said to Him, "Look, Your mother and Your brothers are standing outside, seeking to speak with You."|This verse reflects the importance of family relations in the context of Jesus' ministry. The term 'mother' is used with respect and love, while 'brothers' indicates His earthly family. The phrase 'seeking to see' conveys a sense of desire and urgency from His family, highlighting the tension between familial expectations and Jesus' mission.|
|MAT 12:48|But He answered the one who told Him, 'Who is My mother, and who are My brothers?'|This verse highlights the idea of spiritual family in contrast to biological ties, emphasizing the importance of those who do the will of God as true family members of Jesus.|
|MAT 12:49|And stretching out His hand toward His disciples, He said, 'Here are My mother and My brothers.'|In this verse, Jesus emphasizes the relationship of spiritual kinship over biological ties. The use of 'my mother' and 'my brothers' serves to redefine family in the context of discipleship and obedience to God.|
|MAT 12:50|For whoever does the will of my Father who is in heaven, he is my brother, and sister, and mother.|In this verse, Jesus emphasizes the significance of doing the will of God the Father. The familial terms ('brother', 'sister', and 'mother') signify a deep spiritual kinship that transcends earthly relations, establishing the bonds of faith and obedience as primary. The structure is intended to affirm that all who adhere to God's will are considered part of His spiritual family, echoing themes found throughout the New Testament regarding love, obedience, and identity in Christ.|
