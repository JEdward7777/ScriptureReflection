|:---------:|-------|-------------------|
|MAT 9:1|And He got into a boat, crossed over, and arrived at His own city.|In this translation, I chose to use the term 'set sail' to convey the idea of boarding a boat, while 'arrived' signifies the culmination of the journey to His own city. The phrase 'His own city' is used to emphasize the connection between Jesus and the place He returned to, highlighting both a physical location and a sense of belonging.|

The phrase 'take heart' expresses encouragement and confidence, while the declaration of forgiveness introduces a key theological concept about the connection between sin and healing in Jesus' ministry.|
|MAT 9:3|And behold, some of the scribes said among themselves, 'This man is speaking blasphemy.'|The term 'blaspheme' in this verse carries the connotation of speaking irreverently about God or sacred things. The use of 'scribes' suggests the presence of learned individuals who are questioning Jesus's authority and actions, reflecting their role as interpreters of the Law.|
|MAT 9:4|And Jesus, perceiving their thoughts, said, "Why do you harbor evil intentions in your hearts?"|In this verse, Jesus addresses the inward thoughts of the scribes, highlighting their intentions and the nature of their hearts. The term 'ponderings' conveys a deep reflection, akin to 'thoughts' or 'intentions,' indicating a level of introspection and moral evaluation.|
|MAT 9:5|For which is easier to say, 'Your sins are forgiven,' or to say, 'Rise up and walk?'|In this verse, Jesus contrasts the declaration of forgiveness of sins with the command to heal, demonstrating His authority over both spiritual and physical realms. The phrase 'Which is easier' is rhetorical, as both actions carry divine authority but address different human needs: spiritual healing and physical restoration.|
|MAT 9:6|But so that you may understand that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins, he then said to the paralytic, 'Get up, take your bed, and go home.'|In this verse, Jesus asserts his authority as the Son of Man to forgive sins, demonstrating the divine prerogative he possesses on earth. The command to the paralytic to rise and take his bed signifies both physical restoration and the spiritual implications of forgiveness. The phrase 'Son of Man' emphasizes his human identity, while 'authority on earth' highlights the extent of his power.|
|MAT 9:7|And rising up, he went away to his house.|This translation focuses on conveying the immediate action of the paralytic responding to Jesus' command, emphasizing his healing and restoration. The term 'home' indicates a return to a place of comfort and belonging after an experience of restoration.|

The phrase 'follow Me' is a pivotal call in the New Testament, indicating a transformation from a life of sin to a life of discipleship. Matthew's immediate response exemplifies the nature of true discipleship, characterized by willingness and urgency.|
|MAT 9:10|And it happened that as Jesus was reclining in the house, behold, many tax collectors and sinners came and reclined with Him and His disciples.|This translation captures the essence of the gathering in the house where Jesus was reclining at the table.

The inclusion of 'tax collectors' highlights the social stigma associated with them, often viewed as dishonest and corrupt.|
|MAT 9:11|When the Pharisees saw this, they said to His disciples, 'Why does your Teacher eat with tax collectors and sinners?'|In this translation, the focus is on the interaction between the Pharisees and the disciples regarding Jesus' association with those considered sinners.

The term 'teacher' is used to denote Jesus' role as a rabbi, which aligns with the context of the verse.|
|MAT 9:12|But when Jesus heard this, He said to them, 'It is not the healthy who need a physician, but the sick.'|This translation emphasizes the contrasting groups of people (the healthy and the sick) while maintaining the intention of Jesus’ message about His mission to those in need of healing and forgiveness.|
|MAT 9:13|But go and learn what this means: 'I desire mercy, not sacrifice.'

This contrast serves to emphasize Jesus' new covenant message of grace and joy in His presence.|
|MAT 9:15|And Jesus said to them, 'Can the sons of the bridechamber mourn while the bridegroom is with them? As long as they have the bridegroom with them, they cannot mourn. But the days will come when the bridegroom will be taken away from them, and then they will fast.'|This verse emphasizes the concept of joy and celebration associated with the presence of the bridegroom, who is a metaphor for Jesus. It indicates that fasting is not appropriate while the bridegroom is present, but it also foreshadows a time when He will no longer be with them, marking a period of mourning and reflection.|
|MAT 9:16|No one sews a patch of unshrunken cloth onto an old garment; for the patch will pull away from the garment, and a worse tear will result.|The verse emphasizes the incompatibility of old and new, using the metaphor of an old garment and new cloth.

The act of kneeling signifies reverence and urgency, while the request reveals a deep need for intervention. It connects themes of faith and healing present in other parts of the Gospels.|
|MAT 9:19|And Jesus arose and followed him, along with his disciples.|In this verse, Jesus' immediate response to the request of the ruler is emphasized by the verb 'followed' (ἠκολούθησεν), which denotes a willing and active following. The inclusion of 'and his disciples' suggests the collective commitment of those who were learning from Jesus. This reflects the early Christian theme of discipleship and the readiness to act in faith when called upon.|

The phrase 'thronging and making a tumult' highlights the chaos and despair surrounding the scene, setting the stage for Jesus’ powerful statement about the girl’s true condition.|
|MAT 9:24|'Go away, for the girl is not dead; she is just sleeping.' And they laughed at Him.|The phrase 'but sleeping' signifies that the girl has not truly died but is in a state resembling sleep, indicating the miraculous nature of her condition and Jesus' authority over death. The term 'sleep' is often used in Scripture to denote the temporary state of death for believers, emphasizing hope and resurrection.|
|MAT 9:25|But when the crowd had been put outside, He went in, took her by the hand, and the girl arose.|In this translation, I preserved the meaning of the original Greek text, emphasizing the authoritative action of Jesus in bringing the girl back to life. The words chosen reflect a straightforward, yet reverent, depiction of the miracle.|
|MAT 9:26|And this report spread throughout all that land.|The original Greek text emphasizes the widespread nature of the news regarding Jesus' miracles, particularly focusing on the geographical scope ('to the whole land'). In this translation, the term 'fame' has been chosen to convey the recognition and reputation that Jesus garnered following His miracles, while remaining consistent with biblical terminology.|
|MAT 9:27|And as Jesus went on from there, two blind men followed Him, crying out, "Have mercy on us, Son of David!"|The verse captures the earnest plea of the two blind men as they acknowledge Jesus’ lineage and authority by calling Him 'Son of David.'

The use of 'opened' reflects the physical restoration of sight, while 'commanded' indicates authority and urgency in Jesus' tone. The phrase 'let no one know' showcases the motif of the Messianic secret prevalent in the Gospels.|
