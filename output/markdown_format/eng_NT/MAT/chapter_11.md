|MAT 11:1|Now it came to pass, when Jesus had finished instructing His twelve disciples, that He departed from there to teach and to proclaim in their cities.|In this verse, the focus is on Jesus completing his instructions to the twelve disciples and then moving on to teach and proclaim in their cities. The words ‘to teach’ and ‘to proclaim’ are significant, indicating the dual nature of Jesus’ ministry—both instruction and declaration of the good news. The use of 'cities' connects this action to the larger community and highlights the missional aspect of the disciples' journey.|
|MAT 11:2|Now when John the Baptist heard in prison about the works of the Christ, he sent two of his disciples.|This verse emphasizes John the Baptist's awareness of Jesus' ministry while he is imprisoned, highlighting his role as a forerunner and the fulfillment of his mission. The choice of the word 'works' reflects the miracles and teachings of Jesus, which John hears about through his disciples, showing both his faith and his inquiry regarding Jesus' identity as the Messiah.|
|MAT 11:3|He asked His disciples, 'Are You the One who is to come, or should we expect someone else?'|In this verse, John the Baptist, while imprisoned, seeks confirmation about Jesus' identity as the Messiah. The phrase 'the Coming One' reflects the Messianic expectation of a Savior, and the question posed signifies doubt or a desire for assurance in the face of suffering. The translation maintains the essence of questioning the awaited figure, emphasizing the direct inquiry of John about whether Jesus is the fulfillment of that expectation.|
|MAT 11:4|And Jesus answered them, 'Go and report to John what you hear and see:'|This verse highlights Jesus’ response to John's inquiry about His identity. The phrase 'what you hear and see' refers to the miraculous works of Jesus that serve as evidence of His messianic identity, aligning with Old Testament prophecies regarding the Messiah's signs.|
|MAT 11:5|The blind receive their sight, the lame walk, lepers are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead are raised, and the poor have the good news proclaimed to them.|This translation emphasizes the miraculous works of Jesus and their significance as fulfillment of prophecy, particularly the themes of healing and preaching good news to the marginalized.|
|MAT 11:6|And blessed is the one who does not take offense at me.|In this verse, the term 'μακάριός' (blessed) implies a deep sense of happiness or approval from God for those who maintain faith and do not take offense at Christ's ministry. The phrase 'ἐὰν μὴ σκανδαλισθῇ' suggests a temptation to stumble or be offended, which is crucial to understand the blessings tied to unwavering faith in the face of challenges or misunderstandings about Jesus's identity and work.|
|MAT 11:7|As these men were leaving, Jesus began to speak to the crowds about John: "What did you go out into the wilderness to see? A reed swaying in the wind?|In this verse, Jesus is reflecting on the expectations people had of John the Baptist, using the metaphor of a 'reed shaken by the wind' to illustrate their perception. The rhetorical question emphasizes John's strength and steadfastness in the face of opposition, contrasting with the notion of weakness suggested by the image of a reed.|
|MAT 11:8|But what did you go out to see? A man clothed in fine garments? Look, those who wear fine clothes are found in royal palaces.|In this verse, Jesus is contrasting the simple lifestyle of John the Baptist with the extravagance often associated with royalty and the wealthy. The Greek word ‘μαλακοῖς’ (soft or fine) is used to indicate luxury and comfort, which is not characteristic of a true prophet like John.|
|MAT 11:9|But what did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes, I tell you, and even more than a prophet.|The original Greek word 'προφήτην' means 'prophet' and carries a significant weight in the context of Jesus' ministry, as He is confirming John the Baptist's role as a prophet but also indicating his greater significance. The word 'περισσότερον' emphasizes the 'more' aspect, hinting at a higher status or role than that of a typical prophet.|
|MAT 11:10|For this is the one about whom it is written: 'Behold, I send my messenger before your face, who will prepare your way before you.'|In this verse, Jesus references the prophetic fulfillment of John the Baptist's role as a messenger. The word 'angel' (ἄγγελον) is used in a broader sense here, meaning 'messenger.' The concept of preparing the way signifies making a path clear for the coming of the Lord, emphasizing the importance of John’s ministry in the divine plan of redemption.|
|MAT 11:11|Truly, I say to you, among those born of women there has not arisen anyone greater than John the Baptist; yet the least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he.|This verse emphasizes the unique role of John the Baptist while highlighting the transformative nature of the Kingdom of Heaven, where the values of greatness and humility are turned upside down.

|MAT 11:12|From the days of John the Baptist until now, the kingdom of heaven has been forcefully advancing, and the passionate take hold of it.|The phrase 'the kingdom of heaven suffers violence' emphasizes the urgency and fervor with which people seek entrance into God's kingdom.

The imperative form ‘let them hear’ urges the audience to pay attention and engage with what is being communicated.|
|MAT 11:16|But to what shall I compare this generation? It is like children sitting in the marketplaces and calling out to their companions,|This verse employs a metaphor comparing the generation to children in the marketplace, highlighting their childish behavior and unwillingness to respond to the call of repentance. The term 'children' is used to evoke immaturity and a lack of understanding, which can be contrasted with the expectation of adults.|
|MAT 11:17|We played a joyful tune for you, but you did not dance; we sang a lament, but you did not mourn.|This verse employs imagery that reflects the contrast between expectation and response in a communal setting. The actions of playing and mourning suggest the cultural practices of the time, emphasizing the indifference of the generation to both joy and sorrow.|
|MAT 11:18|For John came neither eating nor drinking, and they say, 'He has a demon.'|In this verse, John the Baptist's ascetic lifestyle is contrasted with the criticism he faced, implying that despite his dedication, he was unjustly labeled as possessed. The wording aims to reflect the irony in how righteous living is misinterpreted by the people. The terms related to 'eating' and 'drinking' highlight the communal expectations of behavior, and the use of 'demon' connects to broader themes of spiritual discernment.|
|MAT 11:19|The Son of Man came eating and drinking, and they say, 'Look, a glutton and a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and sinners.' Yet wisdom is vindicated by her children.|In this verse, Jesus contrasts His approach to ministry with that of John the Baptist, illustrating how different people perceive wisdom and righteousness.

|MAT 11:21|Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! For if the mighty works that were done in you had been performed in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago, sitting in sackcloth and ashes.|In this verse, Jesus pronounces a woe upon the cities of Chorazin and Bethsaida due to their failure to repent despite the miraculous works performed among them. The imagery of sackcloth and ashes symbolizes deep mourning and repentance. The structure of the original text emphasizes the gravity of the situation and the missed opportunity for the people of those cities to respond to His message with genuine remorse.|
|MAT 11:22|But I say to you, it will be more bearable for Tyre and Sidon on the day of judgment than for you.|This translation emphasizes the contrasting judgments of Tyre and Sidon compared to Chorazin and Bethsaida. The terms of 'more tolerable' are rendered to convey the sense of differing degrees of accountability based on received revelation and response to God's work.|
|MAT 11:23|And you, Capernaum, will you be lifted up to the heavens? You will be brought down to the realm of the dead; for if the miraculous works that were performed in you had been done in Sodom, it would have remained until this day.|This verse emphasizes the judgment of Capernaum, elevating the significance of its rejection of Christ's works. The mention of being 'exalted to heaven' contrasts with the prophetic 'brought down to Hades', showcasing the ultimate consequences of unrepentance. The reference to the mightier works done in Sodom underscores the gravity of Capernaum's disbelief, implying that they would have repented had they seen such signs.|
|MAT 11:24|But I tell you that it will be more bearable for the land of Sodom on the day of judgment than for you.|The translation aims to capture the solemnity of judgment implied in the original Greek, emphasizing the comparison between Capernaum and Sodom.

|MAT 11:25|At that time, Jesus declared, ‘I thank you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that you have hidden these things from the wise and intelligent, and have revealed them to little children;’|This verse captures the essence of Jesus' gratitude to the Father for revealing divine truths to those who are humble and child-like in faith, contrasting this with the wisdom of the proud and learned. The term 'revealed' suggests an intimate and personal understanding granted by God, while 'hidden' indicates a deliberate obscuring of truth from those who rely solely on human intellect.|
|MAT 11:26|Yes, Father, for it was your good pleasure to do it this way.|In this verse, Jesus acknowledges the sovereign will of God in revealing truth to the humble while concealing it from the wise and proud. The phrase ‘for so it was your good pleasure’ conveys a sense of divine delight in God's decisions.|
|MAT 11:27|All things have been entrusted to me by my Father. No one knows the Son except the Father, and no one knows the Father except the Son and those to whom the Son chooses to reveal him.|This verse emphasizes the unique relationship between the Father and the Son, highlighting that true knowledge of one cannot exist without the other. It also suggests the divine authority given to the Son, indicating that only he can reveal the Father to others, reflecting the intimate communion within the Trinity.|
|MAT 11:28|Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest.|This verse is an invitation from Jesus to those who are weary and burdened, emphasizing His role as a source of rest and relief.

The promise of rest for the souls conveys deep spiritual peace and renewal that Jesus offers to those who follow Him.|
|MAT 11:30|For my yoke is kind, and my burden is light.|The Greek term 'ζυγός' (yoke) represents a figurative weight or burden, often implying the responsibilities or expectations placed on individuals. 'χρηστὸς' (good or kind) and 'ἐλαφρόν' (light) are used here to emphasize the ease and pleasantness of Jesus' call compared to other burdens.|
