The focus is on the empowerment of the disciples for the ministry ahead of them. 'Authority' is rendered to reflect the divine empowerment given to them by Jesus. The term for 'unclean spirits' indicates spiritual oppression, while 'disease' and 'affliction' encompass physical ailments.|
|MAT 10:2|Now, these are the names of the twelve apostles: first, Simon, who is called Peter, and his brother Andrew; James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother.|The Greek word 'ἀποστόλων' translates to 'apostles,' signifying those chosen to spread the Gospel. The names are presented in a way that emphasizes their significance in the early Church.|
|MAT 10:3|Philip and Bartholomew; Thomas and Matthew the tax collector; James the son of Alphaeus, and Thaddeus, who is also called Lebbaeus.|The names listed here reflect the apostles chosen by Jesus, highlighting the diversity among them in terms of backgrounds and roles. The translation aims to maintain the distinctiveness of each name as it appears in the Greek text.|
|MAT 10:4|Simon the Zealot, and Judas Iscariot, who also betrayed Him.|In this verse, Simon is identified with the title 'the Zealot' in some traditions, while in this case, the term 'Canaanite' refers to his origin, indicating he belonged to a region associated with zeal or passionate fervor for Jewish nationalism. Judas Iscariot's identity as 'the one who betrayed him' is significant for understanding the narrative context and the gravity of his actions.|
|MAT 10:5|These twelve Jesus sent out, commanding them, saying, 'Do not go on the road of the Gentiles, and do not enter a city of the Samaritans;'|In this verse, Jesus instructs His disciples regarding their mission, emphasizing a specific focus on the people of Israel rather than Gentiles or Samaritans at this stage.

|MAT 10:6|But rather go to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.|This verse emphasizes the mission of Jesus and His disciples focusing on the Jewish people, especially those who are spiritually lost, as symbolized by 'the lost sheep.'

|MAT 10:7|As you go, preach, saying, 'The kingdom of heaven has come near.'|In this translation, I focused on capturing the urgency of the message being conveyed by the disciples, emphasizing both the act of preaching and the proclamation of the kingdom's imminent arrival.

Yet not one of them will fall to the ground apart from your Father.|In this verse, Jesus emphasizes the providence of God over even the smallest creatures, highlighting God's intimate knowledge and care for His creation.
