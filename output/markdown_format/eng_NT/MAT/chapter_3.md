| Reference | Verse | Translation Notes |
|:---------:|-------|-------------------|
|MAT 3:1|In those days, John the Baptist appeared, preaching in the wilderness of Judea.|This verse introduces John the Baptist and sets the scene for his ministry in the wilderness. It emphasizes the prophetic fulfillment of preparing the way for the Lord, linking John’s role to that of a prophet crying out in the wilderness, which is a recurring theme in the Old Testament.|
|MAT 3:2|And saying, 'Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is drawing near.'|This translation emphasizes the urgency of repentance and the impending arrival of the kingdom of heaven, maintaining the original intent and tone of the Greek text while using contemporary language.|
|MAT 3:3|For this is he who was spoken of by the prophet Isaiah, saying: 'The voice of one crying in the wilderness, prepare the way of the Lord; make His paths straight.'|This verse refers to the prophecy in Isaiah that foretells the coming of John the Baptist as a forerunner to Jesus. The imagery of preparing the way and making paths straight signifies the spiritual readiness required for the arrival of the Lord. The translation aims to capture the urgency and prophetic significance of John’s message.|
|MAT 3:4|Now John himself had clothing made of camel's hair, with a leather belt around his waist, and his food was locusts and wild honey.|This translation aims to reflect the original Greek structure and meaning, maintaining a balance between literal translation and readability. The reference to John the Baptist's clothing and diet symbolizes his ascetic lifestyle and prophetic role.|
|MAT 3:5|Then people from Jerusalem and all of Judea, and all the region around the Jordan, went out to him.|This translation aims to preserve the original structure and intent of the Greek text while using contemporary language that remains faithful to the Biblical context. Key locations such as Jerusalem, Judea, and the Jordan River are included to emphasize the geographical significance in the narrative.|
|MAT 3:6|And they were baptized by him in the Jordan River, confessing their sins.|This translation captures the essence of the act of baptism as a public acknowledgment of sin and a step towards forgiveness and repentance, maintaining the core theological implications present in the original Greek.|
|MAT 3:7|But when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming to his baptism, he said to them, 'You brood of vipers! Who warned you to flee from the coming wrath?'|This verse emphasizes John the Baptist's confrontation with the Pharisees and Sadducees, whom he accuses of being hypocritical and not genuinely repentant. The term 'brood of vipers' implies a connection to evil and deceit, warning them of impending judgment. The phrase 'who warned you' signifies that their appearance for baptism lacks sincerity, highlighting the theme of true repentance versus superficial action.|
|MAT 3:8|Therefore, produce fruit that reflects true repentance.|The phrase 'produce fruit worthy of repentance' emphasizes the need for genuine transformation and actions that reflect true repentance. This aligns with the broader biblical theme that faith must be accompanied by corresponding deeds.|
|MAT 3:9|And do not presume to say among yourselves, ‘We have Abraham as our father.’ For I tell you, God is able to raise up children for Abraham from these stones.|In this verse, John the Baptist is addressing the Pharisees and Sadducees, warning them against their misplaced confidence in their lineage as descendants of Abraham. The phrase 'God is able' emphasizes God's sovereign power to bring forth descendants from the stones, indicating that true lineage to Abraham is not merely physical but spiritual and based on faith and obedience.|
|MAT 3:10|The axe is already laid at the root of the trees; therefore, every tree that does not produce good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.|In this verse, the metaphor of the axe signifies imminent judgment. The 'root of the trees' emphasizes the source of life and fruitfulness, implying that true righteousness must originate from a genuine relationship with God. The terms 'cut down' and 'thrown into the fire' indicate a definitive and irrevocable judgment for those not producing good fruit, which reflects the broader theme of accountability in the New Testament.|
|MAT 3:11|I indeed baptize you with water for repentance; but the one coming after me is mightier than I, whose sandals I am not worthy to carry; he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and with fire.|In this verse, John the Baptist distinguishes between his own baptism with water, which signifies repentance, and the baptism that Jesus will administer, characterized by the Holy Spirit and fire. This contrast emphasizes the greater authority and power of Jesus in the act of baptism, moving from a physical act to a spiritual transformation.|
|MAT 3:12|His winnowing fork is in his hand, and he will thoroughly clean out his threshing floor; he will gather his wheat into the barn, but the chaff he will burn with unquenchable fire.|In this verse, the imagery of the winnowing fork signifies the separation of the righteous from the unrighteous. The burning of chaff represents divine judgment, highlighting the necessity of spiritual discernment and accountability.|
|MAT 3:13|Then Jesus came from Galilee to the Jordan, to John, to be baptized by him.|This translation emphasizes Jesus' purposeful arrival to be baptized by John, highlighting his humility and the significance of the baptism in his mission. The choice of words aims to convey both the geographical context and the divine nature of this pivotal moment.|
|MAT 3:14|But John tried to prevent Him, saying, "I have need to be baptized by You, and are You coming to me?"|In this verse, John the Baptist expresses his unworthiness to baptize Jesus, emphasizing the significance of Jesus' ministry over his own. The original Greek text's structure highlights John's humility and recognition of Jesus' superiority. The phrase 'I have need to be baptized by You' reflects a profound acknowledgment of the divine nature of Christ.|
|MAT 3:15|But Jesus answered him, saying, "Let it be so now, for it is fitting for us to fulfill all righteousness." Then John consented to Him.|In this translation, I emphasized the significance of fulfilling all righteousness, which underscores the importance of obedience to God's plan. The phrase 'to fulfill all righteousness' conveys the necessity of aligning with God's divine order and purpose, which Jesus is demonstrating in His willingness to be baptized.|
|MAT 3:16|As soon as Jesus was baptized, He came up out of the water. At that moment, the heavens were opened to Him, and He saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and coming to rest on Him.|In this translation, the emphasis is on the immediacy of Jesus' baptism and the significant event of the heavens opening, which signifies divine approval and the anointing of Jesus by the Holy Spirit. The metaphor of the dove reflects purity and peace, typical of the biblical symbolism associated with the Holy Spirit.|
|MAT 3:17|And behold, a voice from the heavens declared, 'This is my beloved Son, in whom I take great delight.'|In this translation, I sought to capture the reverence and significance of God's declaration regarding Jesus. The terms 'beloved Son' and 'with whom I am well pleased' convey deep affection and approval. The phrase is translated to maintain the formal and sacred tone of the original text.|
