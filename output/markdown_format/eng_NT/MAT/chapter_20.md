| Reference | Verse | Translation Notes |
|:---------:|-------|-------------------|
|MAT 20:1|For the kingdom of heaven is like a landowner who went out early in the morning to hire laborers for his vineyard.|This verse uses agricultural imagery to illustrate the nature of God's kingdom and the calling of workers for His vineyard. The word 'οἰκοδεσπότης' refers to a master or lord of the house, indicating authority over the vineyard, which signifies God's kingdom. The act of going out early to hire laborers symbolizes God's initiative to gather workers for His work.|
|MAT 20:2|And having agreed with the laborers for a denarius for the day, he sent them into his vineyard.|In this verse, the emphasis is on the agreement made between the landowner and the laborers regarding their wage for the day. The use of the term 'denarius' signifies a standard daily wage, indicating fairness and contractual obligation.|
|MAT 20:3|And going out about the third hour, he saw others standing still in the marketplace.|This translation captures the urgency and nature of the hiring process as it relates to labor and the call to work. The term 'standing idle' is translated as 'standing still' to reflect the inactivity of those laborers. The word 'marketplace' is chosen for 'ἀγορᾷ' to signify a public place where work can be sought, emphasizing the social aspect of the hiring process.|
|MAT 20:4|And he said to them, ‘Go you also into the vineyard, and whatever is just, I will give you.’|The phrase ‘go into the vineyard’ is a metaphor for working in God's kingdom, implying both a call to labor and an assurance of fair remuneration. The use of ‘what is right’ suggests a principle of divine justice, paralleling similar themes in the surrounding biblical texts.|
|MAT 20:5|They went out again. About the sixth and the ninth hour, he did the same.|In this verse, the action of going out again and employing workers reflects the ongoing nature of the vineyard owner’s effort to find laborers, emphasizing both persistence and grace in hiring those who have not yet worked.|
|MAT 20:6|And about the eleventh hour, he went out and found others standing idle, and he said to them, 'Why have you been standing here all day long without work?'|The phrase 'ἑστῶτας ἀργούς' translates to 'standing idle' or 'unemployed', which captures the notion of being inactive. 'ὅλην τὴν ἡμέραν' emphasizes the duration of their inactivity throughout the day. This context underlines themes of labor and purpose.|
|MAT 20:7|They replied to him, 'No one has hired us.' He said to them, 'You go into the vineyard too, and whatever is fair, you shall receive.'|In this translation, I sought to maintain the intent of the original text while ensuring clarity for the reader. The term 'rightful wage' is emphasized to capture the fairness expressed in the dialogue.|
|MAT 20:8|When evening came, the owner of the vineyard said to his steward, ‘Call the laborers and give them their wages, starting from the last to the first.’|This verse highlights the authority of the lord of the vineyard in directing the payment of wages, emphasizing a reversal of expected order, where the last are first to receive their compensation. It reflects themes of fairness and divine justice prevalent in the parable.|
|MAT 20:9|And those who came about the eleventh hour received a denarius each.|This verse describes the moment when the workers who came late in the day received their wages. The use of 'denarius' indicates the standard wage for a day's work, and the context highlights the generosity of the vineyard owner.|
|MAT 20:10|But when the first came, they assumed they would receive more, yet they also received each a denarius.|In this translation, the word choices aim to convey the original Greek sense of expectation versus reality, particularly reflecting the surprise of the first workers regarding their payment. The phrase 'thought they would receive more' highlights the contrast between expectation and the outcome.|
|MAT 20:11|And upon receiving their payment, they began to grumble against the master of the house.|The verse captures the essence of grumbling or murmuring against the master of the house, which reflects dissatisfaction and entitlement among those who labored in the vineyard. It serves as a lesson about understanding grace and the nature of God’s generosity.|
|MAT 20:12|saying, ‘These last worked only one hour, and you have made them equal to us, who have borne the burden of the day and the scorching heat.’|In this translation, the focus is on the grumbling of the laborers who worked the least but were paid the same as those who worked longer hours. The term for 'equal' reflects the laborers' sentiment of injustice regarding their payment, and 'the heat of the day' emphasizes the hardship endured by those who labored longer. I have opted for a straightforward style to ensure clarity and adherence to the original meaning.|
|MAT 20:13|But he answered one of them, 'Friend, I am not being unjust to you; did we not agree on a denarius?'|In this verse, the landowner is responding to the complaint of the laborer who feels he has been treated unjustly. The word 'ἑταῖρε' is translated as 'friend', signifying a relationship, while 'ἀδικῶ' directly translates to 'do wrong' or 'act unjustly'. The question about the agreement on the payment highlights the importance of mutual understanding in transactions. The verse emphasizes fairness based on the agreement made.|
|MAT 20:14|Take what is yours and go. I choose to give this last one the same as I give you.|This verse captures the landowner's authority and generosity, contrasting the expectations of the workers with his own decisions regarding compensation. The phrase 'Take what is yours and go' reflects the idea of individual choice and agency, while 'I want to give this last one the same as you' emphasizes the theme of equality in God's kingdom, irrespective of human standards.|
|MAT 20:15|Is it not permissible for me to do what I wish with what belongs to me? Or is your eye envious because I am good?|In this verse, the owner of the vineyard questions the attitude of the laborers towards his authority and goodness. The term 'evil eye' (πονηρός) refers to a malevolent disposition, reflecting the workers' envy towards the landowner's generosity. The contrast between the landowner's benevolence and the workers' begrudging attitude is emphasized in this rhetorical question, illustrating a deeper truth about human nature and God's grace.|
|MAT 20:16|Thus, the last will be first, and the first will be last; for many are called, but few are chosen.|This verse encapsulates a theme found throughout the Gospels regarding the reversal of expectations in the Kingdom of God. The first being last and the last being first is a critical point illustrating the radical inclusivity of God's call. The word 'called' indicates those invited into the Kingdom, while 'chosen' denotes a select group among the many who respond.|
|MAT 20:17|As Jesus was ascending to Jerusalem, He took the twelve disciples aside privately along the way and said to them:|This verse highlights Jesus' deliberate decision to journey to Jerusalem, where significant events in His ministry would unfold, especially concerning His suffering and ultimate sacrifice. The phrase 'taking the twelve aside' emphasizes the private instruction and revelation He provided to His closest followers during this crucial time.|
|MAT 20:18|Behold, we are going up to Jerusalem, and the Son of Man will be handed over to the chief priests and the scribes, and they will condemn Him to death.|This translation emphasizes the foretelling of Jesus’ impending suffering and death as he approaches Jerusalem, using clear and direct language while maintaining the gravity of the original message.|
|MAT 20:19|and they will hand Him over to the Gentiles to be mocked and scourged and crucified, and on the third day He will rise again.|This translation aims to capture the foretelling of the suffering and resurrection of Jesus with clear and concise language. The terms 'delivered over', 'mocked', 'whipped', and 'crucified' are key actions that highlight the intensity of His impending suffering, and the phrase 'on the third day' succinctly points to His resurrection.|
|MAT 20:20|Then the mother of the sons of Zebedee approached Him, bowing down and asking Him for something.|In this verse, the mother of the sons of Zebedee approaches Jesus with reverence, asking for something significant. The use of 'worshiping' or 'kneeling' indicates both a position of respect and a plea for favor. The structure of the sentence captures her action and intention distinctly without deviating from the essence of the original text.|
|MAT 20:21|And He said to her, 'What do you wish?' She said to Him, 'Grant that these two sons of mine may sit, one on Your right hand and the other on Your left, in Your kingdom.'|In this verse, the request of the mother of the sons of Zebedee reflects the common aspiration for honor and position within the kingdom, highlighting a key theme of ambition and recognition in the teachings of Jesus. The phrase 'sit on your right hand and on your left' is a metaphorical expression indicating a desire for the highest status alongside Jesus.|
|MAT 20:22|But Jesus answered and said, 'You do not know what you are asking. Are you able to drink the cup that I am about to drink, or be baptized with the baptism with which I am to be baptized?' They said to Him, 'We are able.'|In this verse, Jesus speaks to the disciples about their understanding of the suffering and sacrifice associated with His impending death. The terms 'cup' and 'baptism' are metaphors for the trials He will face. The translation seeks to convey both the inquiry of Jesus and the disciples' assertive response while maintaining a reverent tone appropriate for the text.|
|MAT 20:23|He said to them, 'You will indeed drink from my cup, and be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with; but to sit at my right hand and at my left is not mine to grant, but is for those for whom it has been prepared by my Father.'|In this translation, the terms 'cup' and 'baptism' have been retained to emphasize their theological significance as metaphors for suffering and identification with Christ's mission. The phrase 'not mine to give' reflects the authoritative decision of God the Father concerning roles and rewards in the Kingdom.|
|MAT 20:24|And when the ten heard it, they became indignant about the two brothers.|This verse highlights the reaction of the other disciples when they hear about the request of James and John. The term 'angered' conveys the strong emotion they felt, which can also reflect feelings of rivalry and jealousy. The translation is designed to capture both the immediate emotional response and the social dynamics present among the disciples.|
|MAT 20:25|But Jesus called them to Himself and said, 'You know that the rulers of the Gentiles exercise dominion over them, and their great ones wield authority over them.'|In this verse, Jesus contrasts worldly leadership styles, characterized by domination and control, with the leadership he embodies, which is grounded in servanthood and humility. The terms used for 'rulers' and 'authority' reflect a hierarchical system often seen in both secular and religious structures of the time.|
|MAT 20:26|It shall not be this way among you; rather, whoever wishes to be great among you must be your servant.|In this verse, the contrast between worldly authority and Christ's teaching on leadership is evident. The term 'διάκονος' (diakonos) is often translated as 'servant' or 'minister,' emphasizing the call to humility and service as the true measure of greatness in the Kingdom of God.|
|MAT 20:27|And whoever wishes to be first among you shall be your servant.|The translation emphasizes the concept of servitude and humility that Jesus conveys, contrasting societal norms of greatness with the kingdom's principle of serving others. The word 'first' indicates leadership, while 'servant' highlights the expected attitude of true greatness among His followers.|
|MAT 20:28|Just as the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give His life as a ransom for many.|This translation seeks to capture the servant-leader nature of Christ, emphasizing His mission of service and sacrifice. The term 'ransom' is vital in understanding the theological implications of Christ's death.|
|MAT 20:29|As they were leaving Jericho, a large crowd followed Him.|In this translation, I have preserved the original intent of the verse by using 'crowd' to describe the group following Jesus, emphasizing their number and collective action as they leave Jericho. The term 'following' reflects their movement with Jesus, indicating not only physical proximity but also allegiance and attention to Him as He leaves the city. The context of His mission and the significant impact of His ministry in these towns resonate through the imagery of a large crowd following.|
|MAT 20:30|And behold, two blind men were sitting by the roadside, and when they heard that Jesus was passing by, they cried out, saying, ‘Lord, Son of David, have mercy on us!'|In this verse, the term 'Lord' (Κύριε) signifies authority and divinity, and 'Son of David' emphasizes the messianic title of Jesus. The phrase ‘have mercy on us’ reflects a common plea for divine intervention, underscoring both the faith of the blind men and the compassionate nature of Christ.|
|MAT 20:31|But the crowd rebuked them, telling them to be quiet; yet they shouted all the more, ‘Lord, Son of David, have mercy on us!'|This verse reflects the desperation of the blind men calling for Jesus' mercy, emphasizing the societal pressure to remain quiet but illustrating their determination to seek help from the Messiah. The title 'Son of David' is significant as it affirms their faith in Jesus' messianic identity.|
|MAT 20:32|And Jesus stood still and called them, saying, 'What do you want Me to do for you?'|In this verse, Jesus directly addresses the blind men, asking them what they desire. The use of 'what do you want' is an expression of His willingness to listen and respond to their needs. The phrase mirrors the themes found in verses about asking and receiving from God, emphasizing faith and desire for help.|
|MAT 20:33|They said to Him, 'Lord, let our eyes be opened.'|In this verse, the blind men directly address Jesus as 'Lord,' which emphasizes their faith in His power to heal. The phrase 'that our eyes may be opened' conveys both a literal and metaphorical desire for enlightenment and healing.|
|MAT 20:34|Moved with compassion, Jesus touched their eyes; immediately their sight was restored, and they followed Him.|The phrase 'σπλαγχνισθεὶς' conveys deep compassion, and the verb 'ἥψατο' indicates a physical touch. In this context, Jesus's action of touching their eyes signifies not just healing, but also a profound act of compassion that results in immediate restoration of sight. This emphasizes both His power and His mercy.|
