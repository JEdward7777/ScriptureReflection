The reference to the kingdom of heaven indicates a future hope and present reality for such individuals.|
|MAT 5:4|Blessed are those who mourn, for they shall be comforted.|This verse speaks to the comforting nature of God for those who experience deep sorrow. The word 'mourning' conveys a sense of loss and grief, while 'comforted' suggests the restoration of hope and joy. In this context, mourning is not just about sadness, but a deep longing for consolation and peace.|
|MAT 5:5|Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the earth.|In this verse, the term 'meek' or 'gentle' reflects a humble disposition that is gentle in spirit rather than weak. It suggests a trust in God and an assurance of inheritance not based on worldly power but divine promise.|

The phrase 'they shall be called sons of God' suggests a familial relationship and recognition that comes from embodying God's peace.|
|MAT 5:10|Blessed are those who are persecuted because of righteousness, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.|The term 'blessed' (μακάριοι) signifies a state of divine favor and joy. The phrase 'for righteousness' sake' emphasizes the motivation behind the persecution, indicating that those who suffer for doing what is right will find favor in God's eyes. The assurance of 'the kingdom of heaven' reflects the ultimate reward awaiting those who endure such trials.|
|MAT 5:11|Blessed are you when they revile you and persecute you, and say all kinds of evil against you falsely for My sake.|The term 'blessed' translates the Greek 'μακάριοι', indicating a state of divine favor. The use of 'when' in this context underscores the inevitability of persecution for believers. 'Reproach' and 'falsehood' are critical themes, emphasizing the spiritual integrity of the one persecuted for Christ's sake. This translation aims to preserve the original intent and gravity of the statement while making it accessible to contemporary readers.|
|MAT 5:12|Rejoice and be exceedingly glad, for your reward is great in heaven; for so they persecuted the prophets who were before you.|This translation emphasizes the call to joy amidst suffering, reflecting the promise of reward in heaven.

|MAT 5:13|You are the salt of the earth; but if the salt should lose its flavor, with what shall it be salted? It is no longer good for anything except to be thrown out and trampled underfoot by men.|In this translation, I have sought to capture the essence of the metaphor used by Jesus regarding the role of believers as 'salt.' The imagery is potent, implying preservation, flavor, and value. The phrase 'if the salt loses its flavor' captures the gravity of losing one's effectiveness as a witness. The concluding thought about being cast out and trampled reflects the serious consequences of such loss.|
|MAT 5:14|You are the light of the world. A city set on a hill cannot be hidden.|The phrase 'you are the light of the world' establishes the identity of believers as representatives of God's light, symbolizing truth and moral clarity in a dark world. The imagery of a city on a hill emphasizes visibility and the idea that true light cannot be hidden, aligning with the biblical theme of bearing witness to God's presence.|
|MAT 5:15|Neither do they light a lamp and place it under a basket, but on a lampstand, and it gives light to all who are in the house.|In this verse, the metaphor of light is emphasized, showing its purpose of illuminating the space around it. The imagery of a lamp and its placement serves to illustrate how Christians are to reflect the light of Christ in their lives, openly and for the benefit of others, rather than concealing it.|
|MAT 5:16|In the same way, let your light shine before others, so that they may see your good works and give glory to your Father who is in heaven.|This translation emphasizes the visibility and purpose of the believer's good deeds, aiming to reflect the intention of Christ's message: that others may recognize the divine source of these actions and glorify God. The term 'shine' is used metaphorically to denote the moral and spiritual influence believers should have in their community.|
|MAT 5:17|Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them.|In this translation, I sought to reflect the intention of Christ in affirming the continuity of His mission with the law and the prophets. The Greek word "καταλῦσαι" (to destroy) and "πληρῶσαι" (to fulfill) emphasize the fulfillment aspect of Christ's ministry rather than its abrogation. The use of 'the Law' and 'the Prophets' specifically highlights the importance of these texts in understanding Jesus' mission and teachings.|
|MAT 5:18|Truly, I say to you, until heaven and earth pass away, not a single dot or stroke will disappear from the Law until all is accomplished.|This verse emphasizes the permanence and unchanging nature of God's Law in contrast to the temporary nature of the physical universe. The term 'jot' refers to the smallest letter in the Hebrew alphabet, and 'tittle' indicates a small stroke or point that differentiates letters, emphasizing even the minutiae of the Law will remain intact until all things are fulfilled.|
|MAT 5:19|Therefore, whoever relaxes one of the least of these commandments and teaches others to do the same will be called least in the kingdom of heaven; but whoever does them and teaches them will be called great in the kingdom of heaven.|This verse emphasizes the importance of obeying even the smallest commandments and the impact of teaching others. The terms 'least' and 'great' in the kingdom highlight the consequences of one's actions and teachings regarding God's commandments.|
|MAT 5:20|For I say to you that unless your righteousness surpasses that of the scribes and Pharisees, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven.|In this verse, Jesus emphasizes the necessity of a righteousness that exceeds that of the scribes and Pharisees. This reflects the deeper moral and spiritual requirements of God's kingdom, contrasting with a mere outward observance of the law. The phrase 'exceeds' implies an abundance and authenticity in righteousness that cannot be matched by superficial practices.|
|MAT 5:21|You have heard that it was said to the ancients, 'You shall not commit murder,' and whoever commits murder will be subject to judgment.|This verse introduces Jesus' teaching on the deeper implications of the commandment against murder, emphasizing not just the act of killing but the internal attitude of hatred that can lead to it. The context highlights a radical redefinition of righteousness in the Kingdom of Heaven.|
|MAT 5:22|But I say to you that everyone who is angry with his brother without cause shall be liable to judgment; and whoever says to his brother, 'You fool!' shall be liable to the council; and whoever says, 'You worthless one!' shall be liable to hellfire.|This verse highlights the seriousness of anger and derogatory speech, emphasizing that they can lead to judgment. The terms 'ἀδελφῷ' (brother) and 'ὀργιζόμενος' (angry) are crucial in understanding the relational aspect of this command. The use of 'ῥακά' and 'μωρέ' signifies contempt, illustrating the gravity of words used in conflict.|
|MAT 5:23|So if you are presenting your offering at the altar, and there remember that your brother has something against you,|This verse emphasizes the importance of reconciliation with others, particularly before engaging in acts of worship. It reflects the principle that relationships with others are significant in one's relationship with God. The phrase 'offer your gift' alludes to the practice of sacrificial giving, which is central to worship in the Jewish context.|
|MAT 5:24|Leave your gift there at the altar and first go and be reconciled to your brother; then come and offer your gift.|In this translation, I emphasized the urgency of reconciling with a brother before presenting an offering, reflecting the priority that Jesus places on relationships over ritual. The word 'dōron' is translated as 'offering', and 'diapragmateuō' is interpreted as a strong call to 'reconcile' rather than simply 'settle' disputes.|
|MAT 5:25|Agree with your adversary quickly, while you are on the way with him, lest your adversary deliver you to the judge, the judge hand you over to the officer, and you be thrown into prison.|In this translation, the emphasis is placed on the urgency of reconciliation and the serious consequences of unresolved disputes. The language aims to reflect the same directness and solemnity of the original Greek.|
|MAT 5:26|Truly, I say to you, you will not leave there until you have paid the very last penny.|This verse emphasizes the seriousness of debts and judgments in the context of interpersonal relationships. The term 'kodrantēn' (κονδράντην) refers to a very small coin, which highlights the idea of a minor debt that still has to be settled fully. The implication is about the finality and justice of God’s judgment regarding our accounts, echoing themes found in Matthew 18 and James 2.|
|MAT 5:27|You have heard that it was said, 'You shall not commit adultery.'|In this verse, the teaching of Jesus refers back to the commandment against adultery found in the Old Testament. The translation emphasizes the direct quotation of the command while retaining the gravity of the issue being addressed.|
|MAT 5:28|But I say to you that everyone who looks at a woman with the intention to lust for her has already committed adultery with her in his heart.|In this verse, the focus is on the inner thoughts and intentions of the heart rather than merely the act of adultery itself. The verb 'to look' carries a deeper meaning, indicating not just a casual glance but a purposeful gaze that leads to lust. This reflects the overarching theme of Jesus’ teaching on the importance of the heart's condition in moral and ethical behavior.|
|MAT 5:29|But if your right eye causes you to stumble, tear it out and throw it away. For it is better for you to lose one part of your body than for your whole body to be thrown into hell.|In this verse, Jesus emphasizes the seriousness of sin and the drastic measures one might take to avoid it. The use of 'right eye' symbolizes something precious that may lead to sin, and the instruction to remove it conveys the importance of prioritizing spiritual well-being over physical comfort.|
|MAT 5:30|And if your right hand causes you to stumble, cut it off and throw it away from you; for it is better for you to lose one of your members than for your whole body to be thrown into hell.|In this verse, the emphasis is on the drastic measures one must take to avoid sin. The hand, being symbolic of action, signifies any activity that leads to stumbling. The concept of hell (γέεννα) denotes a place of eternal separation from God, which serves as a severe warning against the consequences of sin.|
|MAT 5:31|It has been said, ‘Whoever divorces his wife must give her a written notice of divorce.’|This verse emphasizes the seriousness of divorce and reflects the cultural and legal norms of the time. The use of the term 'certificate of divorce' suggests a formal process which contrasts with contemporary understandings of marriage and divorce. The focus here is on the action of giving and receiving a certificate, indicating a break in the marital union.|
|MAT 5:32|But I say to you that whoever divorces his wife, except for reasons of sexual immorality, causes her to commit adultery, and whoever marries a divorced woman commits adultery.|In this verse, Jesus addresses the topic of divorce and its implications. The term 'porneia' refers specifically to sexual immorality, which is the only acceptable reason for divorce in this context. The translation aims to capture the seriousness of the consequences of divorce and remarriage as stated by Jesus.|
|MAT 5:33|Again, you have heard that it was said to the ancients, 'You shall not break your oaths, but you shall fulfill to the Lord your vows.'|This verse emphasizes the importance of fulfilling vows made to God, reflecting a serious attitude toward commitments. It also contrasts the cultural practices of the time regarding oaths and honesty.|
|MAT 5:34|But I say to you, do not swear at all; neither by heaven, for it is the throne of God,|In this verse, Jesus emphasizes the importance of honesty and integrity in speech, advising against making oaths that invoke the name of God or sacred things. The reference to heaven as God's throne adds gravity to the act of swearing. The focus is on maintaining truthfulness without the need for oaths.|
|MAT 5:35|And do not swear by the earth, for it is the footstool of His feet; nor by Jerusalem, for it is the city of the great King.|This translation emphasizes the reverence and holiness associated with swearing oaths by heavenly or earthly entities, reinforcing the idea that they are under God's dominion. It captures the original context and intent without replicating existing translations.|
|MAT 5:36|And do not swear by your head, for you cannot make one hair white or black.|In this verse, Jesus emphasizes the futility of swearing by one's head, highlighting the inability to control even a single hair on one's head. The essence of the teaching is about integrity in speech and the inherent limitations of human power.|
|MAT 5:37|Let your word be simply yes or no; anything more than this comes from the evil one.|This translation maintains the original's instruction for integrity in speech. The phrases 'yes' and 'no' emphasize the importance of straightforward communication without excessive swearing. The phrase 'what is more' translates the Greek 'τὸ δὲ περισσὸν' to reflect that any additional commitments beyond these simple affirmations are unnecessary and may lead to evil, staying true to the essence of Jesus' teaching.|
|MAT 5:38|You have heard that it was said, 'An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth.'|This verse is a direct reference to the Old Testament law concerning retribution, commonly known as 'lex talionis' or the law of retaliation. It signifies a standard of justice that is equitable but also limited in scope to prevent excessive punishment. The fresh translation maintains the core concept while framing it in a context that prepares the reader for the contrasting teachings that follow in the Sermon on the Mount.|
|MAT 5:39|But I say to you, do not resist the one who is evil; but if anyone slaps you on the right cheek, turn to him the other also.|This translation emphasizes the principle of non-resistance to evil and encourages an attitude of love and generosity, reflecting the radical teachings of Jesus regarding personal conflict.|
|MAT 5:40|And if anyone wants to sue you and take your tunic, let him have your cloak as well.|In this verse, the emphasis is on the radical nature of love and non-retaliation in the face of injustice. The language used reflects the cultural context of the time, where taking legal action against someone was common. Here, Jesus teaches about relinquishing rights and extending grace beyond expectations, which is a foundational principle of the Christian faith.|
|MAT 5:41|And whoever compels you to go one mile, go with him two.|The term 'ἀγγαρεύσει' relates to being compelled or forced to serve, as often experienced in the historical context of Roman rule. This verse emphasizes not only compliance but an attitude of generosity in the face of compulsion, urging the believer to go above and beyond what is asked of them.|
|MAT 5:42|Give to the one who asks of you, and do not turn away from the one who wants to borrow from you.|This translation seeks to capture the essence of Jesus' teaching on generosity and the spirit of giving in the face of demands or requests. The language is meant to reflect a contemporary yet reverent tone suitable for modern readers.|
|MAT 5:43|You have heard that it was said, 'You shall love your neighbor and hate your enemy.'|This verse emphasizes a contrast between common societal norms of loving one's neighbor and the more challenging call to love one's enemies. The translation seeks to retain the essence of the original Greek while making it clear for contemporary readers.|
|MAT 5:44|But I tell you, love your enemies, bless those who curse you, do good to those who hate you, and pray for those who persecute you.|This translation reflects the imperative nature of Christ's teaching, urging believers to actively love their enemies rather than merely refrain from hostility. It emphasizes the actions believers should take towards their enemies, including blessing, doing good, and praying for them.|
|MAT 5:45|so that you may be children of your Father in heaven. For He causes His sun to rise on both the evil and the good, and He sends rain on the righteous and the unrighteous.|In this verse, the emphasis is on reflecting the character of God, who is impartial and gracious to all people, as evident in the natural phenomena of the sun and rain. The use of 'sons of your Father' signifies a call to emulate God's love and kindness regardless of one's standing before Him.|
|MAT 5:46|For if you love those who love you, what reward do you have? Do not even tax collectors do the same?|In this verse, the emphasis is on the concept of love and the motivation behind our actions. The phrase 'love those who love you' highlights the common practice of reciprocal love. The rhetorical question regarding the reward for such love suggests that true virtue lies in loving those who cannot reciprocate. This is a call to a higher standard of love that reflects God's unconditional love for humanity.|
|MAT 5:47|And if you greet only your friends, what more are you doing than others? Do not even the tax collectors do the same?|In this verse, the contrast is drawn between the behavior of Jesus' followers and that of the tax collectors, highlighting a call for a higher standard of love and kindness that goes beyond mere social norms. The term 'friends' (φίλους) indicates a deeper, personal connection rather than a mere acquaintance, while 'tax collectors' (τελῶναι) were often viewed negatively in society, serving as a symbol for those considered morally corrupt.|
|MAT 5:48|Therefore, you are to be perfect, as your heavenly Father is perfect.|The term 'perfect' in this context reflects the Greek word 'τέλειοι' (teleioi), which conveys a sense of maturity, completeness, and moral integrity. It is an exhortation towards achieving a high standard of conduct and character, modeled after God’s own perfection.|
