|MAT 25:24|Then he who had received the one talent came forward and said, 'Master, I knew you to be a hard man, reaping where you did not sow and gathering where you scattered no seed.'|In this verse, the servant expresses a perception of the master as harsh and unjust. The key terms include 'harsh man' (σκληρός), 'reaping where I did not sow' (θερίζων ὅπου οὐκ ἔσπειρας), and 'gathering where I did not scatter' (συνάγων ὅθεν οὐ διεσκόρπισας). These concepts reflect a misunderstanding of the master's character and expectations, which adds depth to the parable's message about stewardship and accountability.|

The term 'talent' is understood as a weight of money, symbolizing both responsibility and opportunity in the context of stewardship. The phrase ‘to the one who has ten talents’ underscores the principle that those who are faithful with their resources will receive even more responsibility.|
|MAT 25:29|For to everyone who has, more will be given, and he will have an abundance; but from the one who does not have, even what he thinks he possesses will be taken away from him.|This verse emphasizes the principle of stewardship and divine reward based on the use of one's gifts and resources. It reflects a recurring biblical theme that those who responsibly manage what they have will receive more, while those who do not will lose even what they believe they possess.|
|MAT 25:30|And cast out the worthless servant into the outer darkness; there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.|This verse emphasizes the final judgment and the separation between faithful servants and those deemed worthless.
