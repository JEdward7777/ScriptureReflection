The terms 'foxes', 'birds', and 'Son of Man' carry deep symbolic meanings about belonging, security, and the itinerant life that Jesus embraced in His ministry. The phrase 'nowhere to lay His head' indicates a complete renunciation of worldly comforts for the sake of the Kingdom of God.|

Then He rose and rebuked the winds and the sea, and there was a great calm.|In this verse, Jesus addresses His disciples' fear and lack of faith amidst a perilous situation at sea. The Greek terms 'δειλοί' (cowardly) and 'ὀλιγόπιστοι' (of little faith) underscore the disciples' emotional state. The verbs 'ἐπετίμησε' (rebuked) and 'ἐγένετο' (became) depict His authoritative command over the natural elements, highlighting His divine power.|

The phrase 'ἀγέλη χοίρων πολλῶν' refers to 'a herd of many swine', which is crucial for understanding the cultural context of the passage.|

|MAT 8:34|And behold, all the people of the city came out to meet Jesus; and when they saw Him, they begged Him to depart from their region.|In this verse, the word 'city' is used to represent not just the physical space but the people within it. The phrase 'came out to meet' signifies an active participation from the citizens, indicating both curiosity and concern regarding Jesus' presence.
