| Reference | Verse | Translation Notes |
|:---------:|-------|-------------------|
|MAT 18:1|At that time, the disciples approached Jesus and asked, 'Who then is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven?'|This verse addresses the disciples' curiosity regarding status and greatness in the Kingdom of Heaven. The term 'greater' implies a question about hierarchy and authority, prompting Jesus to teach about humility and servanthood, which are core principles in the teachings of Christ.|
|MAT 18:2|And Jesus called a child to Him and set him in the midst of them.|This translation emphasizes the act of Jesus calling the child and placing him among the disciples, showcasing the importance of humility and childlike faith in the Kingdom of Heaven. The phrase 'called to him' indicates an invitation and intention behind Jesus' action.|
|MAT 18:3|Truly, I say to you, unless you turn and become like little children, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven.|This verse emphasizes the need for humility and a childlike attitude to enter the Kingdom of Heaven. The term 'child' symbolizes innocence and dependence, which contrasts with adult pride and self-sufficiency.|
|MAT 18:4|Therefore, whoever humbles himself like this child is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven.|In this translation, the essence of humility as related to childlike faith is emphasized. The word 'humble' is used consistently to convey the importance of lowering oneself, as modeled by children. The phrase 'in the kingdom of heaven' signifies a spiritual elevation linked to this humility.|
|MAT 18:5|And whoever receives a child like this in my name welcomes me.|In this verse, Jesus emphasizes the significance of receiving a humble child in His name, equating such an act with receiving Him. The use of the word 'receive' suggests acceptance and valuing of individuals who may be seen as insignificant by society. The phrase 'in my name' indicates that this act is done with the authority and recognition of Christ himself.|
|MAT 18:6|But whoever causes one of these little ones who believe in me to stumble, it would be better for him to have a heavy millstone hung around his neck and to be drowned in the depths of the sea.|In this verse, the term 'little ones' refers to those who believe in Jesus, emphasizing their vulnerability and the severe consequences for leading them astray. The imagery of a millstone reflects the weighty punishment for such actions, underscoring the seriousness with which Jesus views the responsibility of believers toward one another, especially toward the innocent or young in faith.|
|MAT 18:7|Woe to the world because of stumbling blocks! For it is necessary that stumbling blocks come; but woe to the person through whom the stumbling block comes!|In this verse, Jesus expresses deep sorrow for the world due to the inevitability of offenses or stumbling blocks that lead others to sin. However, He emphasizes a specific woe for the individual through whom such offenses come. The Greek word for 'scandal' implies a trap or a stumbling block that causes others to falter in their faith. The translation maintains the solemn warning and conveys the weight of accountability.|
|MAT 18:8|And if your hand or your foot causes you to stumble, cut it off and throw it away from you. It is better for you to enter life crippled or lame than to have two hands or two feet and be thrown into the eternal fire.|This verse emphasizes the extreme measures one should take to avoid sin, comparing it to the severity of losing a body part rather than facing eternal consequences. The metaphorical language reflects the gravity of spiritual integrity over physical existence.|
|MAT 18:9|And if your eye causes you to stumble, tear it out and throw it away. It is better for you to enter into life with one eye than to have two eyes and be thrown into the fiery hell.|This verse emphasizes the seriousness of sin and the radical measures one should take to avoid it, echoing similar sentiments found throughout scripture regarding temptation and moral integrity. The use of the term 'stumble' suggests both physical and spiritual pitfalls that lead away from righteousness.|
|MAT 18:10|Take heed that you do not despise one of these little ones; for I tell you that their angels in heaven always behold the face of my Father who is in heaven.|This verse emphasizes the significance of every individual, particularly those considered insignificant ('the little ones'), and it highlights the continuous attention of their angels before God, suggesting a protective and intercessory role. The language used evokes a sense of care and vigilance that God has over even the smallest in the faith community.|
|MAT 18:11|For the Son of Man has come to seek and save that which was lost.|This verse emphasizes the mission of Jesus, the Son of Man, to rescue those who have gone astray. The term 'lost' is used consistently throughout the New Testament to signify those who are in spiritual danger or separation from God, echoing the heart of Christ's redemptive purpose.|
|MAT 18:12|What do you think? If a man has a hundred sheep and one of them goes astray, will he not leave the ninety-nine on the mountains and go in search of the one that went astray?|This verse emphasizes the importance of every individual within the community of believers, illustrating the shepherd's dedication to seek out the one who has strayed. The imagery of the sheep represents the followers of Christ, highlighting both vulnerability and the shepherd's loving pursuit. The translation aims to maintain the original Greek's essence and intent.|
|MAT 18:13|And if he finds it, truly I say to you, he rejoices over it more than over the ninety-nine that did not go astray.|In this verse, the emphasis is on the joy of the shepherd upon finding the lost sheep, highlighting God's deep concern for individuals and His great love for each one. The phrase 'more than' conveys a comparison that underscores the value of the individual compared to the whole.|
|MAT 18:14|In the same way, it is not the will of your Father who is in heaven that one of these little ones should perish.|This verse emphasizes the heart of God's desire for His children, showing that He values each one and does not wish for any to be lost. The term 'little ones' often refers to the humble or those who are vulnerable in faith, and highlights God's protective nature towards them.|
|MAT 18:15|If your brother sins against you, go and tell him his fault, between you and him alone; if he listens to you, you have gained your brother.|This verse emphasizes the importance of personal and private confrontation in the context of reconciliation among believers. It suggests a step-by-step approach to resolving conflict, with the goal of restoration and the maintenance of community integrity. The phrase 'if your brother sins against you' indicates a personal grievance that requires attention. 'You have gained your brother' reflects the ultimate aim of bringing someone back into the fold, highlighting the communal aspect of Christian fellowship.|
|MAT 18:16|But if he does not listen, take one or two others along with you, that every word may be confirmed by the testimony of two or three witnesses.|This verse emphasizes the importance of establishing truth through the testimony of multiple witnesses, aligning with biblical principles of justice and accountability.|
|MAT 18:17|If he refuses to listen to them, tell it to the church; and if he refuses to listen even to the church, let him be to you as a Gentile and a tax collector.|In this verse, Jesus instructs on the proper protocol for addressing sin within the community of believers. The emphasis is on the authority of the church and the seriousness of rejecting counsel, equating such a person with a Gentile and a tax collector, who were often viewed as outsiders. The term 'church' here reflects the gathered community of believers and their collective authority to uphold the standards of faith and practice.|
|MAT 18:18|Truly, I say to you, whatever you bind on earth shall be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.|In this verse, Jesus speaks with authority about the power of binding and loosing. The terms 'bind' and 'loose' convey the actions of prohibiting and permitting within the community of believers, linking their decisions on earth to divine acknowledgment in heaven. This reflects the authority granted to the church and emphasizes the seriousness of communal decisions regarding sin and forgiveness.|
|MAT 18:19|Again, I tell you, if two of you agree on earth about anything they ask, it will be done for them by my Father in heaven.|In this verse, the emphasis is on the power of collective prayer and agreement among believers. The term 'agree' or 'unite' conveys the concept of harmony in prayerful requests, signifying a strong, faithful intention aligned with God's will. The reference to the Father in heaven underlines the divine authority behind the answered prayers.|
|MAT 18:20|For where two or three are gathered in my name, there am I among them.|In this verse, Jesus emphasizes the significance of gathering in His name, indicating that His presence is assured where believers unite in faith and purpose. The phrase 'in my name' indicates a relationship with Jesus that is both personal and communal. The reference to 'two or three' reflects the idea of minimal yet significant unity among His followers, consistent with the Jewish legal principle requiring two or three witnesses to establish a matter.|
|MAT 18:21|Then Peter came up to Him and said, 'Lord, how often shall my brother sin against me, and I forgive him? Up to seven times?'|In this verse, Peter approaches Jesus with a question about forgiveness. The term 'forgive' used here has the same connotation of mercy and grace found in other parts of scripture. The number 'seven' suggests completeness, and Peter's inquiry reflects a desire to understand the limits of forgiveness, indicating an expectation of boundaries.|
|MAT 18:22|Jesus said to him, "I do not say to you up to seven times, but up to seventy times seven."|In this verse, Jesus is emphasizing the boundless nature of forgiveness. The phrase 'up to seventy times seven' implies an unlimited extent of forgiveness, contrasting with Peter's suggestion of forgiving up to seven times, which was already considered generous.|
|MAT 18:23|Therefore, the kingdom of heaven may be compared to a king who wished to settle accounts with his servants.|In this translation, the term 'kingdom of heaven' is emphasized to reflect the majesty and authority associated with it. The phrase 'summon to account' reflects the action of a king seeking to settle matters with his servants, which conveys the accountability within the kingdom.|
|MAT 18:24|As he began to settle the accounts, one servant was brought to him who owed him ten thousand talents.|In this verse, the focus is on the initiation of the settling of accounts, highlighting the vast debt owed by the servant. The word 'myriads' is translated to emphasize the enormous nature of the debt, which is central to the parable's teaching about mercy and forgiveness.|
|MAT 18:25|But since he could not pay, his master commanded that he be sold, along with his wife and children, and all that he had, so that payment could be made.|This verse reflects the seriousness of debts in biblical times and highlights the dire consequences of inability to repay. The language is chosen to convey the weightiness of the master’s command in the context of justice and mercy.|
|MAT 18:26|Falling on his knees, the servant implored him, saying, 'Master, be patient with me, and I will repay you everything.'|In this verse, the servant humbly begs for patience and a second chance from his master. The terms 'have patience' and 'I will repay you' signify both the desperation of the servant and the hope for forgiveness and grace from the master. This verse underscores themes of mercy and repentance that are echoed in various parts of Scripture.|
|MAT 18:27|Moved with compassion, the master of that servant released him and forgave him the debt.|The verse emphasizes the lord's compassion and mercy towards the servant. The word 'σπλαγχνισθεὶς' (splagchnistheis) indicates deep compassion, often linked to one's innermost being. This can be reflected in the modern understanding of empathy and forgiveness.|
|MAT 18:28|But that servant went out and found one of his fellow servants who owed him a hundred denarii; and he seized him, choking him, saying, 'Pay back what you owe!'|This verse captures the immediate response of the forgiven servant towards a fellow servant. The key elements are the act of finding the fellow servant and the violent manner of his demand for repayment, illustrating the stark contrast to the mercy he just received. The term 'hundred denarii' is used to indicate a smaller debt compared to the much larger sum previously forgiven.|
|MAT 18:29|So his fellow servant fell down at his feet and begged him, saying, 'Be patient with me, and I will repay you all.'|In this verse, the pleading and humility of the servant is emphasized, capturing the essence of mercy and patience. The phrase 'have patience with me' reflects a deep plea for understanding and grace in the face of indebtedness. The context of debt and forgiveness highlights the importance of mercy among brethren.|
|MAT 18:30|But he refused and went away, and cast him into prison until he should pay back what was owed.|The Greek verb ἀπελθὼν indicates a decisive action by the servant, emphasizing his refusal to show mercy after having received it. The phrase εἰς φυλακὴν denotes the act of putting someone into prison, signifying both punishment and the refusal to forgive.|
|MAT 18:31|When his fellow servants saw what had happened, they were greatly distressed and went and reported to their lord all that had taken place.|This verse depicts the deep sorrow experienced by the fellow servants after witnessing the unjust treatment of their colleague. The original Greek emphasizes the intensity of their sadness and their decision to report the matter to their master, indicating a sense of injustice and communal responsibility.|
|MAT 18:32|Then his master summoned him and said to him, 'You wicked servant! I forgave you all that debt because you pleaded with me.'|In this verse, the master rebukes the servant for his wickedness after having shown him mercy.

The structure reflects the call for mutual compassion, aligning with the overall teaching of forgiveness prevalent in the Gospels.|
|MAT 18:34|And in anger, his master delivered him to the tormentors until he should repay all that was owed.|In this verse, the context emphasizes the serious consequences of not extending mercy as received. The word 'delivered' reflects the idea of handing over to punishment, and 'tormentors' conveys the severe nature of the judgment awaiting the unmerciful.|
|MAT 18:35|So likewise shall my heavenly Father do to you, if each of you from your heart does not forgive his brother his trespasses.|This verse emphasizes the importance of forgiving others from the heart, reflecting the essence of God's forgiveness towards us.
