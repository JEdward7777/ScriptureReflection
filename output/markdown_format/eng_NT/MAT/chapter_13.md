| Reference | Verse | Translation Notes |
|:---------:|-------|-------------------|
|MAT 13:1|On that same day, Jesus went out of the house and sat by the sea.|This verse sets the stage for the teachings that follow, emphasizing Jesus’ movement away from the house to the sea, which symbolizes a place of gathering and teaching. The term 'house' signifies His ministry within the community, while 'sea' denotes the vastness and openness of His message.|
|MAT 13:2|And great crowds gathered around Him, so that He got into a boat and sat down, while all the people stood on the shore.|In this translation, the emphasis is on the large gathering of people and the action of Jesus sitting down to teach. The word 'crowds' captures the multitude, while 'boat' denotes the vessel into which Jesus enters. The phrase 'by the shore' specifies the location of the crowd's gathering, akin to other verses where Jesus teaches from a boat or elevated place.|
|MAT 13:3|And He spoke to them many things in parables, saying: "Behold, a sower went out to sow."|In this translation, I emphasize the act of speaking and the nature of parables as a teaching tool used by Jesus. The phrase 'the sower' directly connects with agricultural imagery, which was familiar to the audience of the time.|
|MAT 13:4|And as he sowed, some seeds fell along the roadside, and the birds came and devoured them.|The phrase 'some seed fell by the wayside' is understood to indicate an area where the ground is hard and unyielding. This imagery represents those who do not allow the seed, representing the word of God, to take root in their hearts. The mention of birds eating the seed symbolizes how quickly the enemy can snatch away the truth from those who are not receptive.|
|MAT 13:5|Other seeds fell on rocky ground, where there was not much soil, and they sprang up quickly because they had no depth of earth.|The phrase 'fell on rocky ground' emphasizes the contrast between the different types of soil, illustrating the varying responses to the word of God. 'Not having much soil' indicates a lack of depth for the seed's growth, and the subsequent 'immediately sprang up' highlights the quick, but ultimately shallow response to the message.|
|MAT 13:6|But when the sun rose, they were scorched; and because they had no root, they withered away.|This verse highlights the consequence of a lack of deep roots, illustrating the necessity of spiritual depth and stability. The imagery of the sun and withering is a common biblical theme, representing trials and challenges faced by believers.|
|MAT 13:7|Others fell upon the thorns, and the thorns grew up and choked them.|The phrase 'ἀνέβησαν αἱ ἄκανθαι καὶ ἀπέπνιξαν αὐτά' is translated here to reflect the metaphor of thorns choking the seeds. The imagery is consistent throughout scripture, symbolizing distractions and burdens that hinder spiritual growth.|
|MAT 13:8|But others fell on the good soil and yielded fruit: some a hundredfold, some sixty, and some thirty.|In this verse, the emphasis is on the type of soil and the resulting fruit, indicating different yields of productivity. The 'good soil' metaphorically represents receptive hearts that bear varying degrees of fruitfulness, showing God's sovereignty and grace in producing results in believers' lives.|
|MAT 13:9|Whoever possesses ears to hear, let him listen attentively.|The phrase 'He who has ears to hear' emphasizes the importance of spiritual discernment and attentiveness to the message being delivered. This expression is commonly found in the teachings of Jesus and reflects an invitation to listeners to engage deeply with the teachings.|
|MAT 13:10|And the disciples approached Him, asking, 'Why do You speak to them in parables?'|In this verse, the disciples approach Jesus with a question about His use of parables. The phrasing emphasizes their curiosity and desire for understanding, which reflects the overall theme of seeking deeper knowledge in the teachings of Christ.|
|MAT 13:11|He answered them, 'To you it has been granted to understand the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, but to them it has not been granted.'|In this verse, the focus is on the divine prerogative to grant understanding of the mysteries of the kingdom to certain individuals. This reflects the theme of revelation that runs throughout the New Testament, emphasizing that comprehension of spiritual truths is a gift from God.|
|MAT 13:12|For to the one who has, more will be given, and he will have an abundance; but from the one who does not have, even what he thinks he has will be taken away.|This verse highlights a principle of abundance and scarcity regarding understanding and possession. It underscores that those who are receptive and open to understanding will receive even more, whereas those who are closed off or unresponsive will find what little they have taken away.|
|MAT 13:13|Therefore, I speak to them in parables, because seeing they do not see, and hearing they do not hear, nor do they understand.|In this verse, Jesus explains why He teaches in parables. The structure emphasizes the dual process of seeing and hearing without understanding, drawing on prophetic themes from the Old Testament. This emphasizes the spiritual blindness and deafness of those who do not receive His message.|
|MAT 13:14|In this way, the prophecy of Isaiah is fulfilled, which says: ‘You will listen and listen, yet will not comprehend; you will look and look, yet will not see.’|This verse captures the prophetic declaration of Isaiah, emphasizing the hardening of the people's hearts and their inability to comprehend the truth. The repetition of seeing and not seeing, hearing and not hearing, conveys a deep sense of spiritual blindness and deafness that leads to a lack of understanding.|
|MAT 13:15|For the heart of this people has grown callous, and their ears are hard of hearing, and they have closed their eyes; otherwise, they might see with their eyes and hear with their ears and understand with their heart and turn, and I would heal them.|This verse reflects a deep spiritual condition where the heart, ears, and eyes are metaphorically described as being unable to perceive the truth. The language used emphasizes a willful blindness and deafness to divine revelation, highlighting the consequences of a hardened heart.|
|MAT 13:16|But blessed are your eyes, for they see, and your ears, for they hear.|This verse highlights the blessedness of those who have the ability to perceive spiritual truths. The phrase 'blessed are your eyes' emphasizes the special favor given to those who can see and understand divine revelations, contrasting with the previous verse where the inability to perceive spiritual realities is lamented. The parallel structure with 'ears' underscores the importance of both seeing and hearing in grasping God's messages.|
|MAT 13:17|Truly, I say to you, many prophets and righteous people longed to see what you see, and did not see it, and to hear what you hear, and did not hear it.|This verse emphasizes the privilege of the disciples in witnessing the fulfillment of the prophetic words that others had longed to see. The focus is on the blessedness of their experience and the historical longing of past prophets and righteous individuals.|
|MAT 13:18|Therefore, hear the meaning of the parable of the sower.|This translation emphasizes the importance of listening to the message conveyed in the parable of the sower, linking it to the active engagement of the audience. The phrase captures the urgency and significance of the teaching being presented by Jesus.|
|MAT 13:19|When anyone hears the message of the kingdom and does not grasp it, the evil one comes and snatches away what was sown in his heart. This is the seed sown along the path.|The phrase 'the evil one' refers specifically to Satan, who is active in thwarting the reception of God's word. 'The seed sown in the heart' denotes the word of God that is intended to take root and bear fruit, but fails to do so because of a lack of understanding.|
|MAT 13:20|But the one sown on rocky ground is the one who hears the word and immediately receives it with joy.|This verse depicts the response of an individual who hears the Gospel message and accepts it with immediate joy, highlighting both the excitement of receiving the message and the shallowness of that acceptance, as it lacks deep roots.|
|MAT 13:21|But he has no root in himself; he is temporary. And when tribulation or persecution arises because of the word, he is immediately offended.|This translation captures the essence of the original Greek text, emphasizing the lack of root in the person, the temporary nature of their faith, and the reaction to tribulation or persecution. The choice of words like 'root' and 'temporary' reflects the metaphorical language of the text, and the use of 'stumble' conveys the immediate impact of trials on faith.|
|MAT 13:22|But the one sown among thorns, this is he who hears the word; and the cares of this age and the deceitfulness of riches choke the word, and he becomes unfruitful.|This verse emphasizes the dangers of worldly concerns and the allure of wealth that can suffocate spiritual growth. It captures the essence of distraction and unfruitfulness in a believer's life.|
|MAT 13:23|But he who was sown on good soil, this is he who hears the word and understands it; who indeed bears fruit and produces, one a hundredfold, another sixty, and another thirty.|This verse highlights the fruitful response to God's word, illustrating the varying degrees of productivity in the life of a believer. The mention of 'good ground' signifies an open and receptive heart to the teachings of Jesus, while the numbers indicate the diversity in spiritual fruitfulness among believers.|
|MAT 13:24|Another parable He put before them, saying: ‘The Kingdom of Heaven is like a man who sowed good seed in his field.’|This verse introduces a parable that compares the Kingdom of Heaven to a man sowing good seed in his field, emphasizing the divine action of sowing and the inherent value of the seed itself, which symbolizes the Gospel and its effects on those who receive it.|
|MAT 13:25|But while everyone was sleeping, his enemy came and sowed weeds among the wheat, and went away.|This verse captures the subtlety of the enemy's actions, emphasizing the surprise of the enemy coming in the night, symbolizing stealth and malice. The term for 'weeds' (ζιζάνια) in this context can be interpreted as a metaphor for corruption or evil introduced into the good creation.|
|MAT 13:26|When the wheat sprouted and produced grain, then the weeds also appeared.|This verse emphasizes the visible result of the sowing process. The word ‘weeds’ (ζιζάνια) denotes the intrusive plants that grow among the good crop, revealing the coexistence of good and evil until the time of harvest. The structure aims to capture the tension between the growth of the wheat and the appearance of the weeds as a central theme in the parable.|
|MAT 13:27|Then the servants of the master came and said to him, ‘Sir, did you not sow good seed in your field? Where then did these weeds come from?’|In this translation, I aimed to maintain the urgency and concern expressed by the servants regarding the state of the field. The phrase 'good seed' is rendered directly to highlight the contrast with 'weeds.' The term 'master' reflects the authoritative relationship between the landowner and his servants.|
|MAT 13:28|But he said to them, ‘An enemy has done this.’ The servants then said to him, ‘Do you want us to go and gather them up?'|In this verse, the reference to the 'enemy' signifies an opposing force that introduces confusion and evil into the world. The term 'enemy' reflects the biblical theme of opposition to good, while the dialogue with the servants highlights a common question about the presence of evil in a world created by God for good.|
|MAT 13:29|But he said, ‘No, lest in gathering the weeds you uproot the wheat along with them.'|The Greek term 'ἐκριζώσητε' is translated as 'uproot', indicating the potential damage to the wheat during the process of removing the weeds. The emphasis in this verse is on the careful management of the harvest, showing the wisdom of restraint to avoid losing what is good while dealing with what is harmful.|
|MAT 13:30|Let both grow together until the harvest, and at the time of the harvest, I will say to the reapers: ‘First gather the weeds and bind them in bundles to be burned, but gather the wheat into my barn.'|This verse is part of a parable where Jesus explains the coexistence of good and evil until the final judgment. The imagery of gathering and burning reflects the ultimate separation of the righteous from the wicked at the time of harvest.|
|MAT 13:31|He presented to them another parable, saying: ‘The kingdom of heaven is like a mustard seed, which a man took and sowed in his field;'|In this verse, the metaphor of the mustard seed signifies the small beginnings of the kingdom of heaven, highlighting how something seemingly insignificant can grow into something significant. The use of the phrase 'in his field' indicates the personal aspect of this parable, illustrating the direct action of an individual in planting seeds of faith in their own life or community.|
|MAT 13:32|which is the smallest of all seeds; but when it has grown, it is larger than all the garden plants and becomes a tree, so that the birds of the air come and make nests in its branches.|This verse emphasizes the contrasting nature of the mustard seed, illustrating how something small can grow to greatness. The metaphor relates to the Kingdom of Heaven, showing its humble beginnings and expansive potential.|
|MAT 13:33|He spoke another parable to them: "The Kingdom of Heaven is like yeast that a woman took and hid in three measures of flour, until it was all leavened."|In this verse, the imagery of leaven (or yeast) is used to illustrate how the Kingdom of Heaven permeates and transforms everything it touches, much like leaven influences dough. The number three, used here, represents completeness or fullness, enhancing the idea that the Kingdom of Heaven is fully capable of transforming the world.|
|MAT 13:34|All these things Jesus spoke to the crowds in parables; and without a parable He did not speak to them.|In this verse, the focus is on Jesus teaching through parables to convey deeper spiritual truths to the crowds. The phrase 'He spoke' indicates the manner of communication, emphasizing that parables were His primary teaching method to explain the mysteries of the Kingdom. The expression 'without a parable' highlights the exclusivity of His method in dealing with the crowds, reinforcing the significance of the parabolic teaching style.|
|MAT 13:35|so that what was spoken through the prophet might be fulfilled, saying: 'I will open my mouth in parables; I will proclaim things hidden since the foundation of the world.'|In this translation, the phrase 'that which was spoken' is emphasized to reflect the prophetic nature of Jesus' teachings, echoing the style of Old Testament prophecies. The term 'in parables' has been retained to underscore the method Jesus used to convey deeper truths, while 'from the foundation of the world' connects to the eternal wisdom of God and the hidden truths revealed in Christ.|
|MAT 13:36|Then, leaving the crowds, He went into the house. And His disciples approached Him, saying, "Please explain to us the parable of the tares of the field."|This verse captures the moment when Jesus transitions from teaching the crowds to explaining the parable privately to His disciples. The use of 'house' indicates a more intimate setting for deeper understanding, while 'parable of the tares' (or 'weeds') suggests a complex teaching about the coexistence of good and evil in the world.|
|MAT 13:37|He answered and said to them, 'The one who sows the good seed is the Son of Man.'|In this verse, the term 'the sower' is identified as 'the Son of Man,' a title that emphasizes the dual nature of Jesus as both divine and human. The choice of the phrase 'the good seed' aligns with the theme of purity and divine origin of the message He imparts. The translation seeks to maintain fidelity to the original Greek while ensuring clarity for modern readers.|
|MAT 13:38|The field is the world; the good seed are the children of the kingdom, but the tares are the children of the wicked one.|This verse establishes the metaphorical significance of the world as a field, where good and evil are represented by the sons of the kingdom and the sons of the evil one respectively. The terms 'world', 'good seed', and 'sons' carry significant theological weight, highlighting the duality present in the created order.|
|MAT 13:39|The enemy who sowed them is the devil; the harvest is the end of the age, and the reapers are angels.|This translation aims to clarify the roles of the devil and the angels at the end of the age, while using terminology consistent with traditional Christian understanding. The phrase 'the enemy who sowed them' clearly identifies the devil as the source of evil in the world, linking the parable directly to spiritual warfare.|

The actions of the man finding the treasure illustrate the joy and commitment one should have towards obtaining it. The cultural context suggests that finding hidden treasure was a relatable scenario, reinforcing the value of the Kingdom of Heaven in contrast to earthly possessions.|
|MAT 13:45|Again, the Kingdom of Heaven is like a merchant seeking beautiful pearls.|This translation emphasizes the active pursuit of valuable spiritual truths and the sacrificial nature of the commitment required to attain them. The term 'merchant' signifies someone who is discerning and searching for true worth, drawing a parallel to the importance of seeking the Kingdom of Heaven.|
|MAT 13:46|Who, upon finding one priceless pearl, went away and sold all that he had to purchase it.|This translation seeks to convey the value and sacrifice represented in the parable of the pearl. The word 'merchant' suggests intentionality in seeking something of great worth, while 'pearl' symbolizes the Kingdom of Heaven's unparalleled value, warranting everything one possesses to obtain it.|
|MAT 13:47|Again, the Kingdom of Heaven is like a net that was thrown into the sea and gathered fish of every kind.|This verse illustrates the nature of the Kingdom of Heaven by comparing it to a net cast into the sea that collects fish of various kinds. It highlights the inclusivity and the gathering aspect of the Kingdom, emphasizing that it brings together diverse peoples, similar to how fish of different kinds are caught together.|
|MAT 13:48|When it was full, the fishermen brought it ashore; sitting down, they collected the good fish into containers, but threw away the bad.|This verse metaphorically describes the process of sorting good from bad, akin to the way fishermen separate their catch. The use of 'good' and 'bad' here resonates with the themes of judgment and discernment found in other scriptural contexts, indicating a final reckoning or evaluation of worthiness.|
|MAT 13:49|So it will be at the end of the age: the angels will come forth and separate the wicked from among the righteous.|The phrase 'at the end of the age' is a significant eschatological term, referring to the final judgment.

|MAT 13:50|And they will throw them into the fiery furnace; there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.|In this verse, the imagery of being cast into the fiery furnace emphasizes the finality of judgment and the intense suffering of separation from God. The 'weeping' and 'gnashing of teeth' depict the profound regret and pain of those judged. This fresh translation seeks to reflect the gravity of this fate while staying true to the original text's intention.|
|MAT 13:51|Jesus said to them, "Have you understood all these things?" They answered Him, "Yes, Lord."|In this verse, Jesus is asking His disciples if they have understood the teachings He has just shared, emphasizing the importance of comprehension in spiritual matters. The response 'Yes, Lord' indicates their affirmation of understanding.|
|MAT 13:52|And He said to them, "Therefore, every scribe instructed concerning the kingdom of heaven is like a householder who brings out of his treasure things new and old."|In this verse, Jesus compares a learned scribe in the kingdom of heaven to a householder.

|MAT 13:54|And coming to His own hometown, He taught them in their synagogue, so that they were astonished and said, Where did this man get this wisdom and these miraculous powers?|This verse highlights the amazement of the people in Jesus' hometown as they confront His wisdom and miraculous powers. The use of 'wisdom' and 'miracles' (or 'powers') indicates their struggle to reconcile Jesus' humble beginnings with His extraordinary abilities. The word 'wondered' implies a mix of admiration and disbelief, reflecting their familiarity with Him as the carpenter's son.|
|MAT 13:55|Isn't this the son of the carpenter? Isn't His mother called Mary, and aren't His brothers James, Joseph, Simon, and Judas?|In this verse, the people of Nazareth are questioning Jesus' authority by pointing to His humble origins as the son of a carpenter and mentioning His family, including His mother and brothers. The use of 'carpenter' reflects His earthly profession, emphasizing the contrast between His humble background and His extraordinary wisdom and powers. This is crucial to understand the skepticism that the townsfolk exhibit towards Him.|
|MAT 13:56|And are not all His sisters here with us? Where then did this man get all these things?|In this verse, the question highlights the familiarity of Jesus' earthly family and the astonishment of those hearing Him. The use of 'sisters' alongside 'brothers' emphasizes His family ties, while the questioning of His authority is seen in the phrase 'from where then does this man have all these things?'. This fresh translation aims to capture the relational dynamics and incredulity of the onlookers.|
|MAT 13:57|And they took offense at Him. But Jesus said to them, 'A prophet is not without honor except in his own country and in his own house.'|In this translation, the emphasis is placed on the notion of offense taken at Jesus by those familiar with Him. The term 'offended' captures the essence of the original Greek 'ἐσκανδαλίζοντο', which denotes being scandalized or stumbling over Him due to preconceived notions. Additionally, the phrase 'a prophet without honor' is a direct translation that underscores the theme of rejection experienced by prophets in their own communities.|
|MAT 13:58|And He did not perform many miracles there because of their unbelief.|This verse emphasizes the limitation of Jesus' miracles due to the lack of faith among the people. The term 'unbelief' reflects the refusal to accept His authority and power, mirroring themes present in other scripture references where faith is pivotal for divine works.|
