The use of 'doubt' is crucial, as it indicates the necessity of a steadfast heart when approaching God with requests. The imagery of moving a mountain reinforces the idea that faith can overcome the greatest obstacles.|
|MAT 21:22|And whatever you ask in prayer, believing, you will receive.|In this translation, the focus is on the assurance of receiving what is asked for in prayer, emphasizing the importance of faith as a prerequisite.

They deliberated among themselves, saying, 'If we say, 'From heaven,' He will ask us, 'Why then did you not believe him?'|This verse captures the dilemma faced by the religious leaders regarding the authority of John the Baptist's baptism. The translation uses the word 'baptism' consistently to refer to John's ministry, preserving the original meaning while ensuring clarity in modern English.|
|MAT 21:26|But if we say, 'From men,' we fear the crowd, for they all regard John as a prophet.|This translation captures the hesitation of the religious leaders, reflecting their fear of public opinion and the popular regard for John the Baptist as a prophet.

The emphasis is on the expected reaction of the landowner to the wicked actions of the vinedressers.|
|MAT 21:41|They said to Him, 'He will bring those wretches to a miserable end, and lease the vineyard to other farmers who will give Him the fruits in their seasons.'|In this verse, the emphasis is on divine judgment and the transfer of stewardship.
