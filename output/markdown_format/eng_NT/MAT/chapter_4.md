|MAT 4:1|Then Jesus was led by the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted by the devil.|In this translation, 'led' is chosen to convey the active role of the Spirit in guiding Jesus to the wilderness, reflecting the idea of divine purpose in the trial He faces. The word 'wilderness' is retained to maintain the imagery of isolation and testing. The terms 'tempted' and 'devil' are used in their common English equivalents to communicate the essence of the passage clearly.|
|MAT 4:2|And after fasting for forty days and forty nights, He was hungry.|This translation seeks to capture the essence of Jesus’ experience of fasting in the wilderness. The Greek terms for 'fasting' (νηστεύσας) and 'days' (ἡμέρας) are highlighted to emphasize the act of fasting for a prolonged period. The structure mirrors the original Greek syntax to maintain the rhythm and meaning of the text.|
|MAT 4:3|And the tempter approached Him and said, 'If you are indeed the Son of God, command these stones to become bread.'|This verse depicts the tempter approaching Jesus during a moment of physical weakness and challenges His identity as the Son of God, emphasizing the relationship between identity and provision. The phrasing 'if you are the Son of God' is a direct challenge and implies doubt, which is consistent with the temptations faced by believers today.|
|MAT 4:4|But He answered and said, 'It is written, Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that comes forth from the mouth of God.'|In this verse, Jesus emphasizes the importance of spiritual sustenance over physical sustenance, highlighting that human life is sustained not just by physical food but by the divine guidance and truth spoken by God. The phrase 'every word that proceeds from the mouth of God' encapsulates the idea of God's ongoing revelation to humanity.|
|MAT 4:5|Then the devil took Him to the holy city and set Him on the pinnacle of the temple.|In this verse, the devil takes Jesus to the 'holy city,' referring to Jerusalem, a significant spiritual location in the Jewish tradition. The term 'pterugion' is translated as 'pinnacle,' indicating a high point, typically referring to a prominent or elevated place, especially in the context of the Temple's structure.|
|MAT 4:6|And he said to Him, 'If you are the Son of God, throw yourself down; for it is written, ‘He will command His angels concerning you,’ and ‘They will lift you up in their hands, so that you will not strike your foot against a stone.’|This verse is a direct quotation from Scripture (specifically Psalm 91) used by Satan to challenge Jesus’ identity as the Son of God. The language reflects the tension between divine protection and the temptation to test God's faithfulness. It emphasizes the misunderstanding of scripture and the misuse of God’s promises when taken out of context.|
|MAT 4:7|Jesus said to him, 'It is also written: You shall not put the Lord your God to the test.'|This translation captures the essence of Jesus’ response to temptation, emphasizing the prohibition against testing God, which resonates through the Scriptures.

The verb 'showed' carries a connotation of revealing not just the visible but also the inherent value and allure of the kingdoms. The term 'glory' denotes not just majesty, but also the honor and reputation associated with earthly kingdoms.|

The use of 'shadow of death' further illustrates the gravity of their situation, suggesting a deliverance that is profound and transformative.|
|MAT 4:17|From that time on, Jesus began to preach and say, "Repent, for the kingdom of heaven has drawn near."|In this verse, Jesus begins His public ministry, emphasizing the necessity of repentance and announcing the proximity of the kingdom of heaven.
