| Reference | Verse | Translation Notes |
|:---------:|-------|-------------------|
|MAT 15:1|Then the scribes and Pharisees who were from Jerusalem came to Jesus, saying:|In this verse, the term 'scribes' and 'Pharisees' are significant figures in Jewish society and law. Their approach to Jesus reflects the tension between traditional religious authority and His emerging ministry. The phrase 'came to Jesus' highlights their confrontational approach.|
|MAT 15:2|Why do Your disciples break the tradition of the elders? For they do not wash their hands when they eat bread.|This verse emphasizes the conflict between Jesus and the Pharisees regarding the observance of traditions, particularly those concerning ceremonial cleanliness. The use of 'tradition' and the reference to 'elders' highlights the authoritative weight such practices held among the Jewish leaders, contrasting with Jesus' teachings and actions.|
|MAT 15:3|But He answered them, "And why do you also transgress the commandment of God because of your tradition?|In this verse, Jesus challenges the Pharisees regarding their traditions that contradict the commandments of God. The emphasis is on the conflict between human traditions and divine commandments, which is a recurring theme in the New Testament.|
|MAT 15:4|For God commanded, saying, 'Honor your father and your mother'; and, 'He who speaks evil of father or mother, let him be put to death.'|In this verse, the emphasis is placed on the divine commandment regarding honoring parents and the severe consequences of disrespect towards them. The translation captures both the direct speech of God and the significance of the command in terms of moral and spiritual obligations.|
|MAT 15:5|But you say, 'Whoever says to his father or mother, "Whatever help you might have received from me is a gift," does not honor his father or mother.'|In this verse, Jesus highlights a contradiction in the Pharisaic teaching that undermines the command to honor parents. The term 'gift' (δῶρον) suggests a devotion that could be used to neglect parental responsibility. The essence of the verse focuses on the idea that making a vow can lead to dishonoring one's parents, contrary to the original commandment.|
|MAT 15:6|Thus, you have nullified the command of God for the sake of your tradition.|The original Greek text emphasizes the invalidation of God's commandment through the adherence to human traditions. The word 'invalidated' suggests a more direct negation rather than simply setting aside, capturing the essence of the original intent behind Jesus' statement.|
|MAT 15:7|Hypocrites! Isaiah prophesied well about you, saying:|This translation reflects the admonition of Jesus toward the Pharisees, emphasizing their pretense and the fulfillment of prophecy by Isaiah. The term 'hypocrites' conveys a strong rebuke regarding their insincerity in worship.|
|MAT 15:8|This people draws near to me with their mouths and honors me with their lips, but their hearts are far removed from me.|This verse emphasizes the disconnect between outward expressions of faith and genuine heart devotion to God. The wording captures the essence of hypocritical worship, where lip service does not align with inner belief.|
|MAT 15:9|But in vain do they worship Me, teaching as doctrines the commandments of men.|In this verse, the emphasis is on the futility of worship that is merely outward, rooted in human traditions rather than true devotion to God. The phrase 'in vain' indicates that such worship does not please God. The mention of 'teaching as doctrines the commandments of men' highlights the contrast between God's commandments and human traditions.|
|MAT 15:10|And having summoned the crowd, He said to them, "Listen and understand."|In this verse, Jesus calls the crowd to listen and understand His teachings. The phrase 'ἀκούετε καὶ συνίετε' emphasizes both hearing and comprehending, which is significant in the context of the teachings about true worship versus traditions of men.|
|MAT 15:11|It is not what enters the mouth that defiles a person, but what comes out of the mouth; this is what defiles a person.|In this verse, Jesus emphasizes the distinction between what enters the mouth and what comes out of it, which speaks to the issue of true defilement. The Greek word 'κοινοῖ' translates to 'defile' or 'make common', emphasizing the moral implications of speech rather than dietary laws.|
|MAT 15:12|Then His disciples approached Him and said, 'Do You realize that the Pharisees were offended when they heard this saying?'|In this verse, the disciples express concern about the reaction of the Pharisees to Jesus’ teachings. The word 'scandalized' conveys the idea of being offended or disturbed by someone's words or actions, which is key to understanding the tension between Jesus and the religious leaders of the time.|
|MAT 15:13|But He answered and said, 'Every plant that My heavenly Father has not planted will be uprooted.'|In this verse, Jesus emphasizes the authority of God the Father in determining which 'plants' (or teachings) are valid. The metaphor of planting is used to illustrate divine approval versus human tradition. The phrase 'every plant' reflects a comprehensive scope, indicating that any teaching or doctrine not rooted in God's will is destined for removal.|
|MAT 15:14|Leave them alone; they are blind leaders of the blind. And if a blind man leads a blind man, both will fall into a pit.|In this verse, Jesus uses the metaphor of blind guides leading the blind to illustrate the danger of following false leaders. The imagery suggests that without proper spiritual sight, both the leaders and their followers will fall into destruction, as they cannot see where they are leading or where they are going.|
|MAT 15:15|Peter replied, "Please explain this parable to us."|The Greek phrase 'φράσον ἡμῖν τὴν παραβολὴν ταύτην' translates to 'explain to us this parable'. In this context, Peter is requesting clarity on the teaching that Jesus has just given. The choice of words here reflects the disciples' ongoing desire for understanding the deeper meanings of Jesus' parables.|
|MAT 15:16|But Jesus said, "Are you still so simple-minded?"|In this translation, I have aimed to capture the essence of Jesus' rebuke while ensuring clarity. The term 'simple-minded' is chosen to convey the notion of lacking understanding, reflecting the Greek word 'ἀσύνετος.'|
|MAT 15:17|Do you not yet understand that whatever enters the mouth goes into the stomach and is eliminated?|This verse emphasizes the distinction between external physical actions and the internal condition of the heart. It suggests that what enters the body through eating is not what defiles a person; rather, it is the state of one’s heart and intentions that matter. The context shows a teaching on purity and what is truly important in a believer's life.|
|MAT 15:18|But what comes out of the mouth proceeds from the heart, and this is what defiles a person.|This verse emphasizes the importance of the heart's intentions, showing that what emerges from a person's heart is what defiles them. It suggests a deeper moral and spiritual understanding of purity.|
|MAT 15:19|For out of the heart come evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, sexual immoralities, thefts, false testimonies, and blasphemies.|In this translation, I aim to convey the gravity of the sins listed and their origin in the human heart, reflecting the overall biblical view of the heart as the center of moral and spiritual life.|
|MAT 15:20|These are the things that defile a person; but to eat with unwashed hands does not defile him.|In this translation, the focus is on clarifying the meaning of what truly defiles a person. The phrase 'that which contaminates' emphasizes moral and spiritual corruption rather than merely physical acts. Additionally, the translation avoids the literal Greek phrasing while preserving the overall theological message that external actions alone do not determine one's spiritual state.|
|MAT 15:21|And Jesus departed from there and withdrew to the regions of Tyre and Sidon.|In this translation, 'departed' conveys the action of leaving a place, similar to the original Greek. 'Withdrew' and 'region' provide clarity in the modern context, ensuring the geographical significance of Tyre and Sidon is maintained. The text captures the essence of Jesus’ movement and his ministry's geographical boundaries without deviating from the scriptural integrity.|
|MAT 15:22|And behold, a Canaanite woman from those regions came out and cried out to him, saying, "Have mercy on me, Lord, Son of David; my daughter is severely tormented by a demon."|In this verse, the term 'Canaanite woman' reflects her ethnic background, while the plea for mercy emphasizes her desperation and recognition of Jesus as the Messiah, termed here as 'Son of David'. The phrase 'my daughter is severely demon-possessed' highlights both her anguish and the severity of her daughter's condition, indicating the urgent need for intervention.|
|MAT 15:23|But He did not answer her a word. And His disciples came and urged Him, saying, "Send her away, for she cries out after us."|In this verse, the response of Jesus to the woman's cry is significant, illustrating a moment of silence in the face of urgent plea, which is often interpreted as a test of faith. The use of 'he did not answer her a word' indicates not only a physical silence but a deeper spiritual context, where understanding and revelation may not come immediately.|
|MAT 15:24|But He answered and said, "I was sent only to the lost sheep of the house of Israel."|In this verse, Jesus emphasizes His primary mission to the lost sheep of Israel. The term 'lost' refers to those who are spiritually lost and in need of guidance and salvation. This reflects the broader theme of Jesus' ministry aimed at the Jewish people, while foreshadowing the eventual expansion of His message to all nations.|
|MAT 15:25|But she came and knelt before Him, saying, "Lord, help me!"|In this verse, the woman's act of worship signifies deep respect and desperation for help. The term 'Lord' used here emphasizes the recognition of Jesus' authority and divinity. The request for help ('βοήθει μοι') is a direct appeal that conveys urgency and faith in Jesus' ability to assist her.|
|MAT 15:26|But He answered, "It is not good to take the children's bread and throw it to the little dogs."|In this verse, Jesus responds to a Gentile woman who asks for help, using a metaphor that reflects the cultural understanding of the time regarding Jews (the children) and Gentiles (the dogs). The term 'dogs' here indicates a social barrier but also hints at the eventual inclusion of Gentiles in God's plan.|
|MAT 15:27|But she said, 'Yes, Lord; even the little dogs eat the crumbs that fall from their masters' table.'|This verse reflects the humility and faith of the woman as she acknowledges her lowly status while also asserting her right to receive mercy from Jesus. The imagery of dogs eating crumbs from the table emphasizes both the Jewish understanding of Gentiles and the universality of God's mercy.|
|MAT 15:28|Then Jesus answered her, 'O woman, great is your faith! Let it be done for you as you desire.' And her daughter was healed from that very hour.|In this passage, Jesus recognizes the great faith of the woman and responds to her plea. The phrase 'as you wish' reflects His willingness to grant her request based on her faith. The term 'daughter' is an affectionate reference that conveys care and acceptance. The healing takes place at that very moment, demonstrating Jesus' power and authority over illness.|
|MAT 15:29|And moving on from there, Jesus came by the Sea of Galilee, and after going up onto the mountain, He sat down there.|In this verse, Jesus transitions from a location to another near the Sea of Galilee and then ascends a mountain to sit down, which is significant as it indicates His role as a teacher and leader, often symbolized by elevated places. The words used in this verse reflect themes of movement, geographical features, and the posture of sitting as a sign of authority in teaching.|
|MAT 15:30|And great crowds came to Him, bringing with them the lame, the blind, the mute, the crippled, and many others; and they laid them down at Jesus’ feet, and He healed them.|The translation captures the essence of the original text by maintaining the specific conditions of the people who approached Jesus and emphasizing His miraculous healing. The choice of words like 'came to Him,' 'crippled,' 'blind,' and 'many others' reflects the severity of their conditions and the urgency of their need for healing. The phrase 'cast them at the feet of Jesus' highlights their desperation and faith in His power to heal.|
|MAT 15:31|So that the crowds marveled, seeing the mute speaking, the crippled healthy, the lame walking, and the blind seeing; and they glorified the God of Israel.|This translation emphasizes the astonishment of the crowds in response to the miraculous healings performed by Jesus. It reflects the joy and recognition of God's power in restoring health and sight, reinforcing the theme of divine intervention in the lives of those who suffer.|
|MAT 15:32|Then Jesus called His disciples to Him and said, 'I feel deep compassion for this crowd, for they have been with Me for three days and have nothing to eat. I do not want to send them away hungry, lest they faint on the journey.'|The phrase 'I have compassion' is translated from 'σπλαγχνίζομαι', which emphasizes a deep emotional response. The urgency of their need for food is highlighted by the context of having been with Him for three days. This translation aims to retain the depth of feeling expressed by Jesus while making it clear to modern readers.|
|MAT 15:33|And His disciples said to Him, 'Where could we find enough bread in this wilderness to satisfy such a great crowd?'|This verse reflects the disciples' concern about the practicality of feeding such a large crowd in a desolate area, showing their limited understanding of Jesus' miraculous ability. The term 'desolate' signifies a lack of resources, which is critical in understanding their dilemma. This translation aims to convey the urgency and disbelief expressed by the disciples in the context of a miraculous provision by Jesus.|
|MAT 15:34|And Jesus said to them, 'How many loaves do you have?' They replied, 'Seven, and a few small fish.'|This verse highlights the interaction between Jesus and His disciples regarding the provision of food. The number of loaves and fish mentioned sets the stage for the miraculous feeding to come. The use of 'seven' implies sufficiency and abundance, which is a common biblical motif.|
|MAT 15:35|And He commanded the crowds to sit down on the ground.|The original Greek phrase indicates a command to the crowd to rest on the ground. The term 'ἀναπεσεῖν' specifically suggests a relaxed or comfortable posture. This translation aims to capture that sense of inviting the crowd to rest.|
|MAT 15:36|And taking the seven loaves and the fish, He gave thanks, broke them, and gave them to His disciples, and the disciples distributed them to the crowds.|In this verse, Jesus demonstrates the act of giving thanks before breaking the bread and fish, highlighting the importance of gratitude in His ministry. The term 'blessed' can refer to both the act of thanksgiving and a spiritual blessing over the food. The phrase 'gave them to His disciples' emphasizes the role of the disciples as intermediaries in sharing God's provision with the crowd.|
|MAT 15:37|And they all ate and were filled, and they took up the leftover fragments, seven baskets full.|This translation aims to capture the essence of the original Greek text, focusing on the act of eating, being filled, and the gathering of leftovers, while maintaining a smooth and contemporary English flow.|
|MAT 15:38|Now those who ate were four thousand men, besides women and children.|The term 'four thousand men' is noted as distinct from women and children, emphasizing the count of the men alone, indicative of the larger multitude present. The phrase illustrates the significance of the feeding miracles that Jesus performed, providing context to the gathering of followers.|
|MAT 15:39|And after sending the crowds away, He got into the boat and went to the region of Magdala.|The phrase 'he sent away the crowds' is indicative of Jesus' authority over the multitude, similar to how he does so in earlier passages. The mention of entering a boat signifies a transition from one ministry opportunity to another as Jesus continues his travels. The geographical reference to Magdala gives context to His movements and teachings.|
