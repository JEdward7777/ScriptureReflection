The word 'simple' in this context implies sincerity or purity of intention rather than a lack of complexity.|

If then the light within you is darkness, how great is that darkness?|The term 'evil eye' (πονηρὸς) is understood metaphorically here, suggesting a disposition that is unhealthy or morally corrupt, which affects one's perspective and thereby the entirety of one's being (body).
