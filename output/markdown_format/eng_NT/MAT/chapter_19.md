|MAT 19:1|Now it came to pass, when Jesus had finished these sayings, He departed from Galilee and went to the borders of Judea, beyond the Jordan.|This verse marks a significant transition in Jesus' ministry as He leaves Galilee and heads towards Judea. The use of 'Galilee' and 'Jordan' provides geographical context, emphasizing the movement and purpose of His journey as He prepares for the events leading to His crucifixion.|

The verb 'ἐθεράπευσεν' signifies healing, pointing to His miraculous works and compassion for those who followed Him.|
|MAT 19:3|And the Pharisees approached Him, testing Him, and saying, ‘Is it permissible for a man to divorce his wife for any reason?’|This verse sets the stage for Jesus' teaching on divorce and the nature of marriage. The phrasing 'is it lawful' emphasizes the legalistic inquiry of the Pharisees, while 'for any cause' highlights the prevailing views on divorce in that culture. This translation aims to maintain the original intent while using contemporary language.|

|MAT 19:5|And for this reason, a man shall leave his father and mother and be united with his wife, and the two shall become one flesh.|The phrase 'leave... father and mother' emphasizes the priority of the marital relationship over parental bonds. The term 'joined' reflects the deep, covenantal connection that is established in marriage, aligning with the Biblical understanding of the union of husband and wife as sacred and integral to God's design.|
|MAT 19:6|So they are no longer two, but one flesh. Therefore, what God has joined together, let not man separate.|This translation emphasizes the divine intention behind marriage and the unity it creates, mirroring the original text's focus on the inseparable bond established by God. The phrase 'one flesh' signifies a deep and intimate connection, reinforcing the sacred nature of the marital relationship.|
|MAT 19:7|They said to Him, 'Why then did Moses command to give a certificate of divorce and to send her away?'|In this verse, the Pharisees refer to the law of Moses concerning divorce. The phrase 'certificate of divorce' (βιβλίον ἀποστασίου) reflects the legal process established in the Mosaic Law, which allowed a man to formalize a divorce. This context is crucial for understanding the debate on marriage and divorce that Jesus addresses.|
|MAT 19:8|He said to them, 'Moses permitted you to divorce your wives because of the hardness of your hearts; but it was not so from the beginning.'|In this verse, Jesus explains the reason behind Moses' permission for divorce, highlighting that it was due to the hardness of the people's hearts. The phrase 'from the beginning' emphasizes that God's original intent for marriage was different from what Moses allowed later.|
|MAT 19:9|And I say to you, whoever divorces his wife, except for the reason of sexual immorality, and marries another, commits adultery; and whoever marries a woman who has been divorced commits adultery.|In this verse, Jesus clearly outlines the exception for divorce as being tied to unchastity (πορνείᾳ), emphasizing the sanctity of marriage. The terms used convey the severity of the act of remarriage after divorce without proper grounds, equating it with adultery. The translation seeks to maintain the clarity and weight of the original message while ensuring it is comprehensible in contemporary English.|

The phrase 'it is better not to marry' reveals their view on the challenges of the marital relationship.|
|MAT 19:11|But He said to them, 'Not everyone can accept this teaching, but only those to whom it has been given.'|The phrase 'οὐ πάντες χωροῦσι τὸν λόγον τοῦτον' indicates that not everyone can accept or live by this teaching, suggesting that some have a specific calling or ability to understand and follow it. This is reflected in the use of 'gift' in related verses, which emphasizes the individual capacities given by God.|
|MAT 19:12|For there are eunuchs who were born so from their mother's womb, and there are eunuchs who were made eunuchs by men, and there are eunuchs who have made themselves eunuchs for the sake of the Kingdom of Heaven. He who is able to accept it, let him accept it.|This verse discusses the concept of eunuchs, both those born as such, those made eunuchs by others, and those who choose to live in celibacy for the sake of the Kingdom of Heaven. The term 'eunuch' here metaphorically represents those who live a life dedicated to God without the distraction of earthly relationships, especially marriage. It serves to highlight the seriousness and commitment involved in such a choice.|
|MAT 19:13|Then children were brought to Him so that He might lay His hands on them and pray; but the disciples rebuked them.|The term 'children' in this verse signifies not just infants but also represents those who are humble and innocent.

The disciples' rebuke of the children showcases a common tendency to prioritize adult matters over the needs of the innocent, a theme that is often addressed in the Gospels.|
|MAT 19:14|But Jesus said, "Let the little children come to me and do not hinder them, for the kingdom of heaven belongs to such as these."|In this verse, Jesus emphasizes the importance of children in the kingdom of heaven, reflecting His compassionate nature and welcoming attitude.

He also presents a conditional statement about entering eternal life, tying it to obedience to God's commandments.|
|MAT 19:18|He said to him, 'Which ones?' Jesus replied, 'You shall not murder, you shall not commit adultery, you shall not steal, you shall not bear false witness.'|In this verse, Jesus directly references several commandments from the Mosaic Law, emphasizing the importance of moral conduct.

|MAT 19:20|The young man said to Him, "I have observed all these things from my youth. What do I still lack?"|The phrase 'everything I have kept' reflects a sense of self-righteousness and adherence to the law that the young man believes he has achieved since his youth. The question 'what do I still lack?' reveals his inner search for something more than mere legalistic obedience.|
|MAT 19:21|Jesus said to him, 'If you wish to be perfect, go, sell your possessions and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; then come, follow me.'|In this verse, Jesus addresses the young man's desire for perfection by emphasizing the need for radical generosity and discipleship.

|MAT 19:24|Again I tell you, it is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than for a rich person to enter the kingdom of God.|This verse uses metaphorical language comparing the difficulty for a rich person to enter God's kingdom to a camel passing through the eye of a needle.

|MAT 19:28|And Jesus said to them, "Truly I say to you, that you who have followed Me will, in the regeneration, when the Son of Man sits on His glorious throne, also sit on twelve thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel."|This verse presents the promise of reward to those who have followed Jesus. The term 'παλιγγενεσία' refers to a renewal or restoration, indicating a future time of reward and judgment.
