| Reference | Verse | Translation Notes |
|:---------:|-------|-------------------|
|MAT 16:1|And the Pharisees and Sadducees came to Him, testing Him, and asked Him to show them a sign from heaven.|In this translation, the term 'sign' refers specifically to a miraculous indication or proof from heaven. The context highlights the confrontational approach of the Pharisees and Sadducees, illustrating their skepticism and desire for tangible evidence of divine authority.|
|MAT 16:2|But He answered them, 'When evening comes, you say, 'It will be fair weather, for the sky is red.'|In this verse, Jesus is responding to the Pharisees and Sadducees, highlighting their ability to interpret weather signs but their failure to recognize the spiritual signs around them. The term 'evening' in 'evening coming' is tied to the time of day when one can anticipate weather changes, which serves as a metaphor for discernment in recognizing God's works.|
|MAT 16:3|And in the morning, you say, 'Today will be stormy, for the sky is gloomy.' You know how to interpret the appearance of the sky, but you cannot discern the signs of the times.|In this verse, Jesus is rebuking the Pharisees and Sadducees for their inability to discern the spiritual significance of the times they were living in. The term 'hypocrites' (ὑποκριταί) signifies their double standards, where they can read the weather but fail to recognize the signs from God. This translation emphasizes the contrast between their earthly wisdom and spiritual ignorance.|
|MAT 16:4|A wicked and adulterous generation seeks for a sign, but no sign will be given to it, except for the sign of Jonah the prophet." And He left them and departed.|This verse emphasizes the frustration of Jesus with the unbelief of the people who are asking for a miraculous sign to validate His ministry. It reflects the prophetic tradition where signs were given but often rejected. The reference to 'the sign of Jonah' highlights the prophetic foreshadowing of Jesus’ death and resurrection, which will be the ultimate sign of His authority.|
|MAT 16:5|And when His disciples came to the other side, they had forgotten to bring bread.|This verse captures the moment when the disciples forgot to bring bread after their journey across the lake, highlighting a theme of physical needs and spiritual awareness, especially in the context of their ongoing learning from Jesus.|
|MAT 16:6|But Jesus said to them, "Take heed and beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees."|In this verse, Jesus warns His disciples about the influence of the Pharisees and Sadducees, using 'leaven' as a metaphor for their teachings. The context emphasizes the need for discernment against misleading doctrines.|
|MAT 16:7|But they were reasoning among themselves, saying, "It is because we brought no bread."|The word 'διαλογίζομαι' in the original Greek carries the sense of reasoning, debating, or considering among oneself. The phrase 'ὅτι ἄρτους οὐκ ἐλάβομεν' translates directly to 'that we did not receive any bread,' which indicates the disciples' concern over their lack of provisions. The emphasis in this verse is on the internal discussion and misinterpretation of Jesus' warning about the leaven, which reflects their spiritual blindness to the true message He was conveying.|
|MAT 16:8|But Jesus, aware of this, said to them, "Why are you discussing among yourselves about having no bread, O you of little faith?"|In this verse, Jesus addresses the disciples' lack of understanding and faith regarding His previous miracles, specifically their concern about bread. The term 'little faith' (ὀλιγόπιστοι) is a direct challenge to their faith and comprehension of His provision. The translation aims to convey Jesus' inquiry and the admonishment embedded in it.|
|MAT 16:9|Do you not yet understand or remember the five loaves of the five thousand, and how many baskets you took up?|This translation captures the essence of Jesus' rhetorical questioning about the miracles performed earlier, specifically referencing the five loaves provided to feed the multitude. The term 'do you not perceive' is emphasized to highlight their spiritual blindness despite witnessing miracles. The reference to 'baskets' reflects the Jewish custom of collecting remnants, symbolizing abundance and provision.|
|MAT 16:10|Nor the seven loaves from the four thousand, and how many baskets you gathered?|This verse refers to a specific incident in the Gospel narrative where the disciples are reminded of the miracles Jesus performed, emphasizing their lack of understanding regarding His power and provision. The use of 'seven loaves' and 'baskets' draws attention to the abundance that Jesus provided even when faced with limited resources.|
|MAT 16:11|How do you not understand that I was not speaking about bread? But beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees.|In this translation, the phrase is structured to maintain clarity while capturing the essence of Jesus’ teaching about spiritual awareness rather than focusing on physical sustenance. The term 'leaven' metaphorically refers to the corrupting influence of the Pharisees and Sadducees.|
|MAT 16:12|Then they understood that He was not warning them to beware of the leaven of bread, but of the teachings of the Pharisees and Sadducees.|In this verse, Jesus is clarifying His warning against the teachings of the Pharisees and Sadducees, which He refers to metaphorically as 'leaven.' The use of the term 'leaven' signifies the pervasive and corrupting influence of their doctrines. The emphasis is on understanding that His warning is spiritual rather than a literal concern about bread.|
|MAT 16:13|When Jesus came into the region of Caesarea Philippi, He asked His disciples, 'Who do people say that the Son of Man is?'|The verse captures a pivotal moment where Jesus probes His disciples about their understanding of His identity. The geographical reference to Caesarea Philippi sets a significant backdrop, as this location was known for its pagan worship and contrasts with the recognition of Jesus as the Messiah. The phrase 'Son of Man' carries deep messianic implications, referencing both His humanity and divine mission. The inquiry emphasizes the importance of personal belief and recognition in the faith journey.|
|MAT 16:14|And they said, 'Some say John the Baptist, others say Elijah, and still others say Jeremiah or one of the prophets.'|This verse indicates the varied opinions of the people about Jesus' identity, comparing Him to significant prophetic figures in Israel's history. The use of names like John, Elijah, and Jeremiah signifies the recognition of Jesus as a prophet, yet also shows the lack of understanding of His true nature as the Messiah.|
|MAT 16:15|But what about you? Who do you say I am?|In this verse, Jesus directly engages his disciples, prompting them to reflect on their personal understanding of his identity, contrasting with the public opinions stated previously. The phrasing 'Who do you say that I am?' conveys a more intimate and personal inquiry than simply asking for others' opinions, thereby emphasizing the importance of personal belief in Christ.|
|MAT 16:16|Simon Peter replied, 'You are the Messiah, the Son of the Living God.'|In this translation, the emphasis is on Peter's declaration of Jesus' identity as the Messiah and the Son of the Living God. The phrase 'Son of the Living God' is crucial as it underscores both divinity and relational closeness with God. The translation maintains a formal tone to reflect the original Greek text's reverence and clarity.|
|MAT 16:17|And Jesus answered him, 'Blessed are you, Simon Bar-Jonah, for flesh and blood has not revealed this to you, but my Father who is in heaven.'|In this translation, I emphasize the blessedness of Peter and the revelation he received, distinguishing between human understanding and divine insight. The use of 'flesh and blood' metaphorically indicates human reasoning, while 'my Father' refers to the divine source of revelation.|
|MAT 16:18|And I tell you that you are Peter, and on this rock, I will build my church, and the gates of hell will not prevail against it.|In this verse, Jesus declares Peter's identity as 'rock' and establishes the church upon him. The play on words with 'Peter' (Πέτρος, Petros) and 'rock' (πέτρᾳ, petra) is significant, highlighting Peter's foundational role in the establishment of the Church. The phrase 'gates of hell' indicates the enduring strength and resilience of the church against the forces of evil.|
|MAT 16:19|And I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven; whatever you bind on earth shall be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.|This translation captures the authority given to Peter concerning the keys of the kingdom, reflecting both the spiritual authority and the binding and loosing principle established in this verse. The parallel verses provide additional context about the authority over sin and spiritual matters.|
|MAT 16:20|Then He commanded His disciples not to tell anyone that He was the Christ.|In this verse, Jesus instructs His disciples to refrain from publicly declaring His identity as the Messiah, emphasizing the necessity of secrecy regarding His true nature at this stage in His ministry. The directive implies a deliberate control over the revelation of His messianic identity.|
|MAT 16:21|From that time onward, Jesus began to reveal to His disciples that He must go to Jerusalem and suffer many things from the elders, chief priests, and scribes, and be killed, and on the third day rise again.|In this verse, Jesus begins to explicitly inform His disciples about His impending suffering and death. Key elements include the necessity of His journey to Jerusalem and the suffering He is to endure at the hands of religious authorities, culminating in His resurrection on the third day. The word 'must' emphasizes the divine necessity of these events in salvation history.|
|MAT 16:22|And Peter took Him aside and began to sharply rebuke Him, saying, "God forbid, Lord; this shall never happen to You!"|This translation reflects Peter's emotional reaction and conveys his concern for Jesus' safety in a more vivid way, maintaining the intensity of his rebuke without losing the reverence he shows to Jesus as Lord.|
|MAT 16:23|But He turned and said to Peter, "Get behind Me, Satan! You are an offense to Me, for you are not mindful of the things of God, but the things of men."|This verse highlights the contrast between divine understanding and human reasoning. Jesus reprimands Peter for focusing on earthly concerns rather than the divine plan. The term 'Satan' in this context is used to signify opposition to God's will, and 'scandal' indicates that Peter's words could lead others astray.|
|MAT 16:24|Then Jesus said to His disciples, "If anyone wants to follow Me, let him deny himself, take up his cross, and follow Me."|This verse emphasizes the necessity of self-denial and commitment for those who wish to follow Jesus. The call to take up one’s cross signifies embracing challenges and sacrifices for the sake of discipleship, which aligns with the broader theme of commitment in the teachings of Jesus.|
|MAT 16:25|For whoever desires to save his life will lose it; but whoever loses his life for my sake will find it.|This verse emphasizes the paradox of gaining true life through self-sacrifice, particularly in the context of following Christ. The terms 'save' and 'lose' convey deep spiritual significance and invite reflection on the value of earthly versus eternal life.|
|MAT 16:26|For what will it profit a man if he gains the whole world but loses his own soul? Or what will a man give in exchange for his soul?|This verse emphasizes the futility of gaining worldly possessions at the cost of one’s soul. The use of 'world' signifies all earthly wealth and pleasures, while 'soul' denotes the eternal aspect of humanity. The rhetorical questions challenge the reader to consider the true value of life and what one might sacrifice for material gain.|
|MAT 16:27|For the Son of Man is about to come in the glory of His Father, accompanied by His angels, and then He will reward each person according to their deeds.|In this verse, the emphasis is on the return of the Son of Man and His coming in glory, accompanied by angels. The term 'the glory of His Father' indicates divine approval and majesty, while 'He will repay each according to his works' highlights the theme of divine judgment and justice.|
|MAT 16:28|Truly, I say to you, there are some standing here who will not taste death until they see the Son of Man coming in His kingdom.|This verse speaks of the assurance that certain individuals present at that time would witness the coming of the Son of Man in His kingdom before their physical death. The language emphasizes the reality of witnessing an important eschatological event, affirming the authority and presence of Christ.|
