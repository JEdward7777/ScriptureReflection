|MAT 2:1|Now after Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea in the days of King Herod, behold, wise men from the east came to Jerusalem.|In this translation, the emphasis is placed on the birthplace of Jesus, the presence of the Magi, and the historical context of King Herod. The term 'Magi' is used instead of 'wise men' to maintain a direct connection to the original text's use of the Greek word 'μάγοι'.

|MAT 2:2|saying, ‘Where is the one who has been born king of the Jews? For we have seen his star in the east and have come to worship him.’|The term 'born' emphasizes the incarnation, while 'king of the Jews' highlights the authority of Jesus. The phrase 'we saw his star' suggests divine guidance and recognition of Jesus's royal status. 'Come to worship' signifies the wise men's intent to honor him appropriately, which is consistent with the practice of bowing down before a sovereign.|

The phrase 'where the Christ is born' reflects the inquiry's essence and retains a clear connection to the Jewish expectation of the Messiah.|
|MAT 2:5|They replied, "In Bethlehem of Judea, for this is what has been written through the prophet:"|The verse succinctly states that the chief priests and scribes affirm Bethlehem in Judea as the birthplace of the Messiah, citing prophetic scripture. It uses simple language to convey the significance of Bethlehem as foretold by the prophets, maintaining a connection to Old Testament prophecy.|
|MAT 2:6|And you, Bethlehem, in the land of Judah, are by no means the least among the rulers of Judah; for out of you will come a leader who will shepherd my people Israel.|The verse is a prophecy regarding the birth of Christ, emphasizing the significance of Bethlehem as a humble yet pivotal location in God’s plan for Israel's leadership.|
|MAT 2:7|Then Herod secretly called for the Magi and ascertained from them the exact time the star had appeared.|In this translation, I focused on the verb 'to inquire' as it denotes a formal questioning, similar to seeking wisdom or truth. The term 'star' is emphasized to reflect its significant role in guiding the Magi.|
|MAT 2:8|And he sent them to Bethlehem, saying, 'Go and search diligently for the child; and when you find him, report back to me, so that I too may come and worship him.'|The verse emphasizes the calculated intention behind Herod's instructions to the Magi, reflecting both his desire to find the child and his ulterior motive of wishing to harm Him. The choice of words seeks to capture the sense of urgency and careful investigation implied in the Greek.|

And opening their treasures, they offered him gifts: gold, frankincense, and myrrh.|In this verse, the Magi's actions reflect their reverence and the act of worship towards Jesus, recognizing His royal status. The gifts presented—gold, frankincense, and myrrh—are significant both for their value and their symbolic meanings: gold representing royalty, frankincense symbolizing divinity, and myrrh prefiguring suffering and death.|

The phrase 'out of Egypt' refers back to God's deliverance of Israel, echoing the deep roots of the Hebrew scriptures in the Christian narrative. The use of 'the Lord' and 'the prophet' is consistent with how divine messages were conveyed in scripture, underscoring the fulfillment of prophecy.|

The phrase 'ἀκουσας' indicates Joseph’s response to news of Archelaus's rule, highlighting his apprehension, while 'χρηματισθείς' emphasizes the significance of divine direction through a dream. The decision to 'ἀνεχώρησεν' suggests a purposeful withdrawal, aligning with Joseph's character as a protector of his family.|
