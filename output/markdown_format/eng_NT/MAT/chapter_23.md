| Reference | Verse | Translation Notes |
|:---------:|-------|-------------------|
|MAT 23:1|Then Jesus spoke to the crowds and to His disciples.|This verse serves as an introduction to a discourse from Jesus, indicating the audience to whom He speaks. The use of 'crowds' and 'disciples' emphasizes the distinction between the general public and His closer followers, establishing a setting for the teachings that follow.|
|MAT 23:2|saying, 'The scribes and the Pharisees have taken their seat in the seat of Moses.'|This verse emphasizes the authority of the religious leaders of the time, specifically the scribes and Pharisees, as they teach from Moses' seat, indicating their role in interpreting the Law. It reflects the hierarchical structure of Jewish religious leadership during Jesus' ministry.|
|MAT 23:3|Therefore, all that they tell you to observe, you must keep and do; but do not follow their actions, for they say and do not practice.|In this verse, Jesus is instructing the people to adhere to the teachings of the religious leaders regarding the law, while warning them not to follow their hypocritical actions. The term 'keep' (τηρεῖτε) implies a careful observance, while 'do' (ποιεῖτε) emphasizes action based on true understanding and integrity. This verse captures the contrast between teaching and practice.|
|MAT 23:4|For they bind heavy and unbearable burdens and lay them on the shoulders of men, but they themselves do not lift a finger to move them.|In this translation, I emphasized the contrast between the heavy burdens imposed by the religious leaders and their unwillingness to help alleviate these burdens. The phrase 'with their finger' highlights the lack of genuine compassion and support from the leaders. The use of 'burden' aligns with the theme of weighty responsibilities in scripture, ensuring consistency with related verses.|
|MAT 23:5|But all their works they do to be seen by men. They broaden their phylacteries and lengthen the tassels of their garments.|This verse illustrates the hypocrisy of the Pharisees and their outward display of piety meant to gain public approval rather than true devotion to God. The use of terms like 'deeds', 'widening', and 'fringes' captures the essence of their actions meant for visibility rather than authenticity.|
|MAT 23:6|They love the places of honor at feasts and the best seats in the synagogues.|The term ' πρωτοκλισία' translates to 'chief seats' or 'places of honor', reflecting the desire for status and recognition. The use of ' πρωτοκαθεδρίας' similarly emphasizes a longing for prominent positions within the communal worship, showcasing a common theme of pride and aspiration for status among religious leaders.|
|MAT 23:7|and they love greetings in the marketplaces and to be called 'Rabbi' by others.|The verse emphasizes the desire for recognition and respect by using the title 'Rabbi.' The term indicates a position of authority and teaching, which was significant in the Jewish culture of the time. The fresh translation aims to capture both the literal meaning and the social implications of such titles.|
|MAT 23:8|But you are not to be called 'Rabbi,' for you have one Teacher, the Christ; and all of you are brothers.|In this translation, the emphasis is on the relationship believers share with one another and with Christ, rather than elevating titles or status. The term 'Rabbi' is specifically noted as an improper title for the disciples of Christ, stressing the equality of all believers as brothers.|
|MAT 23:9|And do not call anyone on earth your father, for you have one Father, who is in heaven.|The term 'father' here emphasizes the unique and divine relationship believers have with God, contrasting with the earthly titles that may lead to pride or authority struggles among people. The translation maintains the singular focus on God as the Father, highlighting His position as the ultimate source of spiritual authority.|
|MAT 23:10|And do not be called teachers, for you have one Teacher, the Christ.|The term 'καθηγηταί' refers to teachers or instructors, emphasizing the singular authority of Christ as the ultimate teacher. This verse aligns with the broader theme of humility and the rejection of hierarchical titles in the Christian community.|
|MAT 23:11|But the greatest among you shall be your servant.|In this verse, Jesus emphasizes the value of servanthood in contrast to seeking positions of power or authority. The term 'διάκονος' specifically refers to a servant or minister, highlighting the calling to serve others as a hallmark of true greatness in the Kingdom of Heaven.|
|MAT 23:12|Whoever exalts himself will be humbled, and whoever humbles himself will be exalted.|This verse emphasizes the theme of humility versus pride, a common teaching in the teachings of Jesus. The structure reflects a parallelism between the actions of exalting and humbling oneself, presenting a clear moral lesson about the reversal of fortunes in the kingdom of God.|
|MAT 23:13|Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you devour the houses of widows, and for a show make long prayers. Therefore, you will receive the greater judgment.|This verse addresses the hypocrisy of the scribes and Pharisees, emphasizing their exploitation of vulnerable individuals, specifically widows. The use of 'woe' indicates a strong denunciation, while 'hypocrites' underscores the contrast between their outward piety and inward wrongdoing. The phrase 'long prayers' serves to highlight their pretense rather than genuine devotion. The warning of 'greater condemnation' reflects the serious consequences of their actions.|
|MAT 23:14|Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you shut the kingdom of heaven in front of men; for you do not enter yourselves, nor do you allow those who are entering to go in.|In this translation, I aim to capture the strong rebuke Jesus offers to the scribes and Pharisees for their hypocrisy, as well as the warning about their hindrance to others seeking the kingdom of heaven. The terms 'woe', 'scribes', 'Pharisees', and 'kingdom of heaven' are critical to understanding the passage's message.|
|MAT 23:15|Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you traverse land and sea to make one proselyte, and when he is made, you make him twice as much a son of hell as yourselves.|In this verse, Jesus criticizes the religious leaders for their zealous but misguided efforts to convert others, highlighting the detrimental effect of their hypocrisy. The term 'proselyte' refers to a convert to Judaism, and 'son of hell' conveys the idea of leading others to a worse spiritual state. The structure of the original Greek emphasizes their intense effort contrasted with their ultimate failure to lead others toward true faith.|
|MAT 23:16|Woe to you, blind guides! For you say, 'Whoever swears by the temple, it is nothing; but whoever swears by the gold of the temple is obligated.'|In this verse, Jesus condemns the blind guides for their misinterpretation of oaths. The term 'blind guides' highlights their lack of spiritual insight, while the reference to swearing in the temple and by the gold of the temple indicates their focus on material rather than spiritual matters. This translation aims to capture the essence of Jesus' rebuke with clarity and fidelity to the original Greek.|
|MAT 23:17|Foolish and blind! Which is greater, the gold or the temple that sanctifies the gold?|In this verse, Jesus highlights the folly of prioritizing material wealth (the gold) over the sacredness of the temple itself. The contrast is crucial to understanding His critique of the religious leaders' misplaced values.|
|MAT 23:18|And whoever swears by the altar, it means nothing; but whoever swears by the gift that is upon it, is bound by his oath.|This verse highlights the absurdity of the distinctions made by the Pharisees regarding oaths and what makes them binding. It emphasizes the importance of integrity and the weight of the commitments one makes, particularly when invoking sacred elements such as the altar and gifts on it.|
|MAT 23:19|You foolish and blind! For which is greater, the gift or the altar that sanctifies the gift?|This verse contrasts the value of the gift versus the altar, emphasizing the sanctifying role of the altar. The phrasing captures the astonishment at the misplaced priorities of the audience regarding sacred matters. It highlights a common theme in Matthew of understanding the heart of God's commands rather than mere ritual adherence.|
|MAT 23:20|Therefore, the one who swears by the altar swears by it and by everything upon it.|This verse emphasizes the seriousness of oaths taken in the context of the temple, implying that swearing by the altar carries the same weight as swearing by the gifts offered upon it. The choice of words is crucial to convey the religious importance of these actions in Jewish tradition.|
|MAT 23:21|And he who swears by the temple swears by it and by Him who dwells in it.|This verse emphasizes the seriousness of oaths, particularly in relation to the sanctuary and the presence of God. The structure mirrors the reverence seen in ancient Jewish practices concerning vows made in holy spaces.|
|MAT 23:22|And he who swears by heaven swears by the throne of God and by Him who sits upon it.|In this translation, the term 'swears' emphasizes the seriousness of making an oath, particularly as it pertains to the heavenly realm. The phrase 'in heaven' is directly linked to 'the throne of God', underscoring the sacredness associated with invoking God's name. The mention of 'the one seated above it' refers to God's sovereignty and majesty.|
|MAT 23:23|Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you meticulously tithe mint, dill, and cumin, but you have overlooked the weightier matters of the law: justice, mercy, and faith. It is these you ought to have practiced, without neglecting the others.|In this translation, I have chosen to emphasize the importance of not neglecting the core principles of justice, mercy, and faith, which Jesus highlights in contrast to the meticulous adherence to the law's lesser details. This reflects the original Greek text's intention, maintaining a clear distinction between essential and non-essential observances.|
|MAT 23:24|Blind guides! You strain out a gnat but swallow a camel!|In this verse, Jesus is criticizing the religious leaders for their hypocrisy and misplaced priorities. The metaphor of straining out a gnat while swallowing a camel emphasizes their focus on minor issues at the expense of significant moral truths. The choice of words highlights the absurdity of their actions, using animals that represent purity (gnat) and impurity (camel) in Jewish law.|
|MAT 23:25|Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you clean the outside of the cup and the plate, but inside they are full of extortion and injustice.|In this verse, Jesus addresses the Pharisees and scribes, criticizing them for their hypocrisy. The phrase 'clean the outside' symbolizes their focus on outward appearances and rituals rather than inner purity and righteousness. The terms 'greed' and 'wickedness' point to the moral corruption that resides within, which contradicts their external practices.|
|MAT 23:26|You blind Pharisee! First cleanse the inside of the cup and the dish, so that the outside may also become clean.|In this verse, Jesus emphasizes the need for inner purity over mere external appearances. The Greek word for 'clean' (καθάρισον) is used to indicate a thorough cleansing that originates from within, reflecting the overarching biblical theme that true righteousness begins in the heart.|
|MAT 23:27|Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you are like whitewashed tombs, which indeed appear beautiful outwardly, but inside are full of dead bones and all uncleanness.|In this verse, Jesus uses the metaphor of tombs to illustrate the hypocrisy of the scribes and Pharisees. The emphasis is on their outward appearance of righteousness contrasted with their inner corruption, much like the whitewashed tombs that look beautiful from the outside but contain death and decay within.|
|MAT 23:28|So you also outwardly appear righteous to others, but within you are full of hypocrisy and lawlessness.|In this verse, Jesus continues to rebuke the hypocrisy of the Pharisees. The contrast between outward appearance and inward reality is emphasized. The term 'hypocrisy' refers to a pretense or false appearance, while 'lawlessness' indicates a lack of adherence to God's moral law. This fresh translation aims to capture the weight of the original Greek while maintaining clarity for modern readers.|
|MAT 23:29|Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you build the tombs of the prophets and decorate the monuments of the righteous.|This verse highlights the hypocrisy of the religious leaders, who honor the prophets in death while ignoring the truth they spoke during their lives. The use of 'build' and 'adorn' indicates a superficial reverence that contrasts with their actions of rejecting the prophets' messages.|
|MAT 23:30|And you say, 'If we had lived in the days of our ancestors, we would not have taken part with them in shedding the blood of the prophets.'|In this verse, Jesus is addressing the hypocrisy of the scribes and Pharisees, pointing out that they claim they would not have participated in the persecution of the prophets while, in reality, their actions contradict this assertion. The phrase 'koinoì' means to share or participate in something, while 'aima' refers to blood, symbolizing guilt and involvement in the wrongdoing against the prophets.|
|MAT 23:31|Thus, you testify against yourselves that you are the descendants of those who murdered the prophets.|In this verse, Jesus is addressing the hypocrisy of the religious leaders who claim to honor the prophets while being descendants of those who persecuted and killed them. The term 'witness' is used to indicate their own acknowledgment of their lineage, emphasizing their responsibility for their ancestors' actions.|
|MAT 23:32|And so you have filled up the measure of your forefathers.|The verse reflects the completion of a pattern of behavior passed down through generations, indicating that the audience has followed in the footsteps of their forefathers in their rejection of God's messengers.|
|MAT 23:33|Serpents, offspring of vipers! How will you escape the judgment of hell?|In this verse, the term 'vipers' is used metaphorically to describe the wickedness and deceit of the Pharisees, implying that they are poisonous and deadly in their actions and teachings. The word 'Gehenna' is a reference to the final judgment and eternal punishment, underscoring the severity of their sin and the urgency of their need for repentance.|
|MAT 23:34|Therefore, behold, I send you prophets and wise men and scribes; some of them you will kill and crucify, and some of them you will scourge in your synagogues and persecute from city to city.|This verse reflects the persistent rejection of God's messengers by the religious leaders of Israel. The term 'prophets' indicates those chosen by God to speak His truth, while 'wise men' and 'scribes' refer to learned individuals in Jewish law and wisdom. The actions described (killing, crucifying, scourging, and persecuting) highlight the severe opposition faced by these messengers. The phrase 'from city to city' underscores the widespread nature of this rejection.|
|MAT 23:35|so that upon you may come all the righteous blood shed on the earth, from the blood of righteous Abel to the blood of Zechariah son of Barachiah, whom you murdered between the sanctuary and the altar.|This verse speaks of the consequences of bloodshed, tying the righteous blood of Abel to the murder of Zechariah, indicating a continuity of violence against God's messengers throughout history. The phrase 'every righteous blood shed on the earth' suggests a divine judgment that transcends time, highlighting the severity of such acts against God's chosen.|
|MAT 23:36|Truly, I say to you, all these things will come upon this generation.|The phrase 'truly I say to you' is translated as 'Amen, I say to you', indicating the solemnity of the statement. The term 'this generation' refers to the audience present at the time of Jesus' declaration, indicating that the coming consequences will directly affect them. The word 'all' emphasizes the completeness of the judgment that is about to unfold upon that generation.|
|MAT 23:37|O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, you who kill the prophets and stone those sent to you! How often I longed to gather your children together, as a hen gathers her chicks under her wings, but you were not willing!|This verse captures Jesus' lament over Jerusalem, personifying the city as a mother hen wishing to gather her chicks. The imagery emphasizes God's desire for protection and care, while also highlighting the unwillingness of the people to accept that care. The use of 'gather' in this context signifies a deep yearning for reconciliation and safety, contrasting sharply with the violence historically meted out to prophets and messengers.|
|MAT 23:38|Behold, your house is left to you desolate.|The phrase 'your house is left to you desolate' indicates a profound abandonment and judgment from God due to unrepentant sin. The use of 'house' metaphorically represents Jerusalem and its people, while 'desolate' suggests a state of emptiness and divine judgment.|
|MAT 23:39|For I tell you, you will not see me again until you say, 'Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.'|This verse emphasizes the idea of recognizing Jesus as the Messiah who comes in the name of the Lord, echoing themes of blessing and prophecy found throughout the scriptures. The expression 'Blessed is he who comes' is a traditional welcome used in Jewish liturgy and signifies a divine approval or endorsement.|
