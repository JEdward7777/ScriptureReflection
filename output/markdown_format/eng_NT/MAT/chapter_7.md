| Reference | Verse | Translation Notes |
|:---------:|-------|-------------------|
|MAT 7:1|Do not judge others, so that you will not be judged.|In this verse, Jesus teaches the principle of refraining from judgment of others, emphasizing the reciprocal nature of judgment in human relationships. The context here is vital; this verse encourages humility and self-reflection, setting the tone for community and understanding rather than condemnation.|
|MAT 7:2|For with the measure you use, it will be measured to you; and the standard by which you judge, you will be judged.|This verse emphasizes the principle of reciprocity in judgment and measurement, warning that the standards one applies to others will be applied to oneself. The language conveys the inevitability of divine justice and the weight of personal accountability.|
|MAT 7:3|Why do you see the speck in your brother's eye, but do not notice the beam that is in your own eye?|This translation seeks to capture the essence of the original Greek while making it clear and relatable in modern English. The imagery of a small speck versus a large beam emphasizes the disparity in the faults we notice in others compared to our own.|
|MAT 7:4|Or how can you say to your brother, ‘Let me take the speck out of your eye,’ when there is a beam in your own eye?|In this translation, the focus is on the hypocrisy of pointing out a fault in others while ignoring one's own greater faults. The terms for 'brother' and 'eye' are preserved for their significant relational and metaphorical implications. The imagery of the 'speck' and 'beam' emphasizes the contrast between minor and major flaws, reinforcing the idea of self-examination before offering correction to others.|
|MAT 7:5|You hypocrite! First, take the log out of your own eye, and then you will see clearly to take the speck out of your brother's eye.|This verse highlights the importance of self-examination before attempting to correct others. The metaphor of the 'log' versus the 'speck' emphasizes the discrepancy in severity between one's own faults and those of others. The translation seeks to convey the original Greek meaning in a straightforward manner that maintains the imagery of vision and correction.|
|MAT 7:6|Do not give what is holy to dogs, nor cast your pearls before swine, lest they trample them under their feet and turn and tear you to pieces.|This verse warns against giving precious truths or wisdom to those who are unworthy or unable to appreciate them. The imagery of pearls and swine conveys the idea of discernment in sharing valuable teachings. The original Greek words indicate a strong imperative against futile endeavors that lead to harm.|
|MAT 7:7|Ask, and it will be given to you; seek, and you will find; knock, and it will be opened to you.|The translation aims to maintain the imperative tone of the original Greek, conveying a direct encouragement to engage actively in asking, seeking, and knocking. The verbs in the original text indicate a progression of action that invites deeper interaction with God. The phrasing is structured to emphasize the assurance of response from God to those who seek Him sincerely.|
|MAT 7:8|For everyone who asks receives, and he who seeks finds, and to him who knocks, it will be opened.|This verse emphasizes the assurance that everyone who asks, seeks, or knocks will receive a response. The use of the terms 'asking', 'seeking', and 'knocking' illustrates the active pursuit of divine help and provision. It reflects God's readiness to respond favorably to the earnest requests of His people, encouraging persistent faith and action.|
|MAT 7:9|Or what man among you, if his son asks for bread, will give him a stone?|This verse emphasizes the nature of fatherhood and the goodness inherent in giving. It contrasts the expectations of a loving father against the absurdity of giving something harmful when a child requests something basic and good, like bread. The imagery of bread is consistent throughout scripture as a staple of life, representing sustenance and care.|
|MAT 7:10|And if he asks for a fish, will he give him a serpent?|This verse continues the rhetorical questioning used by Jesus in this passage, emphasizing the absurdity of a father giving his child something harmful when they request something beneficial. The reference to fish and serpent mirrors the earlier bread and stone analogy, reinforcing the theme of providing good gifts instead of harmful ones.|
|MAT 7:11|If you, being evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father who is in heaven give good things to those who ask Him?|This verse emphasizes the contrast between human limitations and divine generosity. It uses the word 'evil' (πονηροὶ) to highlight our fallen nature, yet points to the goodness of God in His willingness to give good gifts to His children. The focus is on the relationship between God and believers, particularly the assurance that God knows and fulfills the needs of His people.|
|MAT 7:12|Therefore, whatever you wish that others would do to you, do also to them; for this is the essence of the Law and the Prophets.|In this verse, Jesus summarizes the essence of the law and the prophets by emphasizing the principle of reciprocity in human relationships. The phrase 'whatever you wish that others would do to you' indicates a proactive approach to kindness and respect. The use of 'for this is the law and the prophets' highlights the continuity of this teaching with the overarching message of Scripture regarding love and ethical behavior.|
|MAT 7:13|Enter through the narrow gate; for the gate is wide and the path is spacious that leads to destruction, and many are those who enter through it.|In this verse, the 'narrow gate' symbolizes the challenging path of faith and obedience to God, while the 'wide gate' represents a life led by ease and indulgence, ultimately leading to destruction. The contrast emphasizes the importance of making a deliberate choice in one's spiritual journey.|
|MAT 7:14|How narrow is the gate, and how troubled is the path that leads to life! And there are few who find it.|In this translation, the words 'narrow' and 'troubled' reflect the original Greek 'στενὴ' and 'τεθλιμμένη', conveying a sense of difficulty in the journey towards eternal life. The term 'life' used here refers specifically to eternal life, contrasting with the path that leads to destruction.|
|MAT 7:15|Beware of false prophets, who come to you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly they are ravenous wolves.|In this verse, the imagery of false prophets dressed as sheep conveys the deceptive nature of these individuals, who appear benign but are actually dangerous. The term 'wolves' denotes their predatory intent. The translation seeks to capture both the literal and metaphorical aspects of the warning Jesus gives about discernment.|
|MAT 7:16|You will know them by their fruits. Do people gather grapes from thornbushes or figs from thistles?|In this verse, the metaphor of trees and their fruits is used to convey the idea that true character and nature are revealed through actions and outcomes. The terms 'thorns' and 'thistles' represent falsehood, while 'grapes' and 'figs' symbolize the good that comes from genuine faith.|
|MAT 7:17|In the same way, every good tree produces good fruit, but a rotten tree produces bad fruit.|This verse illustrates the principle that a tree is identified by its fruit, emphasizing the contrast between good and evil. The use of the words 'good tree' and 'bad tree' signifies moral quality, while 'good fruit' and 'evil fruit' signify the results of that quality in actions or deeds.|
|MAT 7:18|A good tree cannot bear bad fruit, nor can a bad tree bear good fruit.|This verse emphasizes the principle of good and bad being inherently linked to their sources. The 'tree' metaphor illustrates the idea that the nature of a thing dictates its output, a consistent theme throughout biblical teaching on morality and behavior.|
|MAT 7:19|Every tree that does not produce good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.|This translation emphasizes the finality and seriousness of the fate of unproductive trees, capturing the metaphorical weight of judgment in the context of spiritual fruitfulness.|
|MAT 7:20|Therefore, by their fruits you will recognize them.|This verse emphasizes the principle that the quality of one's life and actions reveals one's true character. The imagery of fruit is commonly used in the Scriptures to represent the outcomes of a person's life, making it crucial to understand the relationship between one's actions and their inner state.|
|MAT 7:21|Not everyone who says to me, 'Lord, Lord,' will enter the kingdom of heaven, but only the one who does the will of my Father who is in heaven.|This verse emphasizes the distinction between mere verbal acknowledgment of Jesus as Lord and the true action of following God's will. The phrase 'Lord, Lord' indicates a deep familiarity or recognition of Jesus' authority, but the focus of this verse is on the obedience to the will of God, aligning with the broader teachings of faith and works throughout Scripture.|
|MAT 7:22|Many will say to me on that day, 'Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name, and in your name cast out demons, and in your name perform many mighty works?'|This verse addresses the theme of false claims to prophetic authority and the futility of relying solely on miraculous works or verbal declarations in the absence of genuine faith and obedience. The use of the phrase 'Lord, Lord' signifies an intimate acknowledgment of Jesus' authority, but is juxtaposed with the lack of true submission to His will.|
|MAT 7:23|And then I will declare to them, 'I never knew you; depart from me, you workers of lawlessness.'|This verse highlights the severe consequence of being rejected by Christ due to a life of sin despite outward appearances of faith. The term 'anomia' conveys a strong sense of lawlessness or iniquity, emphasizing the serious nature of the rejection.|
|MAT 7:24|Therefore, everyone who hears these words of mine and puts them into practice is like a wise man who built his house on the rock.|This verse emphasizes the importance of not only hearing the words of Jesus but also acting on them, illustrating a strong foundation through obedience to His teachings.|
|MAT 7:25|And the rain fell, and the rivers came, and the winds blew and beat against that house, yet it did not fall, for it was founded upon the rock.|This verse emphasizes the resilience of the house built on the rock amidst challenges such as rain, floods, and winds, symbolizing the trials and tribulations faced by believers. It contrasts with those whose foundations are not secure, illustrating the importance of a strong spiritual foundation in Christ.|
|MAT 7:26|And everyone who hears these words of mine and does not act on them will be like a foolish man who built his house on the sand.|The term 'foolish man' (μωρῷ) captures the essence of one who disregards wisdom and instruction. The phrase 'built his house on the sand' emphasizes the unstable foundation compared to the rock, showcasing the consequences of inaction despite hearing the teachings.|
|MAT 7:27|And the rain fell, and the rivers came, and the winds blew and struck that house; and it fell, and great was its fall.|In this verse, the imagery of storms, floods, and winds conveys the idea of trials and challenges that test the stability of one's foundation—spiritual or otherwise. The language is chosen to reflect the gravity of the consequences faced by those who do not heed wisdom, thus ensuring the gravity of the warning is captured in a fresh manner.|
|MAT 7:28|And it came to pass that when Jesus had finished these words, the crowds were amazed at his teaching.|In this translation, the term 'crowds' is retained to indicate the large number of people who were present, which conveys the impact of Jesus' teaching. The phrase 'were amazed' is used to express their reaction more vividly than simply 'were astonished.' The term 'teaching' is maintained as it directly reflects the content of Jesus’ discourse, which impressed the people. The translation is intended to emphasize the authority and impact of Jesus' words.|
|MAT 7:29|For He taught them with authority, and not as the scribes.|In this verse, the emphasis is on the authoritative manner in which Jesus taught compared to the scribes, who were known for their legalistic interpretations of the law. The Greek word 'ἐξουσίαν' (exousian) connotes not just authority, but a commanding influence and power in teaching. This fresh translation seeks to reflect that distinctiveness in Jesus’ teaching style.|
