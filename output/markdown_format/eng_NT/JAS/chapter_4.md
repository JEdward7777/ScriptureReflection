| Reference | Verse | Translation Notes |
|:---------:|-------|-------------------|
|JAS 4:1|What causes conflicts and quarrels among you? Is it not your passions that wage war within you?|This translation emphasizes the source of conflicts and desires within individuals, as well as the internal struggle stemming from sinful inclinations. The terms 'war' and 'pleasures' are crucial in highlighting the contention present in the hearts of believers.|
|JAS 4:2|You desire but do not have; you kill and covet, but you cannot obtain; you fight and quarrel. You do not have because you do not ask.|This verse reflects on the nature of desires and conflicts arising from unmet needs. The context suggests that many conflicts stem from a lack of communication with God and the act of prayer. The verbs 'ask' and 'desire' highlight the contrast between human efforts and divine provision.|
|JAS 4:3|You ask, and yet you do not receive, because you ask with wrong motives, so that you may spend it on your pleasures.|The verse emphasizes the consequences of improper motives in prayer. The original text suggests that asking without the right intention results in a lack of receiving. The word 'hedonais' indicates pleasures or sensual delights, which underscores the warning against selfish desires in one's requests to God.|
|JAS 4:4|You adulterous people! Don’t you know that friendship with the world means enmity against God? Therefore, anyone who chooses to be a friend of the world becomes an enemy of God.|In this verse, the apostle James emphasizes the conflict between worldly desires and allegiance to God. The terms 'adulterers' and 'adulteresses' metaphorically reflect the betrayal of God by aligning with the world. The text contrasts the nature of friendship with the world against enmity with God, emphasizing the seriousness of spiritual fidelity.|
|JAS 4:5|Or do you think that the Scripture says without reason, 'He yearns jealously for the spirit He has caused to dwell in us'?|The verse speaks to the profound truth that the scripture does not express its meaning in vain. The 'spirit' refers to the human spirit or soul, which is deeply affected by jealousy and desire for what is contrary to God's will. This translation captures the weight of this message without relying on existing versions.|
|JAS 4:6|But He gives a greater grace. Therefore it says, 'God opposes the proud, but gives grace to the humble.'|In this verse, the contrast between pride and humility is emphasized. The term 'grace' (χάριν) is central to understanding God's favor, which He bestows upon the humble, contrasting with His opposition to the proud. This aligns with a common biblical theme of humility being a pathway to receiving God's grace.|
|JAS 4:7|Therefore, submit yourselves to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you.|The phrase 'submit yourselves to God' indicates a voluntary yielding to God's authority, while 'resist the devil' emphasizes an active stand against evil. The structure of the command suggests both obedience to God and opposition to the enemy are essential for spiritual warfare.|
|JAS 4:8|Draw near to God, and He will draw near to you. Cleanse your hands, you sinners, and purify your hearts, you double-minded.|This translation emphasizes the urgency and relational aspect of drawing near to God, aligning with the themes of purification and sincerity in faith as expressed in the original Greek text.|
|JAS 4:9|Be afflicted, and mourn, and weep; let your laughter be turned to mourning, and your joy to heaviness.|This verse speaks to the transformation of joy into sorrow as a call to repentance. The terms used emphasize the depth of emotional response expected from believers as they confront sin and the reality of their relationship with God.|
|JAS 4:10|Humble yourselves in the presence of the Lord, and He will lift you up.|The verse emphasizes the dual concept of humility before God and the promise of exaltation. The imperative verb 'humble yourselves' indicates an active participation in lowering oneself before the Lord, which aligns with the overarching themes of repentance and dependence on God's grace found in the preceding verses. The phrase 'he will lift you up' indicates God's role in the process of exaltation, serving as both encouragement and a reminder of divine sovereignty.|
|JAS 4:11|Do not speak against one another, brothers. The one who speaks against a brother or judges his brother speaks against the law and judges the law. But if you judge the law, you are not a doer of the law but a judge.|This verse cautions against speaking ill of one another and reminds the reader of the gravity of judging others. The term ' καταλαλεῖτε ' (do not speak against) emphasizes a communal responsibility, and the call to refrain from judgment is rooted in the understanding of the law and its implications.|
|JAS 4:12|There is only one Lawgiver and Judge, the one who has the power to save and to destroy. But who are you to judge your neighbor?|This verse emphasizes the sovereignty of God as the only true lawgiver and judge. It serves as a reminder to believers of their place in relation to one another, highlighting the importance of humility and refraining from judgment. The rhetorical question posed in the latter part reinforces the idea that humans should not assume the role of God in judging others.|
|JAS 4:13|Come now, you who say, 'Today or tomorrow we will go into this city and spend a year there, and trade and make a profit.'|This verse warns against the presumption of planning the future without considering God's will. The speaker's attitude reflects a lack of humility and awareness of the uncertainty of life, which is emphasized in the verses provided that speak to the unpredictability of tomorrow and the plans we make.|
|JAS 4:14|Yet you do not know what tomorrow will bring. For what is your life? It is a mist that appears for a little while and then vanishes.|This verse reflects on the brevity of life and the uncertainty of the future. The metaphor of life being like a mist emphasizes its transient nature, prompting humility in planning and an acknowledgment of God's sovereignty.|
|JAS 4:15|Instead, you ought to say, 'If the Lord wills, we will live and do this or that.'|This verse emphasizes the importance of acknowledging God's sovereignty in our planning. The phrase 'if the Lord wills' reflects a deep understanding of our dependence on God's will for our future endeavors.|
|JAS 4:16|But now you boast in your arrogance; all such boasting is evil.|In this verse, the apostle James condemns arrogance and boasting, emphasizing the dangers of pride and self-confidence in human plans, especially when divorced from the acknowledgment of God's sovereignty. The word 'alazoneia' refers to a type of boasting that is presumptuous and deluded, indicating a false sense of security.|
|JAS 4:17|Therefore, to know the good that one ought to do and not to do it, is sin for that person.|This verse emphasizes the moral responsibility to act upon the knowledge of good, presenting a clear contrast between understanding and action. It denotes that failure to do good when one knows better constitutes sin, echoing the broader Biblical theme of accountability to God's commandments.|
