| Reference | Verse | Translation Notes |
|:---------:|-------|-------------------|
|JAS 3:1|Not many of you should become teachers, my brothers, because you know that we who teach will be judged more strictly.|This translation emphasizes the caution against seeking positions of authority without fully understanding the responsibilities and implications of teaching others. The use of 'teachers' is intentional to reflect both the role and the potential consequences of such a position, as mentioned in the Greek original.|
|JAS 3:2|For we all stumble in many ways. And if anyone does not stumble in what he says, he is a perfect man, able to control his whole body.|The Greek term 'πταίομεν' refers to stumbling or falling short, which emphasizes the fragility of human speech and its impact. The notion of 'τέλειος' denotes completeness or maturity, aligning with the idea of a person who is able to control their words and thus their actions. This verse speaks to the significance of mastering one's speech as a marker of maturity and self-control.|
|JAS 3:3|Consider the horses; we put bits in their mouths to guide them, and with them, we can steer their entire body.|This verse illustrates the concept of control over one’s body through the metaphor of a horse's bit, emphasizing the significant influence of our words and thoughts. It encourages self-discipline and awareness of how we direct our actions and behaviors.|
|JAS 3:4|Look at the ships; though they are so large and driven by fierce winds, they are turned about by a very small rudder wherever the helmsman desires.|In this verse, the imagery of a ship being steered by a small rudder amidst powerful winds illustrates the concept of guidance and control. It highlights the importance of a small but powerful influence over something much larger. The choice of the word 'urged' reflects both the force of the wind and the determined action of the helmsman.|
|JAS 3:5|So also the tongue is a small member, yet it boasts of great things. Behold, how great a forest is set ablaze by such a small fire!|In this verse, James uses the metaphor of the tongue to emphasize the power of speech. The imagery of fire and forest highlights the destructive potential of careless words. The word 'boast' in the translation reflects the original term that conveys arrogance and pride associated with the tongue's utterances.|
|JAS 3:6|And the tongue is a fire, the world of iniquity. Thus, the tongue can defile the whole body and set ablaze the course of our lives, being ignited by hell.|The Greek word 'γλῶσσα' refers to the tongue or speech, signifying its capability to create significant impact. 'πῦρ' denotes fire, used metaphorically to indicate destruction or the intense influence of the tongue. The phrase 'κόσμος τῆς ἀδικίας' is interpreted as the 'world of injustice,' implying the pervasive impact of malicious speech. 'σπιλοῦσα' indicates a staining or defiling effect. The imagery of 'φλογίζουσα' speaks to the destructive potential of the tongue, akin to a flame that consumes everything in its path. 'γεέννης' refers to a place of punishment, underscoring the serious consequences of unrestrained speech.|
|JAS 3:7|For every kind of beast and bird, reptile and sea creature, can be tamed and has been tamed by mankind's nature.|In this verse, the term 'nature' refers to the innate qualities and behaviors that characterize different species of animals and birds. The phrase 'wild beasts and birds' aligns with common biblical imagery of creation and dominion. The contrast to 'human nature' highlights the unique authority humans possess in relation to creation.|
|JAS 3:8|But no human being can tame the tongue; it is a restless evil, full of deadly poison.|The verse emphasizes the uncontrollable nature of the tongue, which can bring about great harm. The Greek words ‘δαμάσαι’ (to tame) and ‘ἀκατάσχετον’ (uncontrollable) illustrate the challenges in mastering the tongue. The phrase ‘μεστὴ ἰοῦ θανατηφόρου’ suggests that the tongue is full of deadly poison, highlighting its potential for destruction. This translation aims to capture both the literal and the metaphorical weight of the original text.|
|JAS 3:9|With it we bless our Lord and Father, and with it we curse people made in the likeness of God.|This verse highlights the contradictory nature of human speech, particularly how we can both praise God and curse those created in His image. The terms 'bless' and 'curse' indicate a deep moral conflict, as both actions should be incompatible yet are expressed through the same organ—the tongue.|
|JAS 3:10|From the same mouth come both blessing and cursing. My brothers, this should not be so.|This verse highlights the inconsistency of using one's speech for both blessing and cursing, which should not be the case for believers. The translation aims to capture the directness of James' admonition to the community of faith.|
|JAS 3:11|Does a spring pour forth from the same opening both fresh and bitter water?|In this verse, James uses the metaphor of a spring to illustrate the inconsistency of the human tongue. The imagery of a source that brings forth both sweet and bitter waters emphasizes the need for purity and integrity in our speech, which should align with the righteousness expected of believers.|
|JAS 3:12|My brothers, can a fig tree bear olives, or a grapevine produce figs? Neither can a salt spring yield fresh water.|This verse emphasizes the principle of consistency in the type of fruit produced, symbolically referring to the actions and words of individuals. The metaphor of trees and springs highlights the idea that one's inner character determines their external expressions.|
|JAS 3:13|Who among you is wise and understanding? Let them show it by their good life, by deeds done in the humility that comes from wisdom.|In this verse, the terms 'wise' and 'understanding' are central, indicating a call for those who claim wisdom to demonstrate it through their actions, particularly in gentleness. The Greek word for 'gentleness' (πραΰτητι) suggests humility and consideration, which are key qualities of true wisdom. This verse connects closely to the themes of humility and behavior seen in Proverbs and other scriptural texts.|
|JAS 3:14|But if you harbor bitter envy and selfish ambition in your hearts, do not boast about it or deny the truth.|The verse emphasizes the destructive nature of bitter jealousy and selfish ambition within the heart, cautioning against boasting and deception that goes against the truth. It highlights the contrast between true wisdom and the false wisdom stemming from self-centered motives.|
|JAS 3:15|This wisdom is not that which comes down from above, but is earthly, unspiritual, and demonic.|The verse emphasizes that the type of wisdom being described is not divine but rather is rooted in earthly, unspiritual, and demonic sources. This contrasts with the wisdom from above which is pure, peaceable, gentle, open to reason, full of mercy, and good fruits, as noted in the preceding context.|
|JAS 3:16|For where jealousy and selfish ambition exist, there is disorder and every vile practice.|The original Greek highlights the relationship between jealousy (ζῆλος) and disorder (ἀκαταστασία). This translation emphasizes the moral implications of these qualities and their effects on community life, resonating with the surrounding context that contrasts divine wisdom with earthly wisdom.|
|JAS 3:17|But the wisdom that comes from above is first pure, then peace-loving, considerate, submissive, full of mercy and good fruit, impartial and sincere.|This verse describes the qualities of wisdom that comes from above, contrasting it with worldly wisdom. Each characteristic highlighted (pure, peaceable, gentle, open to reason, full of mercy, and good fruits) contributes to the overall understanding of divine wisdom that is not only wise but also acts in a way that promotes peace and goodness.|
|JAS 3:18|And the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace by those who make peace.|This verse highlights the outcome of righteousness, specifically linking it to peace and the actions of those who strive to promote peace. The choice of 'sown' instead of 'produced' emphasizes the proactive nature of those who pursue peace in their lives.|
