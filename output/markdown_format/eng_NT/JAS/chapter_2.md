| Reference | Verse | Translation Notes |
|:---------:|-------|-------------------|
|JAS 2:1|My brothers and sisters, do not hold your faith in our glorious Lord Jesus Christ with partiality.|In this verse, James emphasizes the importance of not showing favoritism or partiality, especially concerning faith in Jesus Christ. The Greek term for 'favoritism' (προσωποληψίαις) suggests an outward appearance or superficial judgment based on social status, which contrasts with the values of the kingdom of God where all are equal. This sets a foundation for understanding how believers should relate to one another, reflecting God's impartial love.|
|JAS 2:2|For if there should come into your assembly a man with a gold ring, dressed in splendid clothes, and also there comes in a poor man in filthy garments,|This verse illustrates the contrast between social status and God's view of humanity. The use of 'gold rings' and 'fine clothing' contrasts with 'poor' and 'soiled clothing' to demonstrate the issue of favoritism based on outward appearances. In a church context, this verse serves as a warning against valuing people by their wealth or status instead of their faith and character.|
|JAS 2:3|And if you pay attention to the one wearing the fine clothing and say, 'You sit here in a good place,' but to the poor man you say, 'You stand there' or 'Sit here at my feet,'|This verse emphasizes the error of favoritism based on outward appearances. The Greek word for 'look upon' (ἐπιβλέψητε) suggests a careful consideration or evaluation of someone, which is contrasted with the Christian principle of seeing beyond external factors.|
|JAS 2:4|Have you not then made distinctions among yourselves and become judges with evil thoughts?|In this verse, James highlights the danger of making judgments based on external appearances, calling attention to the hypocrisy of treating individuals differently based on their socio-economic status. The term 'wicked thoughts' suggests not only unjust reasoning but also an underlying moral corruption in such attitudes.|
|JAS 2:5|Listen, my beloved brothers. Has not God chosen the poor of this world to be rich in faith and heirs of the kingdom which He promised to those who love Him?|This verse emphasizes God's choice of the poor in faith over the rich, underscoring the theme of God's grace towards the humble and the rich man's fleeting status.|
|JAS 2:6|But you have dishonored the poor man. Do not the rich oppress you and drag you into courts?|This verse addresses the issue of how the poor are treated in society, particularly in the context of their oppression by the wealthy. It emphasizes the contrast between the rich and the poor, highlighting a social injustice that the early Christian community was encouraged to recognize and resist.|
|JAS 2:7|Are they not the ones who blaspheme the honorable name by which you are called?|This verse addresses the act of blasphemy directed at God's name due to the actions of others, particularly focusing on how those in power can misuse their influence against the faithful. It serves as a reminder of the reverence due to God's name and the negative implications when it is tarnished by the behaviors of those who are supposed to uphold it.|
|JAS 2:8|If you truly fulfill the royal law according to the Scripture, ‘You shall love your neighbor as yourself,’ you are doing well.|The verse emphasizes the royal law of love, highlighting its significance in the Christian faith. The term 'royal law' indicates that loving one's neighbor is not merely a suggestion but a fundamental principle in God's law. This reflects the teachings of the Old Testament and the continuity in the New Testament, where love is central to the believer's conduct.|
|JAS 2:9|But if you show favoritism, you commit sin and are convicted by the law as transgressors.|The term 'prosopoleptēs' translates to 'showing partiality,' indicating favoritism or discrimination. The phrase 'working sin' refers to committing sin through such actions. This translation captures the essence of the verse by emphasizing the moral failure of showing favoritism, aligning with the broader biblical theme of equality and justice among believers.|
|JAS 2:10|For whoever keeps the whole law but stumbles at just one point is guilty of breaking all of it.|This verse highlights the seriousness of breaking even one commandment of the law, establishing the principle that failure in one aspect renders one guilty of all. This reflects the high standard of the moral law and the interconnectedness of its commandments.|
|JAS 2:11|For He who said, 'You shall not commit adultery,' also said, 'You shall not murder.' If you do not commit adultery but you murder, you have become a lawbreaker.|This verse emphasizes the unity of the law and how violating any part equates to breaking the whole. It references the moral weight of both adultery and murder as significant transgressions within the framework of the law.|
|JAS 2:12|So speak and act as those who are to be judged under the law of liberty.|This verse emphasizes the importance of both speech and action in relation to the law of liberty, indicating that believers are accountable for their conduct according to this law. The phrase 'law of liberty' connects to the broader theme of freedom found in Christ, as expressed in previous verses.|
|JAS 2:13|For judgment is without mercy to the one who has shown no mercy. Mercy triumphs over judgment.|This verse emphasizes the principle that mercy triumphs over judgment, suggesting that those who fail to show mercy will not receive mercy themselves. The structure of the original Greek is maintained in this translation to convey the original intent more faithfully.|
|JAS 2:14|What good is it, my brothers, if someone claims to have faith but does not have works? Can that faith save him?|This translation emphasizes the relationship between faith and works, highlighting that a claim to have faith must be accompanied by actions that demonstrate that faith. The rhetorical question underscores the futility of claiming to have faith while lacking the corresponding deeds.|
|JAS 2:15|If a brother or sister is without clothing and lacks daily food,|In this translation, the emphasis is placed on the physical needs of the brother or sister who is destitute. The word 'naked' refers to being without adequate clothing, and 'lacking' conveys the absence of daily provisions, thus underscoring the seriousness of their plight.|
|JAS 2:16|And if someone says to them, 'Go in peace, be warm and filled,' yet does not provide for their physical needs, what good is that?|This verse highlights the futility of merely wishing someone well without taking tangible action to meet their needs. The emphasis is on practical assistance, aligning with the overarching message of faith being active through love and service.|
|JAS 2:17|So also faith, if it does not have works, is dead by itself.|The Greek phrase 'ἡ πίστις' (the faith) emphasizes a belief that is not merely theoretical but must be active. The concept of faith being 'dead' without works highlights the importance of actions that reflect one’s beliefs. This translation seeks to convey the direct correlation between faith and works as essential elements of the Christian life.|
|JAS 2:18|But someone will say, 'You have faith, and I have works.' Show me your faith apart from your works, and I will show you my faith by my works.|This verse emphasizes the interplay between faith and works, suggesting that true faith is evidenced by action. The challenge presented is to demonstrate one's faith through tangible deeds, highlighting the practical nature of belief.|
|JAS 2:19|You believe that God is one; you do well. Even the demons believe—and shudder.|This verse emphasizes the difference between mere belief and true faith that produces action. While even demons believe in God's oneness, it is the response to that belief that separates true faith from a passive acknowledgment.|
|JAS 2:20|But do you want to know, O foolish man, that faith without works is dead?|This verse emphasizes the necessity of works in conjunction with faith, addressing the empty nature of faith that does not manifest in action. The Greek term 'κενέ' implies a hollowness or emptiness, suggesting that faith devoid of deeds is lifeless.|
|JAS 2:21|Was not our father Abraham justified by works when he offered Isaac his son on the altar?|This verse illustrates the relationship between faith and actions, emphasizing that true faith is demonstrated through works. The reference to Abraham and Isaac showcases a pivotal moment in Abraham's life where his faith was acted upon through obedience.|
|JAS 2:22|You see that faith was active together with his works, and by works, faith was brought to completion.|In this verse, the emphasis is on the collaboration between faith and works, illustrating how true faith is demonstrated through actions. The phrase 'faith was completed by his works' signifies that genuine faith is not just intellectual assent but is manifested through obedience and action, particularly in the context of Abraham's obedience in offering Isaac.|
|JAS 2:23|And the Scripture was fulfilled that says, 'Abraham believed God, and it was credited to him as righteousness,' and he was called a friend of God.|This verse highlights the relationship between faith and righteousness, referencing Abraham's trust in God. It emphasizes that faith, accompanied by works, is essential for righteousness. The term 'friend of God' is a significant honor indicating a deep relationship with the divine.|
|JAS 2:24|You see that a person is justified by works and not by faith alone.|In this verse, the emphasis is on the necessity of works alongside faith in demonstrating one's righteousness before God. The word 'δικαιοῦται' is understood as being justified or deemed righteous, which indicates a legal standing before God. The phrase 'οὐκ ἐκ πίστεως μόνον' emphasizes that faith alone is insufficient for justification, highlighting the essential role of deeds in the life of a believer.|
|JAS 2:25|In the same way, was not Rahab the harlot also justified by her actions when she welcomed the spies and sent them out by another way?|In this verse, Rahab is presented as an example of faith expressed through action. The term 'justified' here refers to being deemed righteous before God, which is achieved through her actions of receiving the spies. The phrase 'by works' indicates the necessity of demonstrating faith through tangible deeds, aligning with the central theme of the chapter that faith is evidenced by works.|
|JAS 2:26|For just as the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without deeds is also dead.|This translation emphasizes the intrinsic relationship between faith and works, echoing the original Greek text while ensuring clarity for modern readers.|
