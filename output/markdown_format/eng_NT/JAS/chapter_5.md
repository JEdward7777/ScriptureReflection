| Reference | Verse | Translation Notes |
|:---------:|-------|-------------------|
|JAS 5:1|Come now, you rich, weep and wail for the miseries that are coming upon you!|This verse uses strong language to evoke the sorrow and despair of the wealthy in light of impending judgment. The words 'cry' and 'howl' express a deep sense of regret for the suffering that results from their reliance on wealth. The phrase 'coming miseries' signifies an unavoidable reckoning that awaits those who exploit their riches without concern for others.|
|JAS 5:2|Your wealth has rotted, and your garments are moth-eaten.|In this verse, James uses vivid imagery to describe the decay of material wealth and garments, highlighting the transitory nature of earthly riches. The Greek term for 'rust' is suggestive of a deeper spiritual decay, emphasizing that reliance on material wealth leads to inevitable corruption and ruin.|
|JAS 5:3|Your gold and silver are corroded, and their corrosion will be a testimony against you and will eat your flesh like fire. You have laid up treasure in the last days.|The verse emphasizes the temporal nature of material wealth and the ultimate consequences of hoarding riches at the expense of righteousness. The imagery of corrosion and fire is used to illustrate judgment and decay, stressing the futility of earthly treasures.|
|JAS 5:4|Behold, the wages of the laborers who harvested your fields, which you kept back by fraud, cry out; and the cries of the reapers have reached the ears of the Lord of hosts.|This translation emphasizes the plight of the laborers and the seriousness of their cries to God, aligning with the social justice themes prevalent in the Bible. The term 'wages' and the idea of 'crying out' reflect both the tangible injustice of unpaid labor and the spiritual response that God has towards such injustices.|
|JAS 5:5|You have lived luxuriously on the earth and indulged yourselves; you have fattened your hearts in a day of slaughter.|This verse emphasizes the indulgence and extravagance of those who prioritize earthly pleasures over spiritual integrity. The terms used reflect a lifestyle of opulence and a neglect for the consequences of their actions, especially in relation to others.|
|JAS 5:6|You have condemned and murdered the righteous one; he does not resist you.|This verse serves as a grave warning about the consequences of injustice and the persecution of the righteous. The verbs used in the original Greek express a strong condemnation of the actions taken against the just, emphasizing the moral gravity of such behavior. The phrase 'you have condemned' suggests a decisive action against someone without just cause, and 'you have murdered' underlines the severity of the sin, implicating the accuser in deep wrongdoing. The final phrase reinforces the idea of impunity, indicating that the just do not resist evil with retaliation, which aligns with Christian teachings about grace and mercy.|
|JAS 5:7|Therefore, brothers, be patient until the coming of the Lord. See how the farmer waits for the precious fruit of the earth, being patient for it until he receives the early and late rains.|This verse encourages believers to remain patient and steadfast, likening their endurance to that of a farmer waiting for the crops. The imagery of waiting for both early and late rains symbolizes the hope and assurance in God's timing for the fulfillment of His promises.|
|JAS 5:8|You also, be patient; strengthen your hearts, for the coming of the Lord is near.|The original Greek emphasizes the importance of patience and heart-strengthening in light of the Lord's imminent return. This translation seeks to capture both the urgency of preparation and the call for steadfastness.|
|JAS 5:9|Do not grumble against one another, brothers, lest you be judged; behold, the Judge is standing at the door.|In this verse, James warns against grumbling and complaining about one another, reminding believers that judgment awaits. The phrase 'the judge is standing at the door' signifies the imminent return of Christ and serves as a call to maintain unity and love among brethren.|
|JAS 5:10|As examples of suffering and patience, brothers, take the prophets who spoke in the name of the Lord.|This translation emphasizes the examples of patience and suffering from the prophets, who serve as models for the believers. The term 'long-suffering' aligns with the original Greek term used, which indicates a patience that withstands hardships.|
|JAS 5:11|Indeed, we consider those blessed who have persevered. You have heard of the endurance of Job, and you have seen the outcome that the Lord brought aboutâ€”how the Lord is full of compassion and mercy.|In this verse, the focus is on the blessedness of those who endure suffering, with Job as an example of patience amidst trials. The attributes of God, being compassionate and merciful, are highlighted, showing His response to human suffering.|
|JAS 5:12|Above all, my brothers, do not swear, either by heaven or by earth or by any other oath; but let your yes be yes, and your no be no, so that you may not fall under judgment.|This verse emphasizes the importance of integrity and straightforwardness in speech. Swearing oaths was a common practice in biblical times, often to reinforce the truthfulness of one's words. Here, James encourages believers to be simple and honest in their affirmations, without the need for oaths, thereby avoiding hypocrisy.|
|JAS 5:13|Is anyone among you suffering? Let him pray. Is anyone cheerful? Let him sing praise.|This translation aims to reflect the call to both prayer in times of trouble and joyful expression in times of happiness, emphasizing community and the importance of faith in daily life.|
|JAS 5:14|Is anyone among you sick? Let him call for the elders of the church, and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord.|This verse emphasizes the community aspect of faith and healing, highlighting the roles of church elders and the practice of anointing with oil as acts of faith and obedience to God.|
|JAS 5:15|And the prayer offered in faith will heal the sick, and the Lord will raise him up; and if he has committed sins, they will be forgiven him.|This translation emphasizes the power of prayer and faith, suggesting that healing is closely tied to one's belief. The phrase 'the prayer of faith' captures the essence of reliance on God, while 'the one who is suffering' directly reflects the text's intent to provide comfort and assurance of healing through faith.|
|JAS 5:16|Therefore, confess your sins to one another and pray for each other, so that you may be healed. The prayer of a righteous person is powerful and effective.|This verse emphasizes the communal aspect of confession and prayer among believers. The original Greek terms imply a mutual support system where sins are acknowledged and intercessory prayers are offered, leading to healing and restoration.|
|JAS 5:17|Elijah was a man with a nature like ours, and he fervently prayed that it would not rain; and it did not rain on the earth for three years and six months.|This translation emphasizes the humanity of Elijah and the power of prayer in effecting change in the natural order. The phrase 'human like us' highlights Elijah's shared experience with believers, and the connection to prayer reinforces the message of the previous verse regarding the power of a righteous person's prayer.|
|JAS 5:18|And again he prayed, and the heavens gave rain, and the earth yielded its fruit.|This verse demonstrates the power of prayer, reflecting on the example of Elijah, who, through prayer, influenced the weather and the productivity of the land. The original Greek highlights the sequence of prayer and divine response, emphasizing God's ability to grant the requests of those who fervently pray.|
|JAS 5:19|Brothers, if anyone among you wanders from the truth and someone brings him back,|The term 'stray' is a metaphor for falling away from faith or the truth, paralleling the concept of 'returning' or 'turning back' which is often used in the context of repentance. The encouragement to restore those who have gone astray underscores the communal responsibility within the church.|
|JAS 5:20|Let him know that whoever turns a sinner back from the error of his way will save a soul from death and will cover a multitude of sins.|This verse emphasizes the importance of restoring those who have strayed from the faith. The terminology used reflects both the act of returning a sinner to the right path and the profound impact such an action has on their soul, suggesting a redemptive quality that covers numerous transgressions. The themes of sin, restoration, and the life-saving nature of spiritual intervention are critical to understanding this passage.|
