|:---------:|-------|-------------------|
|REV 10:1|And I saw another strong angel descending from heaven, wrapped in a cloud, and a rainbow was upon his head; his face shone like the sun, and his feet were like pillars of fire.|This verse describes a powerful angel descending from heaven, enveloped in a cloud and radiating glory, characterized by a rainbow on his head and a face that shines like the sun. The choice of words aims to reflect both the majesty and the divine nature of the being, staying true to the imagery present in the original Greek text.|
|REV 10:2|And he had in his hand an open scroll. He set his right foot upon the sea, and his left foot upon the land.|In this verse, the imagery of the open book symbolizes divine revelation and the angel's authority. The act of placing one foot on the sea and the other on the land signifies a declaration of dominion over both realms, emphasizing the scope of his mission and authority as an envoy from God.|
|REV 10:3|And he cried out with a loud voice, like a lion roaring. And when he cried out, the seven thunders uttered their voices.|The phrase 'cried out with a loud voice' in this context indicates a proclamation of significant importance. The imagery of a lion emphasizes authority and power. The mention of the 'seven thunders' suggests divine judgment and the incomprehensible mystery of God's purposes.|
|REV 10:4|And when the seven thunders had spoken, I was about to write; but I heard a voice from heaven saying, 'Seal up what the seven thunders have said, and do not write it down.'|In this verse, the command to seal the words of the seven thunders indicates that their message is not to be revealed. This can be contrasted with the revelation of other aspects of God's plan that are meant to be shared. The use of the term 'thunders' carries the connotation of divine authority and power, similar to the portrayal in the Psalms and Job.|
|REV 10:5|And the angel whom I saw standing on the sea and on the land raised his right hand to heaven.|The imagery of the angel lifting his right hand toward heaven signifies a solemn oath or declaration, drawing parallels with biblical themes of authority and divine witness. The reference to the right hand reflects both strength and the common posture of making promises or invoking God's presence.|
|REV 10:6|And he swore by the One who lives forever and ever, who created the heavens and all that is in them, and the earth and all that is upon it, and the sea and all that is in it, saying, "There will be no more delay."|This verse emphasizes the eternal nature of God and His authority over creation. The phrase 'time shall be no more' indicates a significant shift in God's plan, where the previous order of time is coming to an end. The creation references serve to reinforce God's sovereignty over all that exists, providing a powerful context for the finality expressed in this verse.|
|REV 10:7|But in the days of the voice of the seventh angel, when he is about to sound his trumpet, the mystery of God will be fulfilled, just as He declared to His servants the prophets.|In this verse, the phrase 'the days of the voice of the seventh angel' signifies a specific time when God's plan, referred to as 'the mystery of God,' reaches its culmination. The use of the term 'mystery' throughout the New Testament often implies a truth that was previously hidden but is now revealed through divine revelation. This connects with the prophetic nature of God's message to His servants, the prophets.|
|REV 10:8|And the voice that I heard from heaven spoke again with me, saying, ‘Go, take the little scroll that is open in the hand of the angel standing on the sea and on the land.’|In this verse, the imagery of receiving a scroll from an angel signifies the transmission of divine revelation and knowledge. The term 'little scroll' is specifically used to convey the essence of the message contained within. The action of taking the scroll emphasizes the believer's active engagement with God's Word.|
|REV 10:9|So I went to the angel and said to him, ‘Give me the little scroll.’ And he said to me, ‘Take it and eat it; it will make your stomach bitter, but in your mouth it will be as sweet as honey.'|The imagery of eating a scroll symbolizes receiving and internalizing the divine message. The contrasting flavors represent the experience of prophetic revelation: sweet in anticipation but bitter in the reality it brings.|
|REV 10:10|And I took the scroll from the angel's hand and ate it; it was as sweet as honey in my mouth, but when I had eaten it, my stomach became bitter.|The imagery of consuming a scroll symbolizes internalizing God's message, where the sweetness represents the initial joy and allure of the word, while the bitterness indicates the difficult truths it may bring. The use of 'sweet as honey' aligns with biblical metaphors of delight and wisdom found in scripture.|
|REV 10:11|And they said to me, 'You must prophesy again concerning many peoples and nations and languages and kings.'|This verse emphasizes the necessity for John to prophesy again, highlighting the universal reach of his message to various peoples and nations. The terms 'nations' and 'languages' reflect the diverse audiences for the prophetic messages.|
