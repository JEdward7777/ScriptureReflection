|REV 6:1|And I watched as the Lamb opened one of the seven seals; and I heard one of the four living creatures saying, with a voice like thunder, 'Come!'|This verse captures the moment of the opening of the first seal, a critical event in the Book of Revelation. The use of the term 'Lamb' refers to Christ, emphasizing His sacrificial role. The phrase 'as the voice of thunder' denotes the authority and power of the call.

The imagery of the white horse is often associated with righteousness and purity, while the crown signifies authority and victory. The verb ‘to conquer’ is repeated to emphasize the ongoing nature of the mission of the rider on the horse, indicative of a relentless pursuit of triumph.|
|REV 6:3|And when He opened the second seal, I heard the second living creature say, 'Come forth!'|The second seal is opened, leading to the call from the second living creature.

This translation aims to maintain the vividness of the original Greek while ensuring clarity in English.|
|REV 6:6|And I heard a voice in the midst of the four living creatures saying, 'A measure of wheat for a denarius, and three measures of barley for a denarius; but do not harm the oil and the wine.'|In this translation, I have maintained the agricultural and economic context present in the original text, emphasizing the scarcity of essential goods.

The repeated mention of blood in both this verse and the related verses underlines the theme of divine retribution for martyrdom.|
|REV 6:11|And a white robe was given to each of them, and they were told to rest a little longer, until the full number of their fellow servants and brothers should be completed, who were to be killed as they themselves had been.|In this verse, the imagery of white robes symbolizes purity and righteousness, which is consistent with the promise of rest for those who have suffered for their faith. The call for patience reflects the theme of enduring faithfulness until God's appointed time for justice. The phrase 'for a little while' emphasizes the temporary nature of their wait in light of eternal glory.|

The terminology emphasizes both social status and a collective human reaction to divine wrath, illustrating the futility of attempting to hide from God’s judgment.|
|REV 6:16|And they cried out to the mountains and the rocks, 'Fall upon us and hide us from the face of Him who is seated on the throne and from the wrath of the Lamb.'|In this verse, the imagery of hiding among the mountains and rocks reflects both fear and desperation in response to divine judgment.
