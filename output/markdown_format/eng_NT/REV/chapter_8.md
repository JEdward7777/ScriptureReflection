| Reference | Verse | Translation Notes |
|:---------:|-------|-------------------|
|REV 8:1|And when He opened the seventh seal, there was silence in heaven for about half an hour.|The phrase 'σιγὴ ἐν τῷ οὐρανῷ' captures a profound moment of silence, indicative of reverence and awe before the divine. The metaphor of 'half an hour' indicates a specific but uncertain period of anticipation, suggesting a significant pause before the forthcoming events. The structure reflects the dramatic build-up typical in apocalyptic literature, emphasizing both the tension and the gravity of what is about to unfold.|
|REV 8:2|And I saw the seven angels who stood before God, and to them were given seven trumpets.|In this verse, the imagery of angels before God is significant as it emphasizes their role as ministers and heralds of God's will. The number seven is often associated with divine completeness in Scripture, highlighting the importance of these angels in the unfolding events of Revelation.|
|REV 8:3|And another angel came and stood at the altar, holding a golden censer; and he was given much incense to offer, with the prayers of all the saints, upon the golden altar before the throne.|In this verse, the emphasis is on the role of the angel as a mediator who presents the prayers of the saints before God. The use of 'golden incense' suggests the purity and value of the prayers being offered. The connection to the altar and the throne highlights the sacredness of the act. 'Many incense' indicates the multitude of prayers collected, reflecting the collective supplication of all the saints.|
|REV 8:4|And the smoke of the incense, along with the prayers of the saints, ascended from the angel's hand before God.|The imagery of incense rising signifies the prayers of the saints being accepted by God. The connection to earlier scriptures emphasizes the theme of prayer and divine acceptance.|
|REV 8:5|And the angel took the censer, filled it with fire from the altar, and hurled it to the earth. And there were voices, thunderings, lightnings, and an earthquake.|In this verse, the action of the angel taking the incense and filling it with fire from the altar symbolizes the intercession of prayers and divine judgment. The use of fire reflects purification and the power of God's presence. The ensuing thunder, voices, lightnings, and earthquake are typical manifestations of God's might and are meant to convey a sense of awe and reverence in the presence of the divine.|
|REV 8:6|And the seven angels who held the seven trumpets prepared themselves to sound.|The verse describes the preparation of seven angels who hold trumpets, signifying the impending proclamation of God's judgment and purposes. The term 'sounded' (σάλπιγγας) connects this action to a divine announcement, akin to the trumpet calls found throughout scripture. The word 'prepared' (ἡτοίμασαν) emphasizes their readiness to execute God's commands, resonating with the concept of angels being messengers in both the Old and New Testaments.|
|REV 8:7|And the first angel sounded his trumpet, and there came hail and fire mixed with blood, and it was hurled down upon the earth; and a third of the earth was burned up, and a third of the trees were burned up, and all the green grass was burned up.|The imagery in this verse reflects God's judgment and the cataclysmic events that are associated with the sounding of the first trumpet. The combination of hail and fire mingled with blood conveys a sense of chaos and divine intervention, indicative of apocalyptic themes throughout the Book of Revelation. The translation attempts to maintain the original intensity and vividness of the text.|
|REV 8:8|And the second angel sounded his trumpet, and something like a great mountain burning with fire was thrown into the sea; and a third of the sea became blood.|The imagery of a burning mountain and the transformation of a third of the sea into blood draws parallels with divine judgment and calamity seen in previous scriptures. The text emphasizes the catastrophic nature of the events during the trumpet judgments in Revelation, connecting them with God's sovereignty over creation.|
|REV 8:9|And a third of the living creatures in the sea died, and a third of the ships were destroyed.|This translation reflects the severe consequences of divine judgment, emphasizing the loss of life among creatures in the sea, and the destruction of ships. The use of 'third' indicates a significant yet not total devastation, resonating with other biblical judgments.|
|REV 8:10|And the third angel sounded his trumpet, and a great star fell from heaven, burning like a lamp, and it fell upon a third of the rivers and upon the springs of water.|This verse describes the dramatic fall of a celestial body, symbolizing divine judgment and affecting natural resources, similar to the themes of destruction and the impact on creation found in the previous verses. The imagery of a burning star and its consequences links to the broader apocalyptic narrative in Revelation.|
|REV 8:11|And the name of the star is called Wormwood. And a third of the waters became bitter, and many people died from the waters because they were made bitter.|The term 'Wormwood' in this passage symbolizes bitterness and calamity, drawing on imagery found in the Old Testament. The phrase 'a third of the waters' emphasizes the widespread impact of the star's fall, leading to death among humanity due to the bitterness introduced into the water supply.|
|REV 8:12|And the fourth angel sounded his trumpet, and a third of the sun was struck, and a third of the moon, and a third of the stars, so that a third of them was darkened, and the day did not shine for a third of it, and likewise the night.|This verse conveys a sense of cosmic disturbance and judgment. The use of 'a third' emphasizes the significant yet partial nature of the events described, suggesting that these events serve as warnings rather than complete destruction. The words 'darkened' and 'shine' are crucial to understanding the imagery of loss and foreboding within the context of divine judgment.|
|REV 8:13|And I looked, and I heard one eagle flying in midheaven, saying with a loud voice, "Woe, woe, woe to those who dwell on the earth, because of the remaining blasts of the trumpets of the three angels who are about to sound!"|This verse serves as a significant turning point in Revelation, highlighting the severity of the impending judgments. The use of the term 'woe' emphasizes the grave circumstances faced by the inhabitants of the earth as the plagues of the trumpets unfold. The imagery of an eagle is particularly evocative, symbolizing swiftness and the proclamation of distress from the heavens.|
