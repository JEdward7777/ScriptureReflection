| Reference | Verse | Translation Notes |
|:---------:|-------|-------------------|
|REV 9:1|And the fifth angel sounded his trumpet; and I saw a star that had fallen from heaven to the earth, and to him was given the key to the abyss.|In this verse, the imagery of a star falling from heaven symbolizes a significant celestial event and the authority granted to the angel to access the abyss. The word 'key' represents power and control over the abyss, a common motif in scripture that denotes dominion over spiritual realms.|
|REV 9:2|And he opened the pit of the abyss, and smoke arose from the pit like the smoke of a burning furnace; and the sun and the air were darkened because of the smoke from the pit.|This verse vividly illustrates the opening of the abyss and the resultant smoke that darkens the sun and air, symbolizing spiritual darkness and judgment. The imagery of smoke from a furnace resonates with biblical themes of divine wrath and destruction, emphasizing the serious nature of the events unfolding in the apocalypse.|
|REV 9:3|And from the smoke came forth locusts upon the earth, and they were given authority like the authority that scorpions have on the earth.|The term 'locusts' symbolizes both destruction and divine judgment, paralleling the authority given to them similar to that of scorpions, which are also seen as symbols of pain and judgment in biblical contexts.|
|REV 9:4|And they were told not to harm the grass of the earth, nor any green thing, nor any tree, but only those people who do not have the seal of God on their foreheads.|In this verse, the locusts are commanded not to harm the vegetation of the earth, signifying the divine protection of God's creation. The phrase 'those who do not have the seal of God on their foreheads' emphasizes the distinction between those who belong to God and those who do not, suggesting divine judgment upon the latter.|
|REV 9:5|And they were given authority not to kill them, but to torment them for five months; and their torment was like the torment of a scorpion when it strikes a man.|This verse highlights the nature of torment that these creatures will inflict, which is likened to the sting of a scorpion. The duration specified as five months suggests a limited, yet intense, period of suffering. It also reflects on divine permission for a specific purpose, contrasting with the absolute destruction often attributed to evil forces.|
|REV 9:6|In those days, people will seek death and will not find it; they will long to die, but death will flee from them.|This verse expresses the deep despair and hopelessness experienced by humanity during the torment. The language emphasizes the futile search for death amidst suffering, highlighting the extent of their anguish.|
|REV 9:7|And the shapes of the locusts were like horses prepared for battle, and on their heads were crowns resembling gold, and their faces were like the faces of men.|In this translation, I have captured the vivid imagery and symbolism inherent in the original Greek text. The terms describing the locusts (or beings) emphasize their appearance, likening them to horses prepared for battle, and the crowns resembling gold further enhances their ominous beauty.|
|REV 9:8|They had hair like the hair of women, and their teeth were like those of lions.|In this verse, the imagery draws from the qualities associated with womenâ€™s hair and the ferocity associated with lions. This creates a juxtaposition between beauty and danger, underscoring the fearsome aspect of these creatures.|
|REV 9:9|They had breastplates that looked like iron, and the sound of their wings was like the noise of many chariots with horses rushing into battle.|This verse employs vivid imagery to convey the formidable appearance and the noise of the locusts, emphasizing both their armor-like appearance and the sound of their wings likened to war chariots, reflecting themes of judgment and conflict found throughout apocalyptic literature.|
|REV 9:10|And they had tails like scorpions, with stingers, and in their tails they had the power to harm men for five months.|The imagery in this verse of scorpion-like tails and their ability to harm suggests a spiritual reality where beings have power to inflict pain or suffering. This power is likened to the authority granted by Christ, implying a connection between the physical and the spiritual realms. The mention of five months aligns with a period of suffering that is both significant and limited, as seen in biblical symbolism.|
|REV 9:11|They have as their king the angel of the abyss; his name in Hebrew is Abaddon, and in Greek he has the name Apollyon.|The verse presents the concept of a ruler over the locust-like beings described in the preceding verses. The names 'Abaddon' and 'Apollyon' are significant as they convey meanings of destruction and destruction in Hebrew and Greek, respectively. This is reflected in the characterization of the being in charge of the abyss.|
|REV 9:12|The first woe has passed; behold, two more woes are coming after this.|In this verse, the term 'woe' indicates a strong lamentation or a pronouncement of impending disaster. The phrase 'two woes yet to come' emphasizes the urgency and severity of the judgment that is unfolding, continuing from the context of previous woes already experienced. The term 'come' suggests an imminent arrival of further tribulations following the first woe that has passed.|
|REV 9:13|Then the sixth angel sounded his trumpet; and I heard a voice coming from the four horns of the golden altar that is before God.|In this verse, the focus is on the sixth angel sounding a trumpet and the voice that comes from the horns of the golden altar, which is a significant location in the heavenly temple, symbolizing the presence of God and His judgments. The word 'trumpet' is crucial as it signifies the announcement of significant events or divine actions.|
|REV 9:14|saying to the sixth angel, the one who had the trumpet, 'Release the four angels who are bound at the great river Euphrates.'|This verse refers to the release of four angels that have been bound, specifically located by the great Euphrates River. This imagery emphasizes the connection between angels, their authority, and the significance of their location. The use of 'trumpet' aligns with the apocalyptic theme of the text, where each trumpet judgment heralds a specific divine act.|
|REV 9:15|So the four angels, who had been prepared for the exact hour, day, month, and year, were released to kill a third of mankind.|The phrase 'the four angels' emphasizes their significance in divine judgment, indicating they have been specifically prepared for this task. The reference to time ('the hour, the day, the month, and the year') reflects the precision of God's plan for judgment, emphasizing its certainty and divine timing. The outcome of their release is the death of a third of humanity, highlighting the severity of this judgment.|
|REV 9:16|And the number of the armies of the horsemen was two hundred million; I heard their number.|In this translation, I aim to capture the magnitude and majesty of the army described in Revelation 9:16, aligning it with similar scriptural references to vast numbers of heavenly beings. The phrase 'two hundred million' conveys the numerical sense while maintaining a literal connection to the original Greek text.|
|REV 9:17|Thus I saw the horses in the vision, and those who sat on them had breastplates of fiery red, hyacinth blue, and sulfur yellow; and the heads of the horses were like the heads of lions. From their mouths came fire and smoke and brimstone.|This verse presents a vivid image of the horsemen and their armor, drawing from Old Testament imagery of judgment and warfare. The colors of the armor (fire-red, blue, and sulfurous) symbolize destruction and divine judgment. The lion-like heads of the horses evoke power and ferocity, while the fire, smoke, and brimstone emerging from their mouths suggest catastrophic judgment, reminiscent of apocalyptic language found elsewhere in Scripture.|
|REV 9:18|By these three plagues, a third of mankind was killed: by the fire, the smoke, and the sulfur that came out of their mouths.|In this verse, the emphasis is on the catastrophic consequences of divine judgment, where a significant portion of humanity perishes due to the plagues. The words 'fire', 'smoke', and 'brimstone' evoke a vivid image of destruction associated with divine wrath, similar to imagery found in the Old Testament.|
|REV 9:19|For the power of the horses is in their mouths and in their tails; for their tails are like serpents, having heads, and with them they inflict harm.|In this verse, the imagery of the horses and their tails reflects the destructive power that is attributed to their mouths and tails. The tails are likened to serpents, emphasizing a deceitful and deadly nature. The choice of the word 'destructive' highlights the intention behind their actions. This translation seeks to capture both the literal meaning and the metaphorical implications of power and judgment.|
|REV 9:20|And the rest of mankind, who were not killed by these plagues, did not repent of the works of their hands, nor give up worshiping demons and idols of gold, silver, bronze, stone, and wood, which cannot see or hear or walk.|This verse highlights the persistent hardness of the hearts of those who witnessed the judgments of God but refused to repent. The emphasis is placed on the futility of worshiping idols, which are made by human hands and possess no real power or life.|
|REV 9:21|And they did not repent of their murders, nor of their sorceries, nor of their sexual immorality, nor of their thefts.|This verse highlights the obstinate nature of humanity in refusing to turn away from their sinful practices, despite the severe judgments they face. The terms 'murders,' 'sorceries,' 'fornication,' and 'thefts' represent the various sinful behaviors that are prevalent and lead to a lack of repentance. It echoes the theme of the call to repentance found throughout Scripture.|
