| Reference | Verse | Translation Notes |
|:---------:|-------|-------------------|
|REV 12:1|And a great sign appeared in heaven: a woman clothed with the sun, and the moon under her feet, and on her head a crown of twelve stars.|The verse depicts a grand sign in heaven with imagery that connects to themes of glory, royalty, and celestial bodies, evoking strong symbolism consistent throughout the biblical narrative. The woman is adorned with elements representing power and authority, reminiscent of motifs found in both the Old and New Testaments.|
|REV 12:2|And she was pregnant, crying out in the throes of childbirth and in great distress to give birth.|In this verse, the imagery of a woman in labor captures both the physical pain of childbirth and the intense longing for deliverance. The original Greek conveys a sense of distress and struggle, emphasizing the seriousness of her condition as she prepares to give birth. This metaphor aligns with themes of creation, pain, and hope found throughout scripture.|
|REV 12:3|And another sign appeared in heaven: behold, a great red dragon, having seven heads and ten horns, and on his heads seven diadems.|In this verse, the imagery of a great red dragon with seven heads and ten horns is pivotal to the narrative of Revelation. The terms 'dragon', 'red', 'great', 'heads', and 'horns' convey not only a literal creature but also symbolic meanings associated with power, authority, and opposition to God. The mention of crowns or diadems suggests a false authority, contrasting with the true sovereignty of God. This imagery builds on the themes of conflict between good and evil in the apocalyptic literature.|
|REV 12:4|And his tail swept away a third of the stars of heaven, and he hurled them to the earth. The dragon stood in front of the woman who was about to give birth, so that when she bore her child, he might devour it.|In this verse, the imagery of the dragon's tail sweeping a third of the stars from heaven conveys a sense of dramatic fall and divine conflict. The choice of words like 'dragon' and 'stars' draws from a rich biblical tradition that portrays cosmic battles and the fate of heavenly beings.|
|REV 12:5|And she bore a son, a male child, who is to rule all the nations with a rod of iron; and her child was caught up to God and to His throne.|The term for 'male child' in Greek emphasizes the significance of the child being a son, which holds theological weight in the context of prophecy and the fulfillment of God's plan. The imagery of ruling with a 'rod of iron' signifies authority and the exercise of power over nations, which is a theme woven throughout the scriptures, especially in messianic texts.|
|REV 12:6|And the woman fled into the wilderness, where she has a place prepared by God, that they should nourish her there for one thousand two hundred sixty days.|This verse emphasizes God's provision for the woman in a place of refuge, highlighting themes of divine preparation and sustenance in times of trial. The imagery of wilderness reflects the broader biblical context of God's care for His people in desolate places.|
|REV 12:7|And war broke out in heaven; Michael and his angels fought against the dragon, and the dragon and his angels fought back.|This verse describes a celestial battle between Michael and his angels against the dragon and his angels. It signifies a pivotal spiritual conflict, reflecting themes found throughout the Bible regarding the struggle between good and evil, particularly involving Michael, a key figure in spiritual warfare.|
|REV 12:8|And he could not prevail, nor was there any place found for him in heaven any longer.|In this verse, the phrase 'no longer' is critical to convey the idea that the dragon's influence has been completely expelled from heaven. The phrase 'was found' reflects the inability of the dragon to establish any foothold in heaven following the defeat. The use of 'place' emphasizes the absence of any domain or authority remaining for the dragon in that heavenly realm.|
|REV 12:9|And the dragon was cast down, that ancient serpent, who is called the Devil and Satan, the one deceiving the whole world; he was thrown down to the earth, and his angels were cast out with him.|In this verse, the imagery of the dragon represents the ultimate evil, and it reflects the cosmic battle between good and evil. The names used for the dragon—Devil and Satan—highlight its deceptive nature and role as an adversary to humanity. The use of 'the whole world' indicates the global reach of this evil influence. The phrase 'cast down' suggests a decisive defeat, which is a recurring theme in Revelation, depicting the ultimate triumph of God over evil.|
|REV 12:10|And I heard a loud voice in heaven proclaiming, 'Now has come the salvation and the power and the kingdom of our God, and the authority of His Christ; for the accuser of our brothers has been cast down, who accuses them before our God day and night.'|This verse speaks to the triumph of God's salvation and power, highlighting the casting down of the accuser, which emphasizes the victory of Christ and the establishment of God's Kingdom. The key terms like 'salvation', 'power', and 'kingdom' are central to understanding the significance of this moment in heaven.|
|REV 12:11|And they triumphed over him by the blood of the Lamb and by the word of their testimony; they did not love their lives so much as to shrink from death.|In this verse, the phrase 'they overcame him' signifies a victorious struggle against evil through divine assistance. The phrase 'by the blood of the Lamb' emphasizes the significance of Christ's sacrifice, while 'by the word of their testimony' underlines the power of witnessing one's faith. The last part reflects the ultimate commitment of believers, showing that they were willing to sacrifice their lives for their faith, resonating with the themes of perseverance and devotion throughout the New Testament.|
|REV 12:12|Therefore, rejoice, you heavens, and all who dwell in them! Woe to the earth and the sea, for the devil has come down to you with great wrath, knowing that he has but a short time."|In this verse, the call to rejoice is directed at the heavens, contrasting with the warning of woe to the earth and sea due to the presence of the devil, who is aware of his limited time. The translation aims to reflect the gravity of the situation while preserving the encouragement for those in heaven.|
|REV 12:13|And when the dragon saw that he had been thrown down to the earth, he pursued the woman who had given birth to the male child.|In this verse, the dragon, representing Satan, reacts to being cast down to the earth by pursuing the woman who gave birth to the male child (representing Christ). The language conveys the urgency and hostility of the dragon's pursuit. The term 'pursued' captures the essence of the dragon's relentless effort against the woman, emphasizing both the gravity of the situation and the protective element present in the preceding and following verses.|
|REV 12:14|And to the woman were given two wings of the great eagle, that she might fly into the wilderness, to her place, where she is nourished for a time, times, and half a time, from the face of the serpent.|This verse uses the imagery of wings to convey protection and escape. The mention of a great eagle symbolizes divine aid, reflecting the care God has for His people. The reference to the wilderness indicates a place of refuge and preparation amidst trials.|
|REV 12:15|And the serpent poured out from his mouth water like a river after the woman, so that he might sweep her away with the flood.|This verse describes the serpent's attack on the woman through the imagery of water as a flood, which signifies a powerful and overwhelming force. The use of 'river' parallels other biblical depictions of adversarial forces seeking to overtake God's people. The intent is to emphasize the severity and relentless nature of the serpent's pursuit.|
|REV 12:16|But the earth helped the woman, and the earth opened its mouth and swallowed the river that the dragon had poured out from his mouth.|In this verse, the earth plays a crucial role as a divine instrument that aids the woman by swallowing the flood sent by the dragon. This translation emphasizes the protective aspect of the earth while maintaining the original imagery of the dragon's attack. The phrase 'opened its mouth' captures the act of the earth intervening directly in the cosmic conflict between good and evil.|
|REV 12:17|And the dragon became enraged with the woman and went off to make war against the rest of her offspring, those who keep the commandments of God and hold to the testimony of Jesus.|The translation captures the themes of the dragon's anger towards the woman, the subsequent warfare against her offspring, and emphasizes the importance of keeping God's commandments and holding fast to the testimony of Jesus. The term 'dragon' symbolically represents evil opposition, while 'the woman' signifies the faithful people of God, and 'the offspring' indicates those who follow Christ. The phrasing seeks to convey the intensity of the conflict and the steadfastness required of believers.|
