The source of this water is notably divine, originating from the throne of God and the Lamb, which signifies its sacred nature and life-giving properties.|
|REV 22:2|In the midst of the city square and along the river, on both sides, was the tree of life, bearing twelve kinds of fruit, yielding its fruit each month; and the leaves of the tree were for the healing of the nations.|The phrase 'tree of life' (ξύλον ζωῆς) evokes imagery of sustenance and healing, prominent throughout Scripture. This translation emphasizes the abundance and continual provision from the tree, reflecting its life-giving properties. The mention of twelve fruits corresponds to the completeness and perfection often associated with divine provision.|

|REV 22:8|I, John, the one who heard and saw these things, fell down to worship before the feet of the angel who showed them to me.|In this verse, John acknowledges both his role as the witness of the visions and his human response to divine revelation.

The repetition of 'let him' indicates a strong exhortation towards the natural consequences of one's actions and character.
