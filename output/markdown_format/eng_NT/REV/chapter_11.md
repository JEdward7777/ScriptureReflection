|:---------:|-------|-------------------|
|REV 11:1|And a measuring rod like a staff was given to me, saying, 'Rise and measure the temple of God, the altar, and those who worship there.'|The term 'calamus' or 'measuring reed' is consistent with ancient practices of measurement in both religious and secular contexts. Here, it signifies the act of measuring the temple, a metaphor for God's judgment and evaluation of worship. The phrase 'those who worship therein' underscores the importance of worship in relation to the temple's sanctity.|
|REV 11:2|But exclude the outer court of the temple; do not measure it, for it has been given over to the nations, and they will trample the holy city for forty-two months.|In this verse, the distinction between the inner sanctum of the temple and the outer court is significant, reflecting a separation of sacred and profane spaces. The phrase 'given to the nations' implies a period of dominion over the holy city, emphasizing the tribulations faced by the faithful.|
|REV 11:3|And I will give authority to my two witnesses, and they will prophesy for one thousand two hundred sixty days, clothed in sackcloth.|The phrase 'two witnesses' indicates a significant duality in testimony, reminiscent of other biblical instances where two or more witnesses establish truth. The period of '1260 days' corresponds to a symbolic time frame often seen in apocalyptic literature, representing a complete yet challenging period of witness and trial. The use of 'sackcloth' signifies mourning and a call for repentance, aligning with the prophets' traditional role of warning and proclamation.|
|REV 11:4|These are the two olive trees and the two lampstands that stand before the Lord of the earth.|The phrase 'two olive trees' is significant in biblical symbolism, representing anointing and God's provision. The 'two lampstands' refer to the presence of God's light among His people. This verse establishes the authority and the divine purpose of the two witnesses in Revelation, paralleling the imagery of light and provision from the Old Testament.|
|REV 11:5|And if anyone seeks to harm them, fire comes forth from their mouths and consumes their enemies; and if anyone would harm them, thus must he be killed.|This translation emphasizes the divine authority and the protective power of the two witnesses, portraying their ability to bring judgment against those who seek to harm them through imagery of consuming fire, consistent with biblical themes of judgment and divine retribution.|
|REV 11:6|These two witnesses have the authority to shut the sky, so that no rain falls during the days of their prophecy; and they have authority over the waters to turn them into blood, and to strike the earth with every kind of plague as often as they desire.|This verse describes the authority given to the two witnesses during the prophetic period, emphasizing their power over natural elements and their ability to enact plagues. The mention of 'closing the heavens' parallels with the Old Testament narrative of Elijah, while the authority to turn waters into blood evokes the plagues of Egypt.|
|REV 11:7|And when they have completed their testimony, the beast that rises from the abyss will make war on them and conquer them, and kill them.|This verse depicts a dramatic confrontation between the two witnesses and the beast rising from the abyss. The term 'beast' carries connotations of evil and opposition to God, which aligns with the themes of persecution found throughout Revelation. The phrase 'make war' emphasizes the intensity of the conflict, while 'prevail' and 'kill' highlight the seriousness of the threat faced by the witnesses.|
|REV 11:8|And their dead bodies will lie in the street of the great city, which is symbolically called Sodom and Egypt, where also their Lord was crucified.|The original Greek text employs vivid imagery, referencing Sodom and Egypt to denote spiritual depravity and rebellion against God. The choice of the word 'body' in this translation is to maintain the gravity of their death and its public exposure in a prominent location. The phrase 'where their Lord was crucified' underscores the connection to Christ’s sacrifice and its significance in the context of the prophetic witnesses' fate.|
|REV 11:9|And people from the nations and tribes and tongues and peoples will gaze at their lifeless bodies for three and a half days, and they will not permit their corpses to be laid in a tomb.|This verse highlights the public spectacle of the two witnesses' bodies lying in the street, viewed by many from various nations and languages, emphasizing both the global attention and the indignity of their treatment after death. The language evokes themes of mourning and the global consequences of their testimony.|
|REV 11:10|And those who dwell on the earth will rejoice over them and be glad, and they will send gifts to one another, because these two prophets had tormented those who dwell on the earth.|The verse expresses the reaction of the inhabitants of the earth to the death of the two witnesses. The use of 'rejoice' and 'send gifts' signifies a deep animosity towards these prophets, highlighting the stark contrast between the world's joy and the prophetic message they delivered. The Greek term for 'prophètes' is directly related to the act of proclaiming God's message, which was met with disdain by those who rejected it. The phrases 'those who dwell on the earth' and 'the two prophets' are important as they symbolize the two witnesses and their relationship to the larger narrative of judgment and rejection in Revelation.|
|REV 11:11|But after three and a half days, the breath of life from God entered them, and they stood on their feet; and great fear fell upon those who saw them.|The verse describes a moment of miraculous resurrection and empowerment, echoing themes of divine life and fear instilled in witnesses. The translation maintains a balance of fidelity to the original Greek while ensuring clarity and resonance in English.|
|REV 11:12|And I heard a loud voice from heaven saying to them, 'Come up here.' And they ascended to heaven in a cloud, while their enemies watched them.|This verse describes a divine command leading to the ascension of witnesses to heaven. The imagery of a cloud is often associated with God's presence and majesty, which aligns with similar ascension themes in other biblical texts.|
|REV 11:13|And in that day, a great earthquake occurred, and a tenth of the city fell, and seven thousand names of men were killed in the earthquake; and the rest were terrified and gave glory to the God of heaven.|This verse describes a significant event marked by a great earthquake that resulted in widespread destruction and loss of life. The number of deaths (seven thousand) and the reaction of the survivors reflect both judgment and the acknowledgment of God's sovereignty. The phrase 'gave glory to God' implies a recognition of divine power in the face of calamity.|
|REV 11:14|The second woe has passed; behold, the third woe is coming swiftly.|In this verse, 'Woe' signifies a grave judgment or disaster, commonly used throughout Revelation to highlight severe warnings. The structure mirrors that of prophetic announcements, emphasizing the urgency and certainty of what is to come, using the term 'third woe' to indicate a pivotal moment in the narrative.|
|REV 11:15|And the seventh angel sounded the trumpet; and there were loud voices in heaven saying: 'The kingdom of this world has become the kingdom of our Lord and of His Christ, and He shall reign forever and ever!'|This translation captures the essence of the verse, emphasizing the transition to the reign of God's kingdom and Christ's everlasting kingship. The word 'kingdom' is rendered consistently to maintain the theological significance of God's sovereignty.|
|REV 11:16|And the twenty-four elders who sit before God on their thrones fell on their faces and worshiped God.|In this verse, the act of worship and the imagery of elders before God's throne is emphasized, reflecting the ultimate authority and divinity of God. The verb 'fell' signifies deep reverence, while 'worship' conveys the acknowledgment of God's majesty.|
|REV 11:17|saying, ‘We give thanks to You, Lord God Almighty, who is and who was, for You have taken Your great power and begun to reign.’|In this verse, the term "the Almighty" emphasizes God's supreme authority and omnipotence.

This verse captures the essence of gratitude and acknowledgment of God's sovereignty, aligning with the worshipful context of the previous verse.|
|REV 11:18|And the nations were enraged, and Your wrath has come, and the time has come for the nations to be judged, and to give reward to Your servants the prophets and to the saints, to those who fear Your name, both small and great, and to destroy those who destroy the earth.|This verse speaks of divine retribution against the nations, the timing of God's judgment, and the rewards for His servants. It emphasizes the distinction between those who serve God and those who corrupt the earth, underscoring both accountability and justice.|
|REV 11:19|Then the temple of God in heaven was opened, and the Ark of His Covenant was seen within His temple; and there were flashes of lightning, voices, thunders, an earthquake, and great hail.|This verse depicts a heavenly vision where the temple of God is opened, revealing the Ark of the Covenant, symbolizing God's presence and covenant with His people. The description of lightnings, voices, thunders, an earthquake, and great hail reflects God's power and judgment, consistent with apocalyptic themes.|
