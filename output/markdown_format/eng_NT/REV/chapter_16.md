|REV 16:5|And I heard the angel of the waters saying, "You are righteous, O One who is and who was, the Holy One, for you have judged these things."|This verse emphasizes the righteousness of God in judgment. The phrases 'you are righteous' and 'the one who is and who was' refer to God's eternal nature and moral integrity.

The comparison to frogs is kept intact as it indicates the disgusting and unclean nature of these spirits, echoing the symbolism found in the plagues of Egypt. The imagery reflects the pervasive and deceitful influence of these entities in the eschatological context.|
|REV 16:14|For they are spirits of demons performing signs, which go out to the kings of the whole world, to gather them together for the battle of that great day of God Almighty.|In this verse, we are witnessing the manipulation of earthly kings by demonic spirits to unite them in a climactic confrontation.

|REV 16:21|And great hail, as heavy as talents, fell from heaven upon men; and men blasphemed God because of the plague of the hail, for the plague was exceedingly great.|This verse captures the severe consequence of divine judgment through the imagery of great hail, which serves as a sign of God's power.
