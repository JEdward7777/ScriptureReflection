|:---------:|-------|-------------------|
|REV 20:1|And I saw an angel coming down from heaven, holding the key to the abyss and a great chain in his hand.|This verse introduces a significant angelic figure with authority over the abyss, represented through the metaphor of keys and chains, which emphasize control and restraint over evil. The use of the term 'abyss' here is consistent with its usage in other biblical passages that refer to a place of confinement for demonic beings.|
|REV 20:2|And he seized the dragon, that ancient serpent, who is the Devil and Satan, the one who deceives the world; and he bound him for a thousand years.|In this verse, the action of seizing or holding the dragon connects with themes of authority and judgment. The term 'ancient serpent' is a reference to the primordial deception in the garden. The names 'Devil' and 'Satan' encapsulate the role of the adversary in the cosmic conflict. The phrase 'bound for a thousand years' indicates a significant period of restraint against evil, highlighting the ultimate triumph of God's kingdom.|
|REV 20:3|And he threw him into the abyss, and shut it, and sealed it over him, so that he would no longer deceive the nations until the thousand years were completed; after these things he must be released for a little while.|In this verse, the use of 'abyss' refers to a place of confinement for evil, consistent with other uses in the Bible. The act of sealing indicates a definitive closure that prevents further action, emphasizing the temporary nature of this restraint. The phrase 'for a little while' reflects the transient period of confinement after the thousand years, hinting at the eventual release of the adversary.|
|REV 20:4|And I saw thrones, and they sat upon them, and judgment was given to them. And the souls of those who had been beheaded for their testimony of Jesus and for the word of God, and who had not worshiped the beast or its image, and had not received its mark on their foreheads or their hands; and they lived and reigned with Christ for a thousand years.|In this translation, attention is paid to the concepts of thrones, judgment, and resurrection, which are pivotal themes in the passage. The phrasing is intended to capture the original intent while being accessible and clear in modern English.|
|REV 20:5|And the rest of the dead did not come to life until the thousand years were completed. This is the first resurrection.|In this verse, 'the rest of the dead' refers to those who did not partake in the first resurrection. The phrase 'until the thousand years were completed' emphasizes the distinct timeline of the first resurrection compared to others. This verse establishes a clear distinction between those who have experienced resurrection and those awaiting it.|
|REV 20:6|Blessed and holy is the one who has part in the first resurrection; over such, the second death has no power, but they shall be priests of God and of Christ, and shall reign with Him for a thousand years.|In this verse, 'blessed' (μακάριος) denotes a state of divine favor, emphasizing the joy and holiness of those participating in the first resurrection. The term 'holy' (ἅγιος) highlights their consecration and set-apart status. The concept of 'the second death' reinforces the idea of eternal life granted to those who share in this resurrection, while the imagery of reigning and priesthood reflects the authority and service of the believers in God's kingdom.|
|REV 20:7|And when the thousand years are completed, Satan will be released from his prison.|This verse highlights the moment when the imprisonment of Satan, lasting a thousand years, comes to an end. The choice of words reflects the sense of completion and subsequent release, indicating a pivotal point in eschatological events.|
|REV 20:8|And he will go out to deceive the nations that are in the four corners of the earth, Gog and Magog, to gather them for battle, whose number is like the sand of the sea.|This verse depicts a future scenario where Satan, having been released, will lead the nations into a great deception and gather them for battle, specifically invoking the figures of Gog and Magog which are tied to prophetic imagery of conflict and judgment. The imagery of gathering nations as numerous as the sands of the sea signifies an overwhelming force united against God’s people.|
|REV 20:9|And they ascended over the breadth of the earth, and surrounded the camp of the saints and the beloved city; but fire came down from God out of heaven and consumed them.|This translation captures the imagery of encirclement and divine judgment as seen in the original Greek text. The term 'camp of the saints' is translated to convey the protected assembly of God's people, and the act of fire coming down from heaven symbolizes God's judgment upon those who oppose Him.|
|REV 20:10|And the devil, who deceived them, was thrown into the lake of fire and brimstone, where the beast and the false prophet are; and they will be tormented day and night forever and ever.|The phrase 'lake of fire and brimstone' emphasizes the severity of the punishment reserved for the devil and his followers, illustrating an eternal state of torment. The word 'devil' is derived from 'διάβολος,' denoting the accuser or slanderer, highlighting the role of Satan in deceiving humanity. 'Tormented day and night' reflects the unending nature of the suffering, denoting both temporal and spiritual distress.|
|REV 20:11|And I saw a great white throne, and the One who sat upon it; from whose presence the earth and the sky fled away, and no place was found for them.|In this translation, the imagery of a great white throne emphasizes the purity and authority of the judgment that is about to take place. The phrase 'the earth and the sky fled away' suggests the ultimate authority of God, making it clear that nothing can stand in His presence, which ties to the themes of judgment and divine power.|
|REV 20:12|And I saw the dead, great and small, standing before the throne, and books were opened; and another book was opened, which is the Book of Life. The dead were judged according to what they had done as recorded in the books.|This verse emphasizes the scene of judgment where all the dead, both great and small, stand before God. It introduces the concept of the 'books' being opened, symbolizing the recording of deeds, and highlights the significance of the 'Book of Life'. The structure is designed to convey the awe of the judgment day, the equality of all before the throne, and the ultimate reckoning based on their works.|
|REV 20:13|And the sea gave up the dead that were in it, and death and Hades surrendered the dead that were in them, and each was judged according to their deeds.|This verse emphasizes the resurrection of the dead from different realms, indicating that all who have died will be resurrected and face judgment based on their deeds. The phrasing captures the profound solemnity of divine judgment, aligning with the broader themes of accountability found throughout Scripture.|
|REV 20:14|And death and Hades were thrown into the lake of fire. This is the second death.|In this verse, the concept of 'death' is associated with finality, particularly the second death which is the eternal separation from God. The term 'lake of fire' is a significant symbol of ultimate judgment. It emphasizes the severity of the punishment for those who are not redeemed. The structure parallels that of previous verses, reaffirming the seriousness of judgment after death and Hades are cast away.|
|REV 20:15|And if anyone’s name was not found written in the book of life, he was thrown into the lake of fire.|The phrase 'the book of life' signifies the divine record of those who will receive eternal life.
