|:---------:|-------|-------------------|
|REV 13:1|And I stood upon the sand of the sea, and I saw a beast rising up out of the sea, having ten horns and seven heads, and upon his horns ten crowns, and upon his heads the names of blasphemy.|In this verse, the imagery of the beast emerging from the sea evokes themes of chaos and power. The ten horns symbolize complete authority, while the seven heads may represent completeness or universality. The crowns (diadems) on the horns signify rulership, and the blasphemous names suggest opposition to God.|
|REV 13:2|And the beast that I saw was like a leopard, its feet were like those of a bear, and its mouth was like the mouth of a lion. The dragon gave it his power, his throne, and great authority.|The imagery in Revelation 13:2 draws heavily from the symbolism of ferocity and strength seen in previous scriptures. The use of animals such as the leopard, bear, and lion indicates a powerful and fearsome creature. The mention of the dragon giving authority implies a dark power at work, which is further emphasized through the blend of different beast characteristics to reflect an amalgamation of evil forces.|
|REV 13:3|One of its heads seemed to be wounded fatally, but its deadly wound was healed. And the whole earth marveled and followed the beast.|This translation captures the imagery of a head that appears to have been mortally wounded but is healed, signifying a miraculous recovery that causes widespread astonishment. The use of 'as though it had been slain' evokes strong connections to sacrificial themes prevalent in biblical texts.|
|REV 13:4|And they worshiped the dragon who gave authority to the beast; and they worshiped the beast, saying, 'Who is like the beast? Who is able to make war against it?'|This verse emphasizes the act of worship directed towards the dragon and the beast, underscoring the themes of idolatry and allegiance to power. The rhetorical questions highlight the awe and fear of the beast’s might, making it clear that it stands in stark opposition to the worship of God.|
|REV 13:5|And there was given to him a mouth speaking great things and blasphemies; and authority was given to him to continue for forty-two months.|This verse describes the authority and blasphemous speech given to the beast, paralleling the themes of power and defiance found throughout Scripture. The term 'forty-two months' reflects a period of time significant in apocalyptic literature, symbolizing a period of oppression.|
|REV 13:6|And he opened his mouth to speak blasphemies against God, to blaspheme His name and His dwelling, those who dwell in heaven.|This verse depicts the opening of the mouth of the beast to blaspheme God, reflecting both the authority and opposition it represents. The term 'blasphemy' suggests a direct attack on the divine character and honor of God, as well as His dwelling among the faithful in heaven.|
|REV 13:7|And it was granted to him to make war with the saints and to overcome them, and authority was given to him over every tribe and people and language and nation.|This verse emphasizes the authority granted to the beast to wage war against the saints and suggests a time of tribulation for the faithful. The words 'war' and 'authority' are significant in the context of spiritual warfare. The translation seeks to convey the weight of the oppression faced by believers in the face of the beast's dominion.|
|REV 13:8|And all who dwell on the earth will worship him, whose names have not been written in the Book of Life of the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world.|The term 'the Lamb who was slain' refers to Christ, emphasizing His sacrificial role. The phrase 'from the foundation of the world' underscores the eternal plan of God regarding salvation and judgment.|
|REV 13:9|If anyone has an ear, let him hear!|This verse employs a common biblical idiom that emphasizes the importance of listening and understanding spiritual truths. The phrase 'He who has ears to hear' is used throughout Scripture to call attention to the need for discernment in the message being conveyed.|
|REV 13:10|If anyone is destined for captivity, to captivity he goes; if anyone kills with the sword, by the sword he must be killed. Here is the perseverance and faith of the saints.|This verse serves as a somber reminder of the cost of discipleship. It reflects the justice that is meted out in the spiritual battle against evil, emphasizing the necessity for endurance and faith amidst trials. The phrase ‘he who goes into captivity’ suggests a consequence for those who follow the ways of the world, while ‘he who kills with the sword’ emphasizes the return of divine justice upon those who commit violence.|
|REV 13:11|Then I saw another beast rising out of the earth. It had two horns like a lamb, but it spoke like a dragon.|The imagery of a beast rising from the earth suggests a creature of deception and false authority. The 'two horns like a lamb' indicate a semblance of innocence or righteousness, while speaking like a dragon reveals its true nature of deceit and power. This verse encapsulates the duality of false prophets and their allure.|
|REV 13:12|And it exercises all the authority of the first beast in its presence. And it makes the earth and those who dwell in it worship the first beast, whose deadly wound was healed.|This verse highlights the authority of the second beast, which acts on behalf of the first beast and leads people to worship it, emphasizing the theme of false worship that runs throughout the Book of Revelation.|
|REV 13:13|And it performs great signs, making fire come down from heaven to earth in the sight of people.|The phrase 'makes great signs' implies the performance of miraculous acts that aim to captivate or deceive the onlookers. The mention of fire coming down from heaven serves as a powerful symbol, reminiscent of divine acts in the Old Testament, and highlights the significance of the spectacle to sway the masses.|
|REV 13:14|And he deceives those who dwell on the earth through the signs that were given to him to perform in the presence of the beast, telling those who dwell on the earth to make an image for the beast, who had the wound by the sword and lived.|This verse highlights the deceptive nature of the beast and its ability to perform signs that lead people astray. The language emphasizes the authority given to the beast to create an image and instill worship among the inhabitants of the earth, drawing parallels with other scriptural references to false prophets and signs.|
|REV 13:15|And it was granted to him to give breath to the image of the beast, so that the image of the beast might speak and cause those who would not worship the image of the beast to be killed.|In this verse, the focus is on the giving of spirit or life to the image of the beast, enabling it to speak and act, which leads to the condemnation of those who do not worship it. The phrase 'image of the beast' directly connects with the idea of false worship and idolatry, reminiscent of the prohibitions against graven images found in the Old Testament. The term 'kill' emphasizes the consequence of not adhering to this false worship, highlighting the ultimate conflict between divine truth and deception.|
|REV 13:16|And he causes all, both small and great, both rich and poor, both free and slave, to be given a mark on their right hand or on their foreheads.|This verse highlights the universal reach of the beast's authority, targeting all classes and statuses of people. The specific mention of receiving a mark on the right hand or forehead suggests a forced allegiance that signifies both submission and identification with the beast's power.|
