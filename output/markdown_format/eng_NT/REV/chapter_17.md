|REV 17:1|Then one of the seven angels who had the seven bowls came and spoke with me, saying, 'Come, I will show you the judgment of the great harlot who sits upon many waters.'|In this verse, the focus is on the interaction between the angel and John, as well as the revelation of the judgment upon the great harlot, symbolizing a significant theme of corruption and judgment in Revelation. The phrase 'the great harlot' (πορνης της μεγαλης) carries the implication of both literal and metaphorical fornication, representing unfaithfulness to God.|
|REV 17:2|With whom the kings of the earth have committed fornication, and the inhabitants of the earth have been made drunk with the wine of her fornication.|In this verse, the imagery of fornication symbolizes the unfaithfulness of nations and rulers towards God, where they have engaged in idolatrous practices. The 'wine of her fornication' suggests a seductive influence that leads to moral corruption and intoxication with sin. This translation aims to capture the depth of this metaphor while remaining faithful to the original text.|
|REV 17:3|And he carried me away in the Spirit into the wilderness. And I saw a woman sitting on a scarlet beast, full of names of blasphemy, having seven heads and ten horns.|In this translation, I have preserved the essence of the original Greek text while ensuring clarity and readability in English. The imagery of the 'woman' and the 'beast' is central to this vision and reflects themes of temptation and spiritual conflict present throughout the book of Revelation.|

The terms used are chosen to evoke a sense of both beauty and corruption, in alignment with the overarching themes of Revelation.|
|REV 17:5|And upon her forehead was written a name: Mystery, Babylon the Great, the Mother of Fornications and of the Abominations of the Earth.|This translation seeks to convey the original Greek terminology while maintaining clarity in English.

I will explain to you the mystery of the woman and of the beast that carries her, which has the seven heads and ten horns."|In this translation, I aimed to convey the sense of awe and the complexity of the vision regarding the woman and the beast. The use of 'mystery' reflects the original Greek 'μυστήριον,' which signifies something hidden that is now being disclosed. The term 'beast' is chosen here to align with the traditional imagery used throughout the Book of Revelation, while maintaining clarity about the relationship between the woman and the beast.|
|REV 17:8|The beast that you saw was, and is not, and is about to ascend from the abyss and go to destruction. And those who dwell on the earth will marvel, whose names have not been written in the Book of Life from the foundation of the world, when they see the beast that was, and is not, and yet is.|This verse emphasizes the enigmatic nature of the beast, its previous existence, and impending destruction, capturing the bewilderment of those whose names are not recorded in the Book of Life.

The use of 'going to perdition' underscores the ultimate destiny of the beast as one of destruction.|
|REV 17:12|And the ten horns that you saw are ten kings who have not yet received a kingdom, but they will receive authority as kings for one hour, along with the beast.|In this verse, the reference to the ten horns symbolizes ten kings who have yet to receive authority.
