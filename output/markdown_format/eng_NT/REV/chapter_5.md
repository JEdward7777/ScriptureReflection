|REV 5:1|And I saw in the right hand of Him who sat on the throne a scroll written inside and on the back, sealed with seven seals.|In this verse, the imagery of the book and its seals carries significant theological meaning, representing divine revelation that is both hidden and revealed. The use of the term 'right hand' indicates power and authority, a common biblical theme.

|REV 5:2|And I saw a mighty angel proclaiming with a loud voice, 'Who is worthy to open the scroll and break its seals?'|The original Greek text speaks of a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice, asking who is worthy to open the scroll and break its seals. This translation aims to convey the urgency and significance of the proclamation made by the angel.|
|REV 5:3|And no one in heaven, nor on the earth, nor under the earth was able to open the scroll or even to look at it.|This verse emphasizes the unworthiness of all beings to open the scroll, signifying the importance of Christ as the only one capable of fulfilling God's plan. The structure of the sentence highlights the exclusivity of the ability to open the scroll, drawing from the original text's focus on three realms: heaven, earth, and beneath the earth.|
|REV 5:4|And I began to weep bitterly, because no one was found worthy to open the scroll or to look into it.|In this verse, John expresses deep sorrow because no one was found worthy to open the scroll. The use of 'wept much' emphasizes his emotional response to the situation. The structure reflects the severity of the moment, as it conveys a sense of despair and the weight of the situation in heaven, mirroring the prophetic and apocalyptic tone of the surrounding passages.|
|REV 5:5|And one of the elders said to me, 'Do not weep; behold, the Lion of the tribe of Judah, the Root of David, has prevailed to open the scroll and its seven seals.'|This translation emphasizes the victory of Christ as the Lion of Judah and the fulfillment of Old Testament prophecy. The imagery of 'Lion' and 'Root' is crucial in connecting Jesus to His lineage and divine authority.|
|REV 5:6|And I looked, and behold, in the midst of the throne and of the four living creatures, and in the midst of the elders, stood a Lamb as though it had been slain, having seven horns and seven eyes, which are the seven spirits of God sent out into all the earth.|The imagery of the 'Lamb' as a representation of Jesus emphasizes His sacrificial nature and His role as the Redeemer. The reference to 'seven horns' symbolizes His omnipotence, while the 'seven eyes' denote His perfect knowledge and insight, which are linked to the 'seven spirits of God.' This verse encapsulates the theme of Christ's authority and His complete awareness of the earth.|
