|COL 3:1|If then you have been raised with Christ, seek the things that are above, where Christ is seated at the right hand of God.|In this verse, 'if then you were raised with Christ' implies a spiritual resurrection that transforms the believer's focus. The phrase 'seek those things that are above' emphasizes the pursuit of spiritual matters over earthly concerns. The wording reflects the original Greek structure while maintaining clarity and coherence in English.|
|COL 3:2|Set your minds on things that are above, not on things that are on the earth.|In this verse, the directive to focus on 'things that are above' contrasts with earthly concerns. The verb used suggests a mindset or mental focus, emphasizing spiritual priorities over worldly distractions.|

Words such as 'fornication', 'uncleanness', 'passion', 'evil desire', and 'covetousness' are used to highlight specific sins that are harmful and should be abandoned.|
|COL 3:6|Because of these things, the wrath of God is coming upon the children of disobedience.|The term 'wrath' is used in various contexts to signify God's judgment against sin, particularly emphasizing the consequences of disobedience. This translation maintains the focus on divine justice in relation to human conduct, paralleling the concept of idolatry as a significant issue.|
|COL 3:7|In these things you also once walked, when you were living in them.|The phrase 'in which' refers to the previous sins mentioned, linking it directly to the actions and life lived before turning to Christ. The emphasis is on the past nature of those behaviors, illustrating a change that occurs upon accepting faith in Christ.|
|COL 3:8|But now you must also put away all these: anger, rage, malice, slander, and filthy language from your mouth.|This translation emphasizes the need for believers to actively discard negative traits and behaviors that contradict the character of Christ, aligning with the broader theme of sanctification and moral integrity found in Paul's letters.|
|COL 3:9|Do not lie to one another, since you have taken off your old self with its practices.|In this verse, the Apostle Paul admonishes believers to abandon deception among one another, highlighting the need for authenticity within the community.

The term 'forgiving' reflects both an action and a disposition of the heart that aligns with the teachings of Christ throughout the New Testament.|
|COL 3:14|And above all these virtues, put on love, which is the tie that binds everything together in perfect harmony.|In this verse, the emphasis is on love as the ultimate unifying force that perfects all virtues and binds believers together.

This translation seeks to encapsulate the affectionate nature that should characterize the relationship between husbands and wives, encouraging an atmosphere of mutual respect and care.|
|COL 3:20|Children, obey your parents in all things, for this is pleasing to the Lord.|The phrase 'κατὰ πάντα' is rendered as 'in all things' to convey the broad scope of obedience expected from children towards their parents.

The phrase 'μὴ ἐν ὀφθαλμοδουλίαις' (not by way of eye-service) suggests sincerity and genuine commitment rather than merely working to be seen or praised.

Therefore, the translation captures both the directive for service and the spiritual underpinning behind it.|
