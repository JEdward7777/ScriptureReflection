| Reference | Verse | Translation Notes |
|:---------:|-------|-------------------|
|COL 2:1|For I want you to know how great a struggle I have on your behalf, and for those in Laodicea, and for all who have not seen my face in the flesh.|In this verse, Paul expresses a deep concern for the Colossians and others in Laodicea, emphasizing the struggle and effort he has invested for their spiritual well-being. The original Greek word 'ἀγῶνα' (agon) denotes a contest or struggle, which reflects Paul's passionate commitment to their growth in faith despite not having met them in person.|
|COL 2:2|that their hearts may be encouraged, being knit together in love, and attaining to all the riches of the full assurance of understanding, to the knowledge of the mystery of God, both of the Father and of Christ.|This verse emphasizes the unity and strength of the hearts of believers, rooted in love, and emphasizes the depth of knowledge found in understanding the mystery of God and Christ. Key terms such as 'hearts', 'love', 'wealth of understanding', and 'knowledge' are integral to capturing the essence of the text.|
|COL 2:3|in whom are hidden all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge.|In this verse, the focus is on the hidden treasures of wisdom and knowledge that are found in Christ. The Greek term 'ἀπόκρυφοι' conveys the idea of something being concealed or not immediately apparent, emphasizing the richness of understanding available in Him. This reflects the broader theme of the Apostle Paul's letters regarding the supremacy of Christ in all things.|
|COL 2:4|I say this so that no one may deceive you with persuasive arguments.|The phrase 'μή τις ὑμᾶς παραλογίζηται' conveys a warning against being led astray or deceived by persuasive arguments. The translation emphasizes the intent of the original text to caution the audience about false reasoning and speculation.|
|COL 2:5|For although I am absent in body, yet I am with you in spirit, rejoicing to see your good order and the steadfastness of your faith in Christ.|In this verse, Paul expresses his spiritual connection to the Colossians, emphasizing that even though he is absent in body, he is present in spirit. This duality highlights the importance of spiritual unity and support within the Christian community. The mention of their 'order' and 'firmness' reflects military imagery, suggesting discipline and resilience in their faith in Christ.|
|COL 2:6|Therefore, as you have received Christ Jesus the Lord, so walk in Him.|This verse emphasizes the continuation of faith in Christ and the importance of living according to His example. The phrase 'in Him' highlights the believer's relationship and dependence on Christ as they navigate their lives.|
|COL 2:7|rooted and built up in Him, and established in the faith as you were taught, abounding in it with thanksgiving.|The verse emphasizes the importance of being firmly established in faith, like a tree with deep roots, and the process of spiritual growth akin to construction, implying both stability and gratitude in one's walk with Christ.|
|COL 2:8|Beware that no one takes you captive through philosophy and empty deception, according to human tradition, according to the elemental spirits of the world, and not according to Christ.|The verse warns against being taken captive by worldly philosophies and empty deceit that deviate from Christ's teachings. The term 'philosophy' suggests an appeal to human wisdom that lacks substance, while 'the elements of the world' implies basic principles or teachings that are contrary to the truths found in Christ.|
|COL 2:9|For in Him dwells all the fullness of the Godhead bodily.|This translation emphasizes the reality of Christ's embodiment of the fullness of God, highlighting both the physical and spiritual aspects of His divine nature. The phrase 'all the fullness' is interpreted to reflect the complete and total nature of God found in Christ, aligning with the theological context of Colossians.|
|COL 2:10|And you are complete in Him, who is the head of all principality and power.|The verse emphasizes the completeness and fullness that believers have in Christ, indicating His authority over all spiritual beings and powers. The word 'fullness' suggests not just sufficiency but abundance in the context of spiritual life and authority.|
|COL 2:11|In Him you were also circumcised with a circumcision made without hands, by putting off the body of the sins of the flesh, in the circumcision of Christ.|This translation emphasizes the spiritual significance of circumcision as it relates to the believer's transformation in Christ. The term 'uncircumcision made without hands' highlights the divine work of God, rather than any physical act. The phrase 'putting off the body of sins of the flesh' signifies a profound inner change resulting from the work of Christ.|
|COL 2:12|having been buried with Him in baptism, in which you also were raised with Him through faith in the working of God, who raised Him from the dead.|This verse emphasizes the theological significance of baptism in the Christian faith, portraying it as an act of union with Christ's death and resurrection. The phrase 'buried with Him' connects to the imagery of death, while 'raised with Him' points to the new life that believers receive through faith in God's power. The structure of the sentence mirrors that of earlier scriptures that connect baptism to salvation and transformation.|
|COL 2:13|And you, being dead in your trespasses and in the uncircumcision of your flesh, He has made alive together with Him, forgiving us all our transgressions.|This verse highlights the transformation from spiritual death to life through Christ, emphasizing God's grace and the forgiveness of sins. The terms 'dead' and 'trespasses' are key, reflecting the severity of sin and the need for divine intervention.|
|COL 2:14|He has erased the record of our debts, the accusations that stood against us, and has taken it out of the way by nailing it to the cross.|In this translation, emphasis is placed on the removal of the written charges against us, signifying a decisive act of forgiveness through the crucifixion of Christ. The term 'handwriting' metaphorically refers to the record of our sins, which was a legal document that condemned us. The imagery of nailing it to the cross highlights the completeness of our redemption.|
|COL 2:15|Having disarmed the rulers and authorities, He made a public spectacle of them, triumphing over them by the cross.|In this verse, Paul emphasizes the triumph of Christ over spiritual powers and authorities, portraying His victory as a public display. The phrase 'having stripped off' suggests a complete removal of power, and 'triumphing over them' captures the essence of a victorious parade, demonstrating that these forces are defeated and powerless against the believer.|
|COL 2:16|Therefore, let no one judge you regarding what you eat or drink, or concerning a festival, a new moon, or sabbaths.|This verse emphasizes the importance of spiritual freedom in Christ, warning against being judged based on external rituals and practices that were part of the old covenant. The terms related to eating, drinking, and observing festivals point to the practices that were often misused as measures of righteousness.|
|COL 2:17|These are a shadow of the things that were to come; but the substance belongs to Christ.|This translation reflects the understanding that the 'shadow' signifies the foreshadowing of Christ's fulfillment in the New Covenant. The phrase 'the body of Christ' indicates the reality and substance found in Him as opposed to the mere observance of ceremonial laws.|
|COL 2:18|Let no one disqualify you, insisting on asceticism and worship of angels, going on in detail about visions, puffed up without reason by his sensuous mind.|This translation focuses on the warning against false humility and the dangers of engaging in superstitious or ungrounded spiritual practices. The phrase 'that no one disqualify you' is translated to capture the essence of being judged or led astray by others in a spiritual sense. The term 'angelic worship' is translated as 'worship of angels' to clarify the intention behind such practices without implying a definitive theological position beyond what is indicated in the text.|
|COL 2:19|and not holding fast to the Head, from whom the whole body, nourished and knit together through its joints and ligaments, grows with a growth that is from God.|In this verse, the imagery of the body refers to the church as the collective body of believers, with Christ as the head. The term 'holding fast to the head' emphasizes the importance of remaining connected to Christ, from whom all growth and sustenance come through the Spirit. The use of 'ligaments' and 'connections' illustrates the communal nature of the church, where each part supports and nurtures one another under the guidance of Christ.|
|COL 2:20|If you have died with Christ to the elemental spirits of the world, why, as if you were still alive in the world, do you submit to regulations?|In this verse, the Apostle Paul emphasizes the believer's death with Christ to worldly principles and teachings. The phrasing suggests that since believers have died to the basic principles or elements of this world, they should not still live according to them. The word 'dogmatizesthe' can carry a connotation of being subjected to rules or regulations, highlighting the conflict between freedom in Christ and the legalism of the world.|
|COL 2:21|"Do not touch, do not taste, do not handle"|The phrase in the original Greek, μὴ ἅψῃ μηδὲ γεύσῃ μηδὲ θίγῃς, translates to a prohibition against engaging with certain substances or practices that may be seen as forbidden. The context here focuses on ascetic practices that claim to lead to holiness or righteousness, which Paul critiques as unnecessary for those who are in Christ. This translation emphasizes the authoritative voice of the Apostle in guiding believers away from legalism.|
|COL 2:22|These regulations are destined to perish with use, because they are based on human commands and teachings.|In this verse, the emphasis is on the temporary nature of human rules and regulations regarding spiritual practices. The term 'decay' reflects the idea that such commands, when placed above true faith, lead to spiritual decline rather than growth.|
|COL 2:23|These have indeed an appearance of wisdom in self-made religion and humility, and severity to the body, but they are of no value in stopping the indulgence of the flesh.|The verse addresses the deceptive nature of ascetic practices and false humility that may seem wise or beneficial, yet ultimately serve human desires rather than glorifying God. The translation seeks to convey the importance of discernment in the face of religious observances that do not lead to true spiritual growth.|
