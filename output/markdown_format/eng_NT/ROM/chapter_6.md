| Reference | Verse | Translation Notes |
|:---------:|-------|-------------------|
|ROM 6:1|What shall we say then? Shall we continue in sin so that grace may abound?|This verse addresses a critical question regarding the relationship between sin and grace. The rhetorical question emphasizes a common misunderstanding about grace, prompting a deeper examination of what it means to live under grace rather than law.|
|ROM 6:2|Absolutely not! How can we who have died to sin still live in it?|This verse emphasizes the believer's identification with Christ's death in relation to sin, using strong language to reject the idea of living in sin after having died to it. The phrase 'May it never be!' is a strong expression of denial, reflecting a moral and spiritual awakening.|
|ROM 6:3|Or do you not know that as many of us as were baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into His death?|This verse emphasizes the connection between baptism and identification with Christ, particularly in His death. The term 'baptized into Christ' indicates a spiritual union that transcends mere physical immersion in water, symbolizing a complete transformation and a new identity in Christ, especially concerning His redemptive work.|
|ROM 6:4|Therefore, we were buried with Him through baptism into death, so that, just as Christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the Father, we too might walk in newness of life.|This translation emphasizes the union with Christ through baptism, connecting the believer's experience of dying to sin and being raised to a new life, reflecting the resurrection of Jesus. The term 'newness of life' indicates a transformed existence that follows the act of baptism, underscoring the believer's new identity in Christ.|
|ROM 6:5|For if we have been united with Him in the likeness of His death, we will certainly also be united with Him in the likeness of His resurrection.|This translation aims to capture the essence of being united with Christ in both His death and resurrection, emphasizing the transformative aspect of this union.|
|ROM 6:6|Knowing this, that our old self was crucified with Him, in order that the body of sin might be made powerless, so that we would no longer be enslaved to sin.|This verse emphasizes the transformation that occurs in the life of a believer through their identification with Christ's death. The term 'old self' or 'old man' refers to the sinful nature that is put to death through Christ’s crucifixion, leading to the cessation of bondage to sin. The phrase 'body of sin' signifies the physical manifestation of sinful desires that is rendered ineffective by Christ’s work.|
|ROM 6:7|For the one who has died has been justified from sin.|In this translation, the emphasis is placed on the concept of being justified or declared righteous after death, specifically in the context of sin. The phrase 'the one who has died' implies a complete break from sin's hold, resonating with the broader theological context of death and resurrection found in Pauline literature.|
|ROM 6:8|Now if we have died with Christ, we believe that we will also live with Him.|This verse emphasizes the belief in resurrection with Christ following death with Him. It draws on the themes of unity with Christ in both His death and resurrection, showcasing the hope and assurance of eternal life through Him. The translation retains a balance between readability and faithfulness to the original Greek text.|
|ROM 6:9|Knowing that Christ, having been raised from the dead, dies no more; death no longer has dominion over Him.|This verse emphasizes the finality of Christ's victory over death. The Greek word for 'death' (θάνατος) conveys a sense of not just the physical end, but the separation from God, which Christ overcame. The verb 'ἐγερθεὶς' denotes not only resurrection but also a new state of existence that is permanent, further underscoring that Christ will not die again. The structure of the sentence aligns with the idea of permanence and authority, stating that death no longer has dominion over Christ, which also implies a promise for believers who are united with Him in death and resurrection.|
|ROM 6:10|For in that He died, He died once for sin; but in that He lives, He lives to God.|In this verse, Paul emphasizes the significance of Christ's death in relation to sin, denoting that His death is a one-time, definitive act. The term 'died to sin' indicates a complete severance from sin's authority, while 'lives to God' illustrates a new, transformed life that is directed towards God.|
|ROM 6:11|Likewise, you also consider yourselves to be dead indeed to sin, but alive to God through Jesus Christ our Lord.|This verse emphasizes the dual reality of the believer's status: dead to sin and alive to God. The term 'logizesthe' suggests a reckoning or accounting, indicating that this identity must be embraced mentally and spiritually. The contrast between being dead to sin and living to God through Christ is fundamental to Christian doctrine regarding salvation and sanctification.|
|ROM 6:12|Therefore, do not let sin reign in your mortal body, that you should obey its desires.|This verse warns against allowing sin to dominate our mortal bodies, emphasizing the need to resist sinful desires that lead to disobedience. The translation preserves the imperative nature of the original Greek, urging believers to take an active stance against sin's influence.|
|ROM 6:13|And do not present your members as instruments of unrighteousness to sin, but present yourselves to God as those alive from the dead, and your members as instruments of righteousness to God.|In this verse, Paul contrasts the act of presenting our bodies as instruments of sin versus presenting them to God for righteous purposes. The terms used here focus on the nature of one's dedication and service, drawing a clear distinction between yielding to sin and offering oneself to God.|
|ROM 6:14|For sin will not have dominion over you, for you are not under the law but under grace.|This verse emphasizes the transformative power of grace in the believer's life, highlighting the change in authority from sin to grace. The use of 'under the law' contrasts the Old Covenant with the New Covenant of grace, illustrating the believer's freedom from the dominion of sin.|
|ROM 6:15|What then? Shall we sin because we are not under the law but under grace? May it never be!|In this verse, Paul poses a rhetorical question to emphasize the misunderstanding of grace. He is addressing the idea that being under grace might lead to sinful behavior, firmly rejecting this notion. The phrase 'God forbid' ('μὴ γένοιτο') is a strong expression of disapproval in Greek, which I translated as 'May it never be!' to convey the intensity of his response.|
|ROM 6:16|Do you not know that to whom you present yourselves as obedient servants, you are slaves? Whether to sin, which leads to death, or to obedience, which leads to righteousness, you are slaves to whichever you obey.|In this verse, the concept of servitude is central, emphasizing the choice between servitude to sin or righteousness. The phrase 'present yourselves as slaves' captures the notion of willingly yielding oneself to a master, reflecting both personal agency and the weight of consequences in moral decisions.|
|ROM 6:17|But thanks be to God that though you were slaves to sin, you have wholeheartedly obeyed the form of teaching to which you were entrusted.|This verse reflects the transformative grace of God that leads believers away from their former slavery to sin and into a new obedience characterized by the teaching of Christ. The term 'heart' emphasizes that obedience is not merely external compliance but stems from an internal commitment.|
|ROM 6:18|And having been set free from sin, you became servants of righteousness.|The translation captures the transition from the state of sinfulness to one of servitude to righteousness, emphasizing the change in allegiance that occurs when one is liberated from sin.|
|ROM 6:19|I speak in human terms because of your natural weakness. Just as you once presented your members as slaves to impurity and to lawlessness, leading to more lawlessness, so now present your members as slaves to righteousness, resulting in sanctification.|In this verse, the apostle Paul draws a contrast between the former life of sin and the new life of righteousness. He acknowledges the weakness of the flesh (the body) and emphasizes the need to present our bodies as instruments of righteousness rather than unrighteousness. The use of 'servants' indicates a choice of allegiance, highlighting the active role believers take in their spiritual journey.|
|ROM 6:20|For when you were slaves to sin, you were free in regard to righteousness.|In this verse, the contrast is made between the life of sin, which brings about spiritual bondage, and the life of righteousness, which leads to true freedom and sanctification. The original text uses the terms for slavery to emphasize the contrast between being bound to sin and being liberated by righteousness.|
|ROM 6:21|So what fruit did you have then in those things of which you are now ashamed? For the end of those things is death.|This verse reflects on the outcome of actions taken prior to salvation, contrasting the fruits of sin with the shame they bring now that one is in Christ. The term 'fruit' here denotes the results or consequences of past behavior, emphasizing a change in life direction.|
|ROM 6:22|But now, having been set free from sin and having become servants of God, you have your fruit leading to holiness, and the outcome is eternal life.|This verse highlights the transformation from being slaves to sin to becoming servants of God, leading to a life of holiness and the promise of eternal life. The terms 'fruit' and 'sanctification' indicate a life that bears good results as a response to God's grace.|
|ROM 6:23|For the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.|This verse contrasts the grim outcome of sin with the gracious gift of God. The term 'opsōnia' is specifically linked to the 'wages' or the earned consequence of sin, implying a payment due for wrongdoing. In stark contrast, 'the gift of God' underscores the unearned and gracious nature of eternal life offered through Jesus Christ, highlighting the difference between human efforts and divine grace.|
