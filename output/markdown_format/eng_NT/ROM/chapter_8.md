| Reference | Verse | Translation Notes |
|:---------:|-------|-------------------|
|ROM 8:1|Therefore, there is now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus, who do not walk according to the flesh, but according to the Spirit.|This translation emphasizes the state of believers in Christ as free from condemnation and highlights the distinction between walking according to the flesh versus the Spirit, drawing from the theological themes prevalent in the Book of Romans.|
|ROM 8:2|For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has set me free from the law of sin and death.|In this translation, emphasis is placed on the liberating power of the Spirit of life as it pertains to the believer's relationship with sin and death. The structure reflects the contrast between the law of the Spirit and the law of sin and death.|
|ROM 8:3|For what the Law could not accomplish, being weak through the flesh, God sent His own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh and for sin, He condemned sin in the flesh.|This verse highlights God's initiative in addressing the limitations of the Law, which could not overcome sin due to human weakness. It emphasizes the sending of His Son, Jesus, who takes on human likeness to confront sin and offer redemption.|
|ROM 8:4|So that the righteous requirement of the Law might be fulfilled in us, who do not walk according to the flesh but according to the Spirit.|This verse emphasizes the fulfillment of the Law's requirement through the work of the Spirit in believers, contrasting the life lived according to the flesh with the life empowered by the Spirit.|
|ROM 8:5|For those who are according to the flesh set their minds on the things of the flesh, but those who are according to the Spirit set their minds on the things of the Spirit.|In this verse, the contrast between those who live according to the flesh and those who live according to the Spirit is emphasized. The term 'flesh' signifies the sinful human nature and earthly desires, while 'Spirit' refers to the divine guidance and the new life believers have in Christ. The wording is chosen to reflect a clear distinction in mindset and the implications of that mindset in one's life.|
|ROM 8:6|For to set the mind on the flesh is death, but to set the mind on the Spirit is life and peace; for the mind set on the flesh is hostile toward God.|This verse emphasizes the stark contrast between the mindset that focuses on earthly desires (the flesh) and the mindset that seeks spiritual truths and life through the Holy Spirit. The terms 'death' and 'life' are pivotal in illustrating the consequences of each mindset, underscoring the enmity of the flesh towards God.|
|ROM 8:7|For the mindset governed by the flesh is in rebellion against God; it does not submit to the law of God, nor can it do so.|The term 'the law of God' refers to God's divine standard which the flesh cannot submit to, illustrating the inherent conflict between the sinful nature and God's will.|
|ROM 8:8|So those who are in the flesh cannot please God.|This verse reflects the theological assertion that those who are in a state of living according to the flesh cannot please God. The term 'in the flesh' denotes a life dominated by sinful desires, in contrast to a life led by the Spirit, which aligns with God's will.|
|ROM 8:9|But you are not in the flesh; you are in the Spirit, if indeed the Spirit of God dwells in you. If anyone does not have the Spirit of Christ, he does not belong to Him.|This verse emphasizes the indwelling of the Spirit of God and its significance in defining one's relationship with Christ. The phrase 'in the flesh' denotes a state of living devoid of spiritual influence, contrasting sharply with living 'in the Spirit.' This sets up a dichotomy essential for understanding the nature of true believers.|
|ROM 8:10|But if Christ is in you, although the body is dead because of sin, the Spirit is life because of righteousness.|This verse contrasts the physical body, which is subject to death due to sin, with the spirit, which is alive through the righteousness that comes from Christ. The terms 'body' and 'spirit' are emphasized to illustrate the dual nature of existence for those in Christ.|
|ROM 8:11|And if the Spirit of Him who raised Jesus from the dead dwells in you, then He who raised Christ from the dead will also give life to your mortal bodies through His Spirit that dwells in you.|In this translation, the focus is on the resurrection power of the Spirit dwelling in believers, emphasizing the transformative aspect of the Spirit in their lives. The phrase 'making alive' highlights the life-giving function of the Holy Spirit, similar to how the Spirit raised Jesus from the dead.|
|ROM 8:12|Therefore, brothers, we are debtors—not to the flesh, to live according to the flesh.|In this verse, the Apostle Paul addresses believers, emphasizing that their identity and responsibilities are not tied to living according to the flesh (i.e., the sinful nature). The term 'brothers' signifies a familial bond among believers, and 'debtors' implies a moral obligation to live in accordance with the Spirit, rather than yielding to the desires of the flesh.|
|ROM 8:13|For if you live according to the flesh, you are destined to die; but if by the Spirit you put to death the deeds of the body, you will live.|In this verse, the emphasis is on the necessity of living by the Spirit rather than succumbing to the desires of the flesh. The contrasting terms of 'flesh' and 'Spirit' highlight the choice that believers must make in their spiritual journey.|
|ROM 8:14|For those who are led by the Spirit of God are the sons of God.|In this translation, the phrase 'led by the Spirit' emphasizes the active role of the Holy Spirit in guiding believers, while 'children of God' reflects the familial relationship that believers have with God as their Father.|
|ROM 8:15|For you did not receive a spirit of slavery that leads back into fear, but you received the Spirit of adoption, by whom we cry out, 'Abba, Father.'|This translation emphasizes the contrast between the spirit of slavery and the spirit of adoption, reflecting the intimate relationship believers have with God as their Father. The term 'Abba' retains its original Aramaic meaning, expressing deep affection and trust.|
|ROM 8:16|The Spirit Himself bears witness with our spirit that we are children of God.|The phrase 'the Spirit' refers specifically to the Holy Spirit, emphasizing His active role in affirming our identity as God's children. The use of 'testifies' captures the idea of an internal confirmation and assurance that one is indeed a child of God, connecting to the context of assurance and relationship with God presented in this chapter.|
|ROM 8:17|And if we are children, then we are heirs—heirs of God and fellow heirs with Christ, provided we suffer with him in order that we may also be glorified with him.|In this verse, the Apostle Paul highlights the dual inheritance that believers possess as children of God. The phrase 'joint heirs with Christ' indicates a close relationship and shared destiny between Christ and His followers. The use of 'suffering' implies that partaking in Christ's glory also involves sharing in His sufferings, which aligns with the broader theme of perseverance in the Christian faith.|
|ROM 8:18|For I consider that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory that is to be revealed to us.|In this translation, I aim to capture the contrast between present suffering and future glory. The word 'account' reflects the reasoning or consideration expressed in the Greek term 'λογίζομαι,' while 'worthy' and 'revealed' relate closely to the concepts of worthiness and the unveiling of glory in the coming age.|
|ROM 8:19|For the earnest expectation of creation eagerly waits for the revealing of the sons of God.|The term 'creation' refers to all of nature, which, in a state of anticipation, longs for the revelation of God's children. This reflects the hope that creation will be restored and fully manifested at the coming of Christ.|
|ROM 8:20|For the creation was subjected to futility, not willingly, but because of Him who subjected it, in hope.|This verse expresses the idea that creation is subjected to futility or vanity not by its own choice, but by God's sovereign will due to humanity's sin. The word 'maiority' in this context indicates a lack of purpose or usefulness, which resonates with themes found throughout Scripture regarding the effects of sin on creation.|
|ROM 8:21|that the creation itself will be set free from its bondage to decay and obtain the glorious freedom of the children of God.|This verse emphasizes the liberation of creation from corruption and decay into the glorious freedom that awaits the children of God. The terms 'freedom' and 'glory' are key in both the context of creation and the believers' future.|
|ROM 8:22|For we know that the whole creation has been groaning together in the pains of childbirth until now.|The verse conveys a deep sense of collective suffering and yearning experienced by creation as it awaits redemption. The term 'krijsos' is rendered here as 'creation,' encompassing all that God has made. The phrase 'groans and labors' is indicative of intense longing and struggle, commonly associated with childbirth, emphasizing the hope intertwined with suffering.|
|ROM 8:23|And not only the creation, but we ourselves, who have the firstfruits of the Spirit, also groan inwardly as we eagerly await our adoption as sons, the redemption of our bodies.|In this verse, Paul contrasts the present sufferings and the anticipation of future redemption, emphasizing the dual experience of believers who possess the Spirit and yearn for the full realization of their adoption as children of God. The terms 'firstfruits', 'groaning', and 'redemption' highlight both the current experience and future hope inherent in the Christian faith.|
|ROM 8:24|For in hope we were saved; but hope that is seen is not hope at all. For who hopes for what they already see?|This verse emphasizes the distinction between hope and what is already seen. In this context, hope is portrayed as a forward-looking expectation rather than a current reality. It also connects to the larger theme of salvation and redemption that Paul is discussing in this chapter.|
|ROM 8:25|But if we hope for what we do not see, we eagerly wait for it with perseverance.|This verse emphasizes the contrast between what we can see and what we hope for. It highlights the importance of patience and anticipation in the life of a believer, particularly in relation to the unseen future promises of God.|
|ROM 8:26|In the same way, the Spirit helps us in our weaknesses; for we do not know what we ought to pray for, but the Spirit Himself intercedes for us with groanings too deep for words.|This verse highlights the role of the Holy Spirit in assisting believers during prayer, especially when they feel weak or uncertain. The terms 'groanings' and 'infirmities' illustrate the depth of human struggle and the Spirit's compassionate intercession. This translation aims to convey the profound connection between believers and the Holy Spirit in their prayer life.|
|ROM 8:27|And He who searches the hearts knows what is the mind of the Spirit, because the Spirit intercedes for the saints according to God.|The phrase 'the one who searches hearts' refers to God, who understands the innermost thoughts and intentions of people. 'The mind of the Spirit' indicates the divine understanding that the Spirit has, aligning perfectly with God's will. This verse emphasizes the Spirit’s role in intercession on behalf of believers, especially when they are unable to articulate their needs in prayer.|
|ROM 8:28|And we know that in all things God works together for the good of those who love Him, who have been called according to His purpose.|This translation emphasizes God's sovereignty and the ultimate good that emerges from His orchestration of events in the lives of those who love Him. The phrase 'all things' encompasses both trials and blessings, while 'good' is understood in the context of God's divine purpose.|
|ROM 8:29|For those whom He foreknew, He also predestined to be conformed to the image of His Son, that He might be the firstborn among many brothers.|This verse emphasizes the divine foreknowledge and predestination of believers to become like Christ. The concept of being conformed to the image of Christ reflects a transformation that is not just spiritual but also moral and ethical, aligning believers with the character of the Son.|
|ROM 8:30|And those whom He predestined, He also called; and those whom He called, He also justified; and those whom He justified, He also glorified.|This verse highlights the sequential acts of God's divine plan: foreknowledge, calling, justification, and glorification. Each step builds upon the previous one, emphasizing the assurance of salvation and the transformative journey of believers in Christ.|
|ROM 8:31|What then shall we say to these things? If God is for us, who can be against us?|This verse emphasizes the assurance and confidence believers have in God's support. The rhetorical question highlights that if God is on our side, no adversary can stand against us. The phrasing is meant to evoke a sense of security and victory through divine favor.|
|ROM 8:32|He who did not spare His own Son, but gave Him up for us all, how will He not also with Him graciously give us all things?|In this verse, the emphasis is on the incredible generosity of God in giving His Son for our benefit, and the rhetorical question at the end highlights the assurance that, if He did the greatest thing for us, how much more will He give us everything we need? The phrase 'how will he not also graciously give us all things' is meant to instill confidence in God's continued provision.|
|ROM 8:33|Who can bring a charge against God's chosen ones? It is God who justifies.|This verse emphasizes God's justifying nature and the security of those whom He has chosen. The question format underscores the assurance that, with God's righteousness in place, no accusation against His elect can stand.|
|ROM 8:34|Who is the one that condemns? It is Christ who died, and more than that, who was raised to life, who is at the right hand of God and who intercedes for us.|In this verse, the rhetorical question underscores the assurance of Christ's sacrificial death and resurrection. The term 'who' (τίς) introduces the question of accusation, while 'Christ' and 'the one who died' highlight His pivotal role. The phrase 'at the right hand of God' indicates His authority and position of intercession for believers, emphasizing both His divinity and His continual advocacy on our behalf.|
|ROM 8:35|Who will separate us from the love of Christ? Will trouble, distress, persecution, famine, nakedness, danger, or sword?|This verse emphasizes the unbreakable bond between believers and the love of Christ, highlighting various forms of adversity that cannot separate us from His love. The question posed at the beginning indicates a challenge that is answered by the assurance of Christ’s enduring love amidst trials.|
|ROM 8:36|As it is written, "For Your sake we are being killed all day long; We are regarded as sheep destined for slaughter."|In this verse, Paul reflects on the reality of suffering endured by believers as a consequence of their faith in Christ. He references the sacrificial nature of this suffering, akin to sheep being led to slaughter, which captures the essence of both vulnerability and purpose in enduring hardships for the sake of the Gospel.|
|ROM 8:37|Yet, in all these things, we overwhelmingly conquer through Him who loved us.|The phrase 'we are more than conquerors' emphasizes an overwhelming victory, underscoring not just survival or endurance, but triumph through the love of Christ. The term used here implies that our victories in life are not due to our own strength but are enabled by God's love for us.|
|ROM 8:38|For I am convinced that neither death nor life, neither angels nor rulers, neither present things nor future things, will be able to separate us from the love of God that is in Christ Jesus our Lord.|This translation emphasizes the certainty of the believer's security in Christ, utilizing the words for death and life, as well as spiritual authorities, to convey the unbreakable bond with God. The terms used reflect both earthly and spiritual realms, reinforcing the depth of God's love and the assurance of our relationship with Him.|
|ROM 8:39|nor height nor depth, nor any other created thing, will be able to separate us from the love of God that is in Christ Jesus our Lord.|The terms 'height' and 'depth' are metaphorical representations of extremes, emphasizing that no possible circumstance in creation can intervene between believers and God's love.
