| Reference | Verse | Translation Notes |
|:---------:|-------|-------------------|
|ROM 10:1|Brothers, my heart's desire and prayer to God for the Israelites is that they may be saved.|In this verse, Paul expresses his heartfelt desire and prayer for the salvation of Israel, emphasizing both his deep emotional connection to his people and the importance of prayer in seeking God's intervention for their salvation. The use of 'heart' reflects personal passion, while 'prayer' underscores the spiritual action taken on behalf of others.|
|ROM 10:2|For I bear them witness that they have a zeal for God, but not according to knowledge.|This verse highlights the intensity of the Israelites' zeal for God, yet points out that their understanding is lacking. The emphasis on 'knowledge' contrasts their fervent passion with the need for proper understanding of God’s righteousness.|
|ROM 10:3|For being ignorant of the righteousness of God and seeking to establish their own, they did not submit to the righteousness of God.|This verse discusses the concept of seeking one's own righteousness versus the righteousness that comes from God. The focus is on the misunderstanding of God’s way of justification and the pride in one's self-reliance, reflecting a common theme in Pauline theology that emphasizes grace over human effort.|
|ROM 10:4|For Christ is the fulfillment of the Law for righteousness to everyone who believes.|In this verse, the term 'end' (τέλος) refers to the fulfillment or completion of the Law, indicating that Christ is the culmination of the Law's purpose. The phrase 'to everyone who believes' (παντὶ τῷ πιστεύοντι) highlights the accessibility of righteousness through faith, underscoring the belief-centered nature of the Christian faith compared to the works-based righteousness sought by some.|
|ROM 10:5|For Moses writes about the righteousness that comes from the Law, saying, 'The person who does these things will live by them.'|This verse highlights the principle that adherence to the law is essential for righteousness. Paul cites Moses to emphasize that the law is not merely a set of rules, but a pathway to life for those who fulfill its requirements. The Greek phrase 'ὁ ποιήσας' emphasizes action, stressing that living according to the law is paramount.|
|ROM 10:6|But the righteousness that is based on faith says this: 'Do not say in your heart, “Who will ascend into heaven?”'—that is, to bring Christ down.|This translation aims to preserve the rhetorical style of Paul's argument while ensuring clarity. The phrase 'do not say in your heart' reflects a personal internal dialogue, emphasizing the futility of seeking righteousness through human effort rather than through faith in Christ.|
|ROM 10:7|Or who will descend into the abyss? That is, to bring Christ up from the dead.|This verse emphasizes the futility of trying to summon Christ from the depths, stressing that salvation through faith does not require extraordinary measures. It reflects the accessibility of faith rather than the need for impossible quests.|
|ROM 10:8|But what does it say? The word is very near you, in your mouth and in your heart; that is, the message of faith which we proclaim.|This verse emphasizes the nearness of God's word, highlighting both the spoken aspect (mouth) and the inner conviction (heart) associated with faith. It is a profound declaration of how the message of salvation is accessible and integral to the believer's life.|
|ROM 10:9|That if you declare with your mouth, 'Jesus is Lord,' and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved.|In this translation, the phrases 'confess' and 'believe' are emphasized as key components of the Christian faith. The structure is kept close to the original Greek while ensuring clarity and coherence in English.|
|ROM 10:10|For with the heart one believes, resulting in righteousness, and with the mouth confession is made, leading to salvation.|This translation focuses on the relationship between belief in the heart and confession with the mouth. The phrase emphasizes the internal conviction of faith leading to outward expression, essential for understanding salvation.|
|ROM 10:11|For the Scripture says, 'Everyone who puts their trust in Him will never be put to shame.'|This verse emphasizes the assurance of faith and trust in Christ. The phrase ‘will not be put to shame’ reflects a common biblical theme of trust in God that assures believers of their salvation and acceptance in Him. The translation maintains the essence of the original text while presenting it in a contemporary and accessible manner.|
|ROM 10:12|For there is no distinction between Jew and Gentile; for the same Lord is Lord of all and richly blesses all who call on Him.|This verse emphasizes the equality of all people before God and highlights the inclusive nature of salvation through Jesus Christ. The term 'Lord' refers to Jesus, affirming His lordship over all humanity. 'Riches' signifies the abundant grace and mercy available to everyone who calls upon Him, which reflects God's character as generous and welcoming.|
|ROM 10:13|For everyone who calls upon the name of the Lord will be saved.|The phrase 'calls on the name of the Lord' is central to this verse, emphasizing the action of invoking God's name for salvation. The word 'saved' translates the Greek term 'σωθήσεται', indicating a future passive meaning that salvation is received by the one calling. This verse captures the universality of salvation through faith in God.|
|ROM 10:14|But how will they call on Him in whom they have not believed? And how will they believe in Him of whom they have never heard? And how will they hear without someone preaching?|This verse emphasizes the necessity of faith and hearing the message of Christ for salvation. The questions highlight the sequential steps leading to belief: calling on the Lord requires prior faith, faith requires having heard the message, and hearing requires a preacher to proclaim it.|
|ROM 10:15|And how will they preach unless they are sent? As it is written: "How beautiful are the feet of those who bring good news of peace, who proclaim good things!"|The Greek term 'κηρύξουσιν' is understood as 'to preach' or 'to proclaim,' emphasizing the act of delivering the message of the Gospel. The phrase 'ὡς ὡραῖοι οἱ πόδες' translates literally as 'how beautiful are the feet,' conveying the idea that those who bring good news are worthy of honor and respect. This verse also draws from Old Testament imagery of proclaimers of peace, emphasizing the significance of the message being shared.|
|ROM 10:16|But not all have heeded the good news; for Isaiah says, 'Lord, who has believed our message?'|This verse emphasizes the lack of response to the Gospel, highlighting a recurring theme in Scripture where many hear the truth yet do not believe it. The use of 'obey' reflects a deeper understanding of belief as an action, aligning with the idea that faith requires a response.|
|ROM 10:17|So faith comes from hearing, and hearing through the word of God.|This verse emphasizes the importance of hearing the word of God as a foundation for faith. The term 'hearing' refers not only to the physical act but to receiving and understanding the message of God. The Greek word for 'word' here (ῥῆμα) denotes a specific utterance or saying from God, reinforcing the idea that faith is built upon divine revelation and truth.|
|ROM 10:18|But I ask, did they not hear? Indeed, their voice has gone out to all the earth, and their words to the ends of the world.|This verse emphasizes the universal reach of God's message, echoing the idea presented in previous verses about hearing and faith. The Greek term 'φθόγγος' (voice) indicates a spoken message, while 'ῥήματα' (words) underscores the content of that message, suggesting the importance of both in the proclamation of faith.|
|ROM 10:19|But I say, did Israel not understand? First, Moses says: 'I will make you envious by what is not a nation; by a foolish nation I will anger you.'|In this verse, Paul references the jealousy God has towards Israel in light of their unfaithfulness. The language reflects God's desire for His people and His willingness to provoke them through others who do not belong to Him, emphasizing both His justice and the mystery of His plan for salvation.|
|ROM 10:20|And Isaiah boldly declares, 'I was found by those who did not seek me; I became manifest to those who did not ask for me.'|This verse emphasizes God's revelation to those who were not actively seeking Him, highlighting His mercy and the contrast between divine grace and human expectation. Isaiah's words reflect a broader theme of God reaching out to the marginalized and those considered outsiders.|
|ROM 10:21|But regarding Israel, He says: 'All day long I have stretched out My hands to a disobedient and contrary people.'|In this verse, the apostle Paul is quoting from the Old Testament to emphasize God's persistent outreach to Israel despite their rebellion. The imagery of God's hands being outstretched symbolizes His invitation and willingness to embrace, while the description of the people as 'rebellious' highlights their refusal to respond.|
