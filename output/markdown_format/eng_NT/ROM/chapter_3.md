| Reference | Verse | Translation Notes |
|:---------:|-------|-------------------|
|ROM 3:1|What then is the advantage of the Jew, or what is the benefit of circumcision?|This verse raises the question of the advantages of being a Jew or the value of circumcision, emphasizing the deeper spiritual significance rather than merely the physical or ceremonial aspects.|
|ROM 3:2|Much in every way. To begin with, they were entrusted with the very words of God.|This translation emphasizes the faithfulness of the Jewish people to the divine revelations and underscores the significance of being entrusted with God's words.|
|ROM 3:3|What then, if some did not believe? Will their lack of faith nullify the faithfulness of God?|The verse addresses the concern that human unbelief might nullify God's faithfulness. The word 'unbelief' (ἀπιστία) is juxtaposed with 'faith' (πίστιν), illustrating a common biblical theme of God's constancy in light of human doubt.|
|ROM 3:4|Far from it! Let God be true, and every person a liar, as it is written: "So that you may be justified in your words and prevail when you are judged."|In this translation, the emphasis is placed on the contrasting nature of God's truth and human fallibility. The phrase 'let God be true' reflects God's absolute reliability, while 'every man a liar' illustrates the universality of human deceit. The verse encapsulates the idea that God's righteousness prevails despite human shortcomings.|
|ROM 3:5|But if our unrighteousness serves to highlight God's righteousness, what shall we say? Is God unjust to bring wrath upon us? (I speak in human terms.)|In this verse, Paul addresses the apparent contradiction of God's righteousness in light of human wrongdoing. The phrase 'God's justice' and 'human wrongdoing' are emphasized, bringing attention to the theological dilemma he is raising. The use of 'wrath' (ὀργή) and 'unrighteousness' (ἀδικία) signifies the serious nature of sin and the character of God in judgment.|
|ROM 3:6|Absolutely not! For how could God judge the world if that were the case?|This verse highlights a rhetorical question concerning God's judgment and justice, emphasizing the absurdity of thinking that God would be unjust in His actions. It captures the essence of divine justice, reinforcing the idea that God's character does not allow for injustice in His judgments.|
|ROM 3:7|For if the truth of God shines more brightly through my falsehood, resulting in His glory, why then am I still judged as a sinner?|This verse addresses the paradox of God's truth in relation to human sinfulness. Paul poses a rhetorical question that highlights the irony of sin leading to God’s glory, while still affirming that he does not escape judgment as a sinner. The use of 'truth' and 'lie' plays a crucial role in establishing a contrast between divine righteousness and human failure.|
|ROM 3:8|And why should we be slandered as saying, 'Let us do evil so that good may come'? Their condemnation is just.|In this verse, Paul is addressing accusations made against him and other Christians, emphasizing the absurdity of suggesting that doing evil could bring about good. This translation aims to preserve the rhetorical style and moral gravity of Paul's argument while making it clear that the judgment against those who claim this is just.|
|ROM 3:9|What then? Are we better than they? Not at all; for we have already charged that both Jews and Greeks are all under sin.|This verse addresses the universal nature of sin, asserting that both Jews and Greeks are under sin's power. The phrasing emphasizes that there is no inherent advantage in ethnicity when it comes to the state of sinfulness before God.|
|ROM 3:10|As it is written: "There is no one righteous, not even one."|The translation focuses on the universal condition of humanity in relation to righteousness. The Greek term 'δίκαιος' refers to a state of being right or just, while 'οὐδὲ εἷς' emphasizes the totality of the statement—no exceptions. This aligns with the broader context of sinfulness and the need for redemption that is prevalent in Pauline theology.|
|ROM 3:11|There is no one who understands; there is no one who seeks God.|This verse emphasizes the lack of understanding and the absence of a sincere pursuit of God among humanity. The phrasing reflects both the Old Testament references to human folly and the call to seek after the divine. The repetition of 'there is no one' mirrors the earlier assertion of universal unrighteousness, reinforcing the theme of human spiritual deficiency.|
|ROM 3:12|All have turned away; they have become worthless together; there is no one who does good, not even one.|This verse highlights the universal nature of human sinfulness, indicating that every person has strayed from righteousness and no one acts with goodness on their own. The words 'turned aside' and 'none' are consistent with similar biblical themes about the condition of humanity.|
|ROM 3:13|Their throat is an open grave; they deceive with their tongues; the venom of serpents is under their lips.|In this verse, Paul emphasizes the destructive nature of the words and speech of the wicked. The imagery of an open grave signifies death and deception, highlighting the corruption inherent in their speech. The references to poison and flattery suggest manipulation and malice, which align with the biblical understanding of the tongue as a source of evil.|
|ROM 3:14|Their mouths are filled with curses and bitterness.|The phrase captures the essence of deceit and bitterness associated with the words spoken by the wicked, mirroring the imagery used in preceding verses about the grave and poison.|
|ROM 3:15|Their feet are swift to spill innocent blood.|This translation emphasizes the violent imagery and the metaphorical nature of the feet 'shedding blood' to reflect moral corruption and actions that lead to harm.|
|ROM 3:16|Destruction and turmoil are in their paths.|In this verse, the original Greek term 'σύντριμμα' conveys the idea of 'destruction' or 'ruin,' while 'ταλαιπωρία' refers to 'trouble' or 'distress.' The overall context emphasizes the consequences of sinful paths and actions. This translation seeks to encapsulate the severity of these themes while staying faithful to the original text.|
|ROM 3:17|And they have not known the way of peace.|The phrase ‘way of peace’ refers to a state or path of harmony and tranquility, emphasizing the absence of such a way in the context of unrighteousness. This verse connects to the overarching theme of the absence of divine peace among those who do not follow God’s ways.|
|ROM 3:18|There is no fear of God before their eyes.|This verse emphasizes the absence of a genuine fear of God in those who are unrighteous. The concept of 'fear of God' in biblical terms often relates to reverence and awe towards God's holiness and authority. In contrast, the absence of such fear signifies a moral and spiritual decay.|
|ROM 3:19|Now we know that whatever the law says, it speaks to those who are under the law, so that every mouth may be silenced and the whole world may be accountable to God.|In this verse, Paul emphasizes the universal applicability of the law and its role in revealing human sinfulness before God. The phrase 'that every mouth may be stopped' indicates that all excuses and justifications for sin are rendered void when confronted with God's standard of righteousness. The term 'under sin' reflects the idea that all humanity stands guilty before God due to sin, irrespective of their awareness or knowledge of the law.|
|ROM 3:20|For by works of the law no flesh will be justified in His sight, for through the law comes the knowledge of sin.|In this translation, the phrase 'works of the law' has been emphasized to convey the central theme of justification being unattainable through human efforts under the law. The focus is also placed on the concept of sin knowledge through the law, emphasizing its role in revealing human sinfulness rather than providing justification.|
|ROM 3:21|But now, apart from the law, the righteousness of God has been made known, being witnessed by the Law and the Prophets.|This verse emphasizes that the righteousness of God is manifested apart from the law, confirming that the Old Testament law and the prophets testify to this righteousness. The phrasing 'now apart from the law' indicates a new revelation of God's righteousness that transcends the Mosaic law, establishing a faith-based relationship with God that the law foreshadowed.|
|ROM 3:22|The righteousness of God through faith in Jesus Christ is available to all and upon all who believe, for there is no distinction.|This verse emphasizes the universal nature of God's righteousness that is available through faith in Jesus Christ. The phrase 'for all and upon all who believe' signifies that there are no distinctions or barriers to receiving this righteousness.|
|ROM 3:23|For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God.|This translation emphasizes the universality of sin and its consequences, aligning with the theological context of humanity's need for redemption through Christ. The use of 'all' and 'fall short of the glory of God' reflects the gravity of the situation without losing the hope found in Christ's salvation.|
|ROM 3:24|being justified freely by His grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus.|In this verse, the emphasis is on justification being a free gift from God, obtained through His grace. The word 'redemption' (ἀπολυτρώσεως) highlights the act of being freed from sin and its consequences, accomplished through Christ. The use of 'grace' (χάριτι) suggests an unmerited favor, which is central to Christian theology regarding salvation.|
|ROM 3:25|Whom God set forth as an atoning sacrifice through faith in His blood, to demonstrate His righteousness, because of the forbearance shown toward the sins previously committed.|This verse emphasizes God's provision of atonement through faith in Christ's blood, showcasing His righteousness and patience in addressing past sins. The term 'ἱλαστήριον' refers to a means of atonement, highlighting the sacrificial aspect of Christ's sacrifice. The translation reflects the nuances of faith and righteousness.|
|ROM 3:26|in the forbearance of God, to demonstrate His righteousness at the present time, so that He might be just and the justifier of the one who has faith in Jesus.|In this verse, Paul emphasizes God's righteousness demonstrated in the present time, focusing on His justice and the justification of those who believe in Jesus Christ. The term 'forbearance' refers to God's patience with sin, which ultimately leads to the manifestation of His righteousness through faith.|
|ROM 3:27|Where then is boasting? It has been excluded. By what kind of law? Not the law of works, but the law of faith.|In this verse, the Apostle Paul is emphasizing that boasting or pride in one's own achievements is excluded by the principle of faith. He contrasts the law of works with the law of faith, indicating that it is through faith in Christ, not through human effort, that one attains righteousness. The choice of 'exclusion' for 'ἐξεκλείσθη' captures the definitive closing off of boasting before God.|
|ROM 3:28|Therefore, we conclude that a person is justified by faith apart from the works of the law.|In this translation, the emphasis is placed on the principle of justification by faith, separating it from the works of the law. The Greek word 'λογίζομαι' indicates a process of reasoning or accounting, which is reflected in the phrase 'we consider'. The term 'justified' refers to being declared righteous before God, while 'without the works of the law' clearly indicates that human efforts cannot attain righteousness.|
|ROM 3:29|Is God the God of Jews only? Is he not the God of Gentiles too? Yes, of Gentiles as well.|The phrase in this verse emphasizes the universality of God’s sovereignty over all nations, highlighting that His authority and offer of grace extend beyond just the Jewish people to all Gentiles. The original Greek strongly contrasts the exclusivity of the Jewish faith with the inclusive call of the Gospel.|
|ROM 3:30|Since there is only one God, who will justify both the circumcised by faith and the uncircumcised through faith.|This verse highlights the singularity of God and His authority to justify both Jews (circumcised) and Gentiles (uncircumcised) through faith. The emphasis on faith as the means of justification underscores the core theme of salvation being accessible to all, regardless of ethnic or cultural background.|
|ROM 3:31|Do we then nullify the law through faith? Certainly not! On the contrary, we uphold the law.|In this verse, Paul addresses a potential misunderstanding regarding the role of faith in relation to the law. The phrase 'we do not nullify the law' affirms the ongoing significance of God's law while emphasizing that faith, rather than adherence to the law alone, is what justifies believers before God.|
