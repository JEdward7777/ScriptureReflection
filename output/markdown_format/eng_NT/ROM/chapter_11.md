| Reference | Verse | Translation Notes |
|:---------:|-------|-------------------|
|ROM 11:1|I ask then, has God rejected His people? Certainly not! For I myself am an Israelite, a descendant of Abraham, from the tribe of Benjamin.|In this translation, the phrase 'God has not rejected His people' is crucial as it conveys the author's emphasis on God's continuing relationship with Israel, contrasting the idea of rejection. The word 'I' highlights Paul's personal identification with his people, which underscores the emotional weight of the statement.|
|ROM 11:2|God has not rejected His people whom He foreknew. Or do you not know what the Scripture says of Elijah, how he pleads with God against Israel?|In this translation, I aim to capture the essence of God's enduring commitment to His chosen people, paralleling the prophetic and covenantal themes present throughout Scripture. The phrase 'whom He foreknew' emphasizes God's sovereign choice and foreknowledge of Israel as His people.|
|ROM 11:3|Lord, they have killed Your prophets and torn down Your altars, and I alone am left, and they seek my life.|In this verse, Elijah expresses his feeling of isolation and despair after witnessing the persecution of the prophets and the destruction of God's altars. The use of the terms 'prophets,' 'kill,' 'altars,' and 'soul' closely reflects the severity of the situation he faced, emphasizing the faithfulness of a remnant amidst widespread apostasy.|
|ROM 11:4|But what does God say to him? "I have reserved for Myself seven thousand men who have not bowed the knee to Baal."|This verse responds to the lament of Elijah regarding his isolation in serving God amidst widespread idolatry. Paul references it to illustrate God's faithfulness to a remnant of believers. The term 'seven thousand' is significant as it underscores God's provision of a faithful group despite a larger trend of apostasy.|
|ROM 11:5|So too, at the present time there is a remnant chosen by grace.|In this verse, Paul highlights the concept of a remnant chosen by grace during his time, paralleling the biblical principle of God preserving a faithful group despite widespread unfaithfulness. The term 'remnant' and 'election of grace' are key to understanding the theological emphasis on divine selection and mercy.|
|ROM 11:6|But if it is by grace, then it is no longer based on works; otherwise grace would no longer be grace. And if it is based on works, it is no longer grace; otherwise the work is no longer a work.|This translation emphasizes the distinct nature of grace as it relates to works, highlighting that if grace were earned by works, it would lose its essence as grace. The structure of the original text underscores a contrast that is pivotal to understanding Paul’s theological argument regarding salvation and the relationship between faith and works.|
|ROM 11:7|What then? Israel failed to obtain what it was seeking, but the elect obtained it, and the rest were hardened.|This verse discusses the outcome of Israel's pursuit of righteousness and how only a remnant, chosen by God, attained it, while the rest were hardened. The choice and the concept of remnant are significant themes throughout Scripture, particularly in relation to God's sovereign selection.|
|ROM 11:8|As it is written: 'God has given them a spirit of stupor, eyes that do not see and ears that do not hear, to this very day.'|This verse references God's active role in the spiritual blindness of Israel, showing a continuity with the prophetic tradition in the Old Testament where similar themes of blindness and inability to perceive spiritual truth are present. The phrase 'spirit of deep sleep' suggests a divine action resulting in a profound lack of spiritual awareness, mirroring the themes found in the cited related verses.|
|ROM 11:9|And David says, 'Let their table become a snare, and a trap, and a stumbling block, and a recompense to them.'|In this verse, Paul cites David to emphasize the consequences of rejection that Israel faces. The imagery of a table as a trap and snare highlights the irony of provision turning into a curse due to disbelief. The words ‘table’, ‘snare’, ‘trap’, and ‘stumbling block’ are drawn from the original context to convey a cohesive understanding of spiritual blindness and its repercussions.|
|ROM 11:10|Let their eyes be darkened so that they cannot see, and bend their backs continually.|In this verse, Paul invokes a strong prophetic imagery similar to that found in Isaiah and the Gospels, emphasizing spiritual blindness and a hardening of the heart as a result of rejection. The phrase captures both a judgment and a sense of hopelessness regarding the understanding of the truth.|
|ROM 11:11|I say then, have they stumbled that they should fall? Certainly not! But through their fall, salvation has come to the Gentiles, to provoke them to jealousy.|This verse addresses the question of whether Israel's stumble led to their downfall, affirming instead that their transgression resulted in the opportunity for salvation to the Gentiles, ultimately aiming to provoke Israel to jealousy. The use of terms like 'stumble,' 'salvation,' and 'jealousy' are pivotal for understanding the message conveyed in the context of God's plan for both Israel and the Gentiles.|
|ROM 11:12|If their transgression has brought riches to the world and their failure has enriched the Gentiles, how much more will their full restoration mean?|The verse emphasizes the contrast between the consequences of Israel's disobedience and the resulting blessings for the Gentiles. It poses a rhetorical question that highlights the greater blessings that will arise from the full restoration of Israel.|
|ROM 11:13|But I am speaking to you, Gentiles. Inasmuch as I am an apostle to the Gentiles, I glorify my ministry.|The apostle Paul identifies himself here specifically as the apostle to the Gentiles, emphasizing his mission and service towards them. The phrase 'to the Gentiles' refers to non-Jews, indicating a wider audience for the gospel.|
|ROM 11:14|If somehow I could provoke my own people to jealousy and save some of them.|In this verse, Paul expresses a desire that his ministry to the Gentiles might provoke some jealousy in his fellow Israelites, leading them to seek salvation. The use of 'flesh' metaphorically refers to the physical lineage of Israel, indicating a longing for their salvation through the awakening of jealousy. This ties into the overarching theme of Paul's epistles where he discusses the relationship between Israel and the Gentiles, highlighting the grace extended to both.|
|ROM 11:15|For if their rejection meant the reconciliation of the world, what will their acceptance mean but life from the dead?|In this verse, Paul reflects on the concept of rejection and acceptance within the context of God's plan for salvation. The word 'reconciliation' here is significant as it conveys the idea of restoring a relationship, which aligns with the theme of life emerging from death as a central Christian belief. The contrast between 'rejection' and 'acceptance' illustrates the gravity of what it means for both Israel and the world at large.|
|ROM 11:16|If the firstfruits are holy, so is the whole batch; and if the root is holy, so are the branches.|In this verse, the terms 'firstfruits' and 'holy' are significant. 'Firstfruits' refers to the initial yield of a harvest, signifying something set apart for God. 'Holy' conveys a sense of being consecrated or dedicated to God, indicating the spiritual state of both the first fruits and the root in a metaphorical sense. The passage emphasizes the interconnectedness of the Jewish people and the Gentiles in God's redemptive plan, where both are seen as part of a single harvest.|
|ROM 11:17|But if some of the branches were broken off, and you, being a wild olive tree, were grafted in among them and became a partaker of the root and richness of the olive tree,|In this verse, Paul uses the metaphor of an olive tree to illustrate the relationship between Israel (the natural branches) and Gentile believers (the wild olive shoot) who have been grafted in. The terms 'wild olive' and 'grafted in' emphasize the unexpected grace of God towards Gentiles, incorporating them into the promises originally given to Israel. The use of 'root' and 'richness' signifies the source of spiritual nourishment that Gentiles now partake in through faith.|
|ROM 11:18|Do not boast against the branches. But if you do boast, remember that you do not support the root, but the root supports you.|This verse warns against arrogance in the context of the relationship between Gentiles and the Jewish people concerning salvation. The metaphor of the root and branches emphasizes that the Gentiles' position is dependent on their connection to God's covenant people, not on any superiority of their own.|
|ROM 11:19|You will say then, 'Branches were broken off so that I might be grafted in.'|This verse continues the metaphor of the olive tree, indicating that the branches (Israel) were broken off for the sake of the Gentiles. It serves as a warning against pride and a reminder of the divine economy in salvation, emphasizing the importance of humility in understanding one's place in God’s plan.|
|ROM 11:20|Quite right; they were broken off because of their unbelief, but you stand firm through faith. Do not be arrogant, but fear.|In this verse, Paul highlights the importance of faith and warns against pride, which resonates with similar themes found in other scripture. The Greek term 'ἀπιστίᾳ' (apistia) means unbelief or faithlessness, while 'πίστει' (pistei) translates to faith. The instruction to fear is also a significant exhortation in biblical texts, calling for humility in recognition of one's standing before God.|
|ROM 11:21|For if God did not spare the natural branches, He will not spare you either.|In this verse, the Apostle Paul emphasizes the seriousness of God's judgment by illustrating how He did not spare those who are His own (the natural branches), implying that Gentile believers should take heed and remain humble, understanding that God's mercy is not to be taken for granted.|
|ROM 11:22|Behold therefore the kindness and severity of God: on those who fell, severity; but toward you, kindness, if you continue in His kindness; otherwise you also will be cut off.|In this verse, the Apostle Paul highlights both the severity and the kindness of God. The contrasting terms 'kindness' (χρηστότης) and 'severity' (ἀποτομία) illustrate God's dual nature towards humanity. The admonition to remain in His kindness if one desires to continue receiving His favor reflects a core Christian teaching of perseverance in faith.|
|ROM 11:23|And they also, if they do not continue in their unbelief, will be grafted in; for God is able to graft them in again.|The verse discusses the potential for the re-engrafting of Israel into God's plan, emphasizing God's ability to restore and the necessity of faithfulness to Him. The term 'ἐγκεντρισθήσονται' implies being grafted back in, indicating a restoration contingent upon belief.|
|ROM 11:24|For if you were cut out of the wild olive tree, which is by nature and were grafted contrary to nature into a cultivated olive tree, how much more shall these, who are the natural branches, be grafted into their own olive tree?|In this verse, Paul uses the metaphor of grafting to illustrate the inclusion of Gentiles into God's covenant people, emphasizing the remarkable grace of God. The use of 'grafted' highlights the unnatural process of bringing in the wild olive tree (Gentiles) into the cultivated olive tree (Israel), implying that if the natural branches can be re-grafted, much more can the wild branches be integrated back into the original root.|
|ROM 11:25|For I do not want you, brethren, to be uninformed of this mystery, so that you will not be wise in your own estimation, that a partial hardening has come upon Israel until the full number of the Gentiles comes in.|The term 'hardening' (πώρωσις) is significant as it indicates a spiritual dullness or inability to perceive truth, which is contrasted here with the divine plan for salvation through the inclusion of the Gentiles. The phrase 'until the fullness of the Gentiles has come in' speaks to the divine timeline and the eventual inclusion of all who believe in Christ, both Jew and Gentile.|
|ROM 11:26|And in this way, all Israel will be saved, as it is written: "The Deliverer will come from Zion; He will turn away ungodliness from Jacob."|The phrase 'all Israel will be saved' emphasizes the future hope of redemption for the nation of Israel as a collective, affirming God's promise to His people. The term 'deliverer' in the context connects to the prophetic role of the Messiah, signifying God's intervention to save His people from their sins and restore them. The reference to Zion is significant in biblical prophecy as a place of divine deliverance and redemption.|
|ROM 11:27|And this will be My covenant with them when I take away their sins.|This verse emphasizes the promise of God to establish a new covenant with Israel, highlighting the forgiveness of sins as a key aspect of that covenant. The term 'diathēkē' (covenant) is central to understanding God's relationship with His people, as it signifies a solemn agreement involving blessings and obligations. The act of 'forgiving sins' is crucial in the context of salvation and redemption in the Biblical narrative.|
|ROM 11:28|As far as the gospel is concerned, they are enemies for your sake; but as far as election is concerned, they are beloved because of the patriarchs.|This verse highlights the duality in the relationship of Israel with God. It expresses the tension between being 'enemies' of the Gospel while simultaneously being 'beloved' for the sake of the patriarchs. The translation aims to preserve this nuance.|
|ROM 11:29|For the gifts and the calling of God are irrevocable.|The term 'ἀμεταμέλητα' denotes a sense of irrevocability, implying that God's gifts and calling cannot be revoked or taken back. This underscores God's faithfulness and unchanging nature in fulfilling His promises to His people.|
|ROM 11:30|For just as you once disobeyed God, now you have received mercy because of their disobedience.|This verse highlights the contrast between past disobedience and the present mercy shown to those who had once rebelled against God. The word 'mercy' is pivotal in this context, reflecting God's grace towards those who were previously outside of His favor. The original Greek terms emphasize the transition from rejection to acceptance.|
|ROM 11:31|So they too have now disobeyed, in order that, by your mercy, they may also receive mercy.|This verse emphasizes the reciprocal nature of mercy—highlighting how the disobedience of one group leads to mercy for another. It follows the earlier context about Gentiles receiving mercy due to Israel's disobedience, and it carries a tone of hope and interconnectedness between Jewish and Gentile believers in Christ.|
|ROM 11:32|For God has consigned all to disobedience, that He may have mercy on all.|In this verse, the concept of God closing all people under disobedience serves a dual purpose: it emphasizes humanity's collective need for mercy and highlights God's sovereignty in the plan of salvation. The use of 'εἰς ἀπείθειαν' conveys a state of disobedience, whereas 'ἐλεήσῃ' points to God's act of mercy, aligning with the overarching themes of grace and redemption present in Paul's letter to the Romans.|
|ROM 11:33|Oh, the depth of the riches and wisdom and knowledge of God! How unsearchable are His judgments and how inscrutable His ways!|This verse expresses the depth and unsearchable nature of God's wisdom and knowledge, emphasizing His perfect understanding and the mysterious nature of His ways. The word 'depth' (βάθος) suggests a profound, immeasurable quality, while 'unsearchable' (ἀνεξερεύνητα) highlights the impossibility of fully comprehending God’s judgments and paths.|
|ROM 11:34|For who has known the mind of the Lord? Or who has been His counselor?|This verse reflects the depth of God's wisdom and the futility of thinking we can fully comprehend or advise Him. It uses rhetorical questions to emphasize God's supreme understanding and independence from human counsel.|
|ROM 11:35|Or who has given to God, that God should repay him?|This verse questions the idea of any human offering something to God that would require Him to repay it. It emphasizes God's sovereignty and the futility of thinking one can contribute to God’s greatness or existence in a way that necessitates a reciprocal action from Him.|
|ROM 11:36|For from Him and through Him and to Him are all things. To Him be the glory forever. Amen.|This verse encapsulates the foundational belief in God's sovereignty over all creation, emphasizing that everything originates from, exists through, and is ultimately destined for God. The doxology highlights the eternal nature of God's glory, affirming that He is worthy of praise for all time.|
