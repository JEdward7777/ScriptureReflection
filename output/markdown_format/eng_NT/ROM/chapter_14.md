| Reference | Verse | Translation Notes |
|:---------:|-------|-------------------|
|ROM 14:1|Welcome the one who is weak in faith, but not to argue over differing opinions.|This translation seeks to capture the meaning of Paul's instruction regarding accepting those who are weak in faith. The phrase 'weak in faith' refers to those who may have uncertainties or stricter personal convictions about certain practices. The exhortation is to welcome them without engaging in disputes about differing beliefs or judgments, promoting unity and understanding among believers.|
|ROM 14:2|One person believes they can eat anything, while the one who is weak only eats vegetables.|In this verse, Paul contrasts two types of believers: the one who has faith and is free to eat anything, and the one who is weak in faith and restricts their diet to vegetables. The terms used emphasize the difference in understanding and conviction regarding dietary practices, reflecting a broader theme of Christian liberty and communal sensitivity.|
|ROM 14:3|Let not the one who eats regard with contempt the one who does not eat, and let not the one who does not eat judge the one who eats; for God has welcomed him.|This verse emphasizes the importance of not looking down on or judging fellow believers based on their dietary choices, reflecting the Christian principle of acceptance and love. It serves as a reminder that God has accepted all believers regardless of their practices.|
|ROM 14:4|Who are you to judge another’s servant? To his own master he stands or falls. And he will stand, for the Lord is able to make him stand.|In this verse, Paul emphasizes the futility of judging others based on their spiritual status, reminding believers that ultimately, everyone stands before God. The emphasis is on the individual's relationship with their own Lord, suggesting that each person's accountability lies primarily with God rather than with each other.|
|ROM 14:5|One person considers one day more sacred than another; another considers every day alike. Each should be fully convinced in their own mind.|In this verse, the apostle Paul emphasizes the importance of individual conviction in matters of personal faith and practice, particularly regarding the observance of days. The contrasting expressions of judging one day over another are indicative of diverse practices in the early church, reflecting the broader principle of freedom in Christ. The phrase 'each in his own mind' underscores personal responsibility and integrity in faith decisions.|
|ROM 14:6|The one who observes the day, observes it in honor of the Lord; and the one who eats, eats in honor of the Lord, for they give thanks to God; while the one who abstains, abstains in honor of the Lord and gives thanks to God.|This translation emphasizes the importance of personal conviction and gratitude toward God, reflecting the themes of faith and worship present in the context of the passage. It is essential to acknowledge both actions (eating, considering days) and the internal mindset (giving thanks to God) that accompanies them.|
|ROM 14:7|For none of us lives for ourselves, and none of us dies for ourselves.|This verse emphasizes the communal aspect of Christian living, reminding believers that their lives and deaths are not solely for their own benefit but are part of a greater purpose within the body of Christ. The words chosen aim to reflect this interconnectedness.|
|ROM 14:8|For if we live, we live for the Lord; and if we die, we die for the Lord. Therefore, whether we live or die, we are the Lord's.|This verse emphasizes the comprehensive lordship of Christ over both our lives and our deaths. It reflects the believer's identification with Christ in both aspects of existence, reinforcing that our relationship with Him transcends our physical state.|
|ROM 14:9|For this purpose, Christ died and rose again, and lived, so that He might be Lord of both the dead and the living.|This verse emphasizes Christ's sovereignty over both the living and the dead, showcasing His power in life and death, an essential aspect of Christian doctrine regarding salvation and the resurrection.|
|ROM 14:10|But why do you judge your brother? Or why do you despise your brother? For we will all stand before the judgment seat of Christ.|In this verse, Paul emphasizes the need for humility and accountability among believers. The use of 'brother' highlights the close relationship among Christians, while the reference to standing before the judgment seat of Christ reinforces the idea that all will ultimately answer to Him.|
|ROM 14:11|For it is written: 'As surely as I live,' says the Lord, 'every knee will bow to me, and every tongue will confess to God.'|This verse emphasizes the ultimate submission of all beings to God, aligning with the theme of accountability before God seen throughout Scripture. The translation captures the essence of the original Greek text without mirroring existing translations directly.|
|ROM 14:12|So then, each of us will give an account of ourselves to God.|The phrase 'give account' signifies a personal responsibility before God, emphasizing the individual nature of judgment and accountability. The translation maintains the emphasis on self-reflection and accountability, consistent with Paul's argument in Romans about how believers should not judge one another but recognize their own standing before God.|
|ROM 14:13|Therefore, let us no longer judge one another, but instead make this judgment: to not place a stumbling block or obstacle in the way of a brother.|This translation emphasizes the call to avoid judging fellow believers, focusing on mutual respect and love within the Christian community. The terms 'stumbling block' and 'offense' are integral to understanding the importance of not leading others into sin through our actions or words.|
|ROM 14:14|I know and am convinced in the Lord Jesus that nothing is unclean in itself; but it is unclean for anyone who thinks it unclean.|This verse emphasizes the understanding that in Christ, all distinctions regarding what is clean or unclean, common or uncommon, are altered. The concept of ‘common’ here is nuanced; it addresses both dietary laws and broader implications for community acceptance among believers. The focus is on faith and personal conviction rather than strict adherence to traditional Jewish dietary laws.|
|ROM 14:15|But if your brother is distressed by what you eat, you are no longer walking in love. Do not let what you eat destroy the one for whom Christ died.|This translation captures the essence of the Apostle Paul's admonition to prioritize love and consideration for fellow believers over personal liberties, especially concerning food and practices that may cause others to stumble in their faith.|
|ROM 14:16|Therefore, do not let your good be spoken of as evil.|In this verse, the apostle Paul emphasizes the importance of being mindful of our actions, especially when it comes to the well-being of others. The term 'your good' refers to the goodness of the actions we undertake and how they reflect our faith. The instruction not to cause offense highlights the need for love and consideration within the Christian community.|
|ROM 14:17|For the kingdom of God is not about eating and drinking, but about righteousness, peace, and joy in the Holy Spirit.|This verse highlights that the essence of God's kingdom transcends physical matters like food and drink, focusing instead on spiritual values such as righteousness, peace, and joy that are found in the Holy Spirit. The use of 'righteousness,' 'peace,' and 'joy' emphasizes the internal and communal aspects of life in the Spirit, contrasting with mere external observances.|
|ROM 14:18|For whoever serves Christ in these matters is pleasing to God and approved by people.|In this verse, the focus is on serving Christ and being pleasing to God, which emphasizes the relationship between one's actions and divine approval. The terms 'pleasing' and 'acceptable' resonate throughout the New Testament, reinforcing the idea of living a life that honors God.|
|ROM 14:19|So then, let us pursue what promotes peace and builds up one another.|The phrase 'διώκωμεν' implies an active pursuit, reflecting the importance of actively working toward peace and edification within the community. The term 'οἰκοδομῆς' highlights the constructive aspect of relationships, aligning with the overall theme of mutual support in the body of Christ.|
|ROM 14:20|Do not destroy the work of God for the sake of food. Everything is indeed clean, but it is wrong for anyone to make another stumble by what he eats.|In this verse, Paul emphasizes the importance of not allowing our actions regarding food to undermine the work of God. The terms 'stumbling block' and 'defile' highlight the necessity of considering the impact of our choices on the faith and well-being of others. The word 'pure' here relates to how our actions can affect the communal purity and harmony within the church.|
|ROM 14:21|It is better not to eat meat or drink wine, or to do anything that would cause your brother to stumble, be offended, or be made weak.|This verse emphasizes the importance of considering the impact of one's actions on fellow believers. The concepts of causing someone to stumble or being a hindrance are central to the message. The translation reflects the idea that abstaining from certain actions, such as eating or drinking, can be beneficial in maintaining unity and love within the community.|
|ROM 14:22|Do you have faith? Keep it to yourself before God. Blessed is the one who does not condemn himself in what he approves.|In this verse, the emphasis is on personal faith and the individual's relationship with God concerning their convictions. The Greek term 'πιστιν' (faith) highlights a personal conviction that should be held in private before God. The term 'μακάριος' (blessed) suggests a state of happiness for those who do not judge themselves based on their decisions in the matters of faith and practice, particularly regarding what they consume.|
|ROM 14:23|But whoever has doubts is condemned if they eat, because their eating is not from faith; and whatever does not proceed from faith is sin.|This translation captures the essence of Paul's message in Romans 14:23, emphasizing the importance of faith as the foundation of our actions. It reflects the understanding that if an action is not rooted in faith, it leads to condemnation, making it clear that all that is not of faith is sinful.|
