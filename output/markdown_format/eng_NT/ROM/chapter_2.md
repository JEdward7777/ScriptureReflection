| Reference | Verse | Translation Notes |
|:---------:|-------|-------------------|
|ROM 2:1|Therefore, you are without excuse, O man, everyone who judges; for in judging another, you condemn yourself, since you practice the very same things.|This verse emphasizes the hypocrisy of judging others while committing the same actions. It is a reminder that judgment against others is often a reflection of one's own shortcomings. The word 'ἀναπολόγητος' indicates being without excuse, highlighting that self-judgment is unavoidable when we condemn others for their faults.|
|ROM 2:2|But we know that the judgment of God is according to truth against those who practice such things.|In this verse, Paul emphasizes the nature of God's judgment, highlighting that it is based on truth. The use of 'truth' (ἀλήθεια) suggests an absolute standard against which actions are measured. The phrase 'those who practice such things' refers back to the sinful behaviors previously mentioned, reinforcing the idea that God's judgment is just and impartial.|
|ROM 2:3|And do you think, O man, that you will escape the judgment of God when you judge those who commit such acts and yet do the same things yourself?|This verse emphasizes the hypocrisy of judging others while being guilty of similar actions. It highlights the certainty of God's judgment that is inescapable for all, regardless of one’s self-righteousness.|
|ROM 2:4|Or do you show contempt for the riches of His kindness, forbearance, and patience, not realizing that God’s kindness is intended to lead you to repentance?|This verse emphasizes the misconception of taking God's kindness for granted and highlights the purpose of God's goodness in leading individuals toward repentance. The phrase 'the wealth of His goodness' suggests an abundance that God offers, while 'despising' indicates a rejection of His offers of mercy and patience.|
|ROM 2:5|But because of your stubbornness and unrepentant heart, you are storing up wrath for yourself on the day of wrath when God’s righteous judgment will be revealed.|The verse emphasizes the concept of storing up wrath as a consequence of a hard and unrepentant heart. It contrasts the idea of God’s kindness leading to repentance with the peril of neglecting that grace. The term 'day of wrath' and 'revelation of the righteous judgment of God' calls to mind the ultimate accountability each individual has before God.|
|ROM 2:6|He will repay each person according to their deeds.|The translation captures the essence of God's judgment according to individual deeds. The word 'ἀποδώσει' implies a returning or recompensing, emphasizing the action of giving back what is deserved based on one's actions. 'ἑκάστῳ' reflects the individual accountability each person has before God, while 'κατὰ τὰ ἔργα αὐτοῦ' highlights that the basis for this recompense is the works done by each individual.|
|ROM 2:7|To those who by perseverance in doing good seek glory, honor, and immortality, He will give eternal life.|In this translation, 'eternal life' is emphasized as the ultimate reward for perseverance in doing good. The words 'glory,' 'honor,' and 'immortality' align with the essence of what believers strive for as they endure trials. This reflects the reward for steadfastness in faith and good works.|
|ROM 2:8|But for those who are self-seeking and do not obey the truth but obey unrighteousness, there will be wrath and indignation.|The original Greek highlights the contrasting behaviors of those who are contentious and disobedient to truth versus those who align themselves with wrongdoing. The focus is on the divine response to each group, emphasizing God's righteous anger towards those who reject truth in favor of injustice.|
|ROM 2:9|There will be tribulation and distress for every human soul that does evil, for the Jew first and also for the Greek.|This verse highlights the concept of tribulation and distress that comes upon every soul of man who does evil, emphasizing the universality of judgment. The mention of both Jew and Greek underscores the impartiality of God’s judgment, transcending ethnic and cultural distinctions.|
|ROM 2:10|but glory and honor and peace to everyone who does good, to the Jew first and also to the Greek.|In this verse, Paul emphasizes the concepts of glory, honor, and peace, which are given to those who do good. It serves as a contrast to the previous verse regarding judgment for wrongdoing. The term 'working good' is a central theme in Pauline theology, which underscores the importance of moral action and the consequent divine reward. The structure reflects the Jewish precedence in receiving God's promises but equally affirms the inclusion of Gentiles in the blessings of salvation.|
|ROM 2:11|For there is no favoritism with God.|This translation emphasizes the impartial nature of God, reflecting the principle that divine judgment does not favor one group over another based on ethnicity or social status, as shown in related verses.|
|ROM 2:12|For all who have sinned without the Law will perish without the Law; and all who have sinned under the Law will be judged by the Law.|This translation emphasizes the distinction between those who sin without knowledge of the law and those who sin under the law. The terms used in the Greek suggest a clear moral accountability for actions taken regardless of the awareness of the law.|
|ROM 2:13|For it is not the hearers of the Law who are justified before God, but the doers of the Law will be justified.|This translation emphasizes the distinction between mere hearing of the Law and the actual doing of its commands. The terms 'hearers' and 'doers' have been used intentionally to parallel the original text's focus on the difference between simply listening to the Law and living it out. The structure is kept straightforward to reflect the original Greek's clarity.|
|ROM 2:14|For when Gentiles, who do not have the Law, by nature do what the Law requires, they are a law to themselves, even though they do not have the Law.|In this verse, Paul is emphasizing the moral compass present in all humanity, suggesting that even those without the written law (the Gentiles) are capable of recognizing and adhering to God's moral standards through their innate understanding of right and wrong. The term 'law' here refers to both the written law and the natural law that can be discerned through human conscience and nature.|
|ROM 2:15|They demonstrate that the work of the law is written on their hearts, their conscience bearing witness to this, and their thoughts either accusing or defending them.|In this verse, the Apostle Paul emphasizes the internal moral compass that individuals possess, referring to the 'work of the law' that is written on their hearts. This suggests that even without explicit knowledge of the Law, people can have an innate understanding of right and wrong, aided by their conscience. The words 'showing,' 'written,' 'hearts,' 'testifying,' and 'thoughts' have been carefully chosen to reflect both the moral and spiritual dimensions conveyed in the original Greek text.|
|ROM 2:16|on the day when God judges the secrets of men by my gospel through Jesus Christ.|This verse emphasizes the day of God's judgment and aligns with the theme of accountability found in other scriptures. The phrase 'the hidden things of men' signifies both actions and intentions that may not be visible to others but are known to God. The reference to the Gospel of Christ establishes the basis on which this judgment will occur.|
|ROM 2:17|Indeed, you bear the name of Jew, and rely on the Law, and boast in your relationship with God.|This verse addresses the Jewish identity and the reliance on the Law for righteousness, highlighting the false security found in mere heritage and religious practice rather than true faith and obedience to God.|
|ROM 2:18|and you know His will, and approve the things that are excellent, being instructed out of the Law,|This verse emphasizes the knowledge of God's will and the ability to discern between what is right and wrong, as instructed by the Law. It reflects the theme of understanding spiritual matters through divine instruction and moral guidance.|
|ROM 2:19|You are confident that you can guide the blind, a light for those who are in darkness.|In this verse, Paul addresses the issue of self-perception among those who consider themselves teachers or guides, particularly in a spiritual sense. The metaphor of 'blindness' is crucial, indicating a lack of understanding or spiritual insight, which is paralleled in the related verses.|
|ROM 2:20|an instructor of the foolish, a teacher of children, having in the Law the embodiment of knowledge and truth.|This verse emphasizes the role of the Jew as an educator and guide who possesses knowledge and truth through the Law. It contrasts the wise teacher with the unwise or immature, implying that mere knowledge of the Law is not enough without true understanding and application of its principles.|
|ROM 2:21|You, therefore, who teach others, do you not teach yourself? You who preach against stealing, do you steal?|In this translation, the focus is on the contrast between teaching and practice, reflecting the call to integrity in one’s actions in relation to their teachings. The rhetorical questions emphasize the hypocrisy of proclaiming a moral standard while failing to adhere to it.|
|ROM 2:22|You who say, ‘Do not commit adultery,’ do you commit adultery? You who detest idols, do you rob temples?|The original Greek phrase 'ὁ λέγων μὴ μοιχεύειν' directly translates to 'the one saying do not commit adultery,' emphasizing the hypocrisy in teaching against actions one is committing oneself. The term 'ἱεροσυλεῖς' refers to a violation of sacred things, linking idolatry to a serious sin akin to blasphemy in the Christian context. The translation reflects the rhetorical questioning style found in the original text.|
|ROM 2:23|You who boast in the Law, do you dishonor God by breaking the Law?|In this verse, Paul addresses hypocrisy among those who take pride in their adherence to the Law while failing to observe its true requirements. The term 'boast' implies a sense of arrogance or self-righteousness in one's position. The phrase 'through the transgression of the law' highlights the contradiction in their behavior and the impact of their actions on their relationship with God.|
|ROM 2:24|For the name of God is blasphemed among the nations because of you, as it is written.|In this verse, Paul references the reproach brought upon God's name due to the behavior of those who are supposed to represent Him. The term 'blasphemed' conveys the gravity of misrepresenting God's character and intentions, particularly to those outside the faith.|
|ROM 2:25|For circumcision indeed has value if you practice the law; but if you are a transgressor of the law, your circumcision has become as if it were uncircumcision.|In this verse, the Apostle Paul contrasts the value of circumcision with the adherence to the Law. The emphasis is on the inner moral state rather than merely the outward sign of the covenant. The term 'circumcision' refers not only to the physical act but also to a state of spiritual condition, paralleling the concept of being a true follower of God who acts in accordance with His commandments.|
|ROM 2:26|Therefore, if an uncircumcised man keeps the righteous requirements of the law, will not his uncircumcision be counted as circumcision?|This verse highlights the idea that true obedience to God's law is not merely a matter of physical circumcision or uncircumcision, but is instead defined by the practice of the law itself. It addresses the Jewish audience's reliance on circumcision as a marker of righteousness while emphasizing that the true essence of the law transcends physical status.|
|ROM 2:27|And the one who is physically uncircumcised but fulfills the law will judge you, who possess the law written and the sign of circumcision, yet still violate the law.|This verse emphasizes the concept of true righteousness coming not from external adherence to the law (like circumcision) but from an inner moral alignment that aligns with God's standards. It contrasts the value of the letter of the law with the inherent righteousness that can exist in those who do not bear the outward signs of covenant, pointing to a deeper spiritual understanding.|
|ROM 2:28|For he is not a Jew who is merely one outwardly, nor is circumcision something external and physical.|In this verse, Paul emphasizes the distinction between outward appearances and true identity in faith. The term 'Jew' is not merely a matter of ethnic lineage or physical circumcision, but pertains to an inward reality and genuine relationship with God.|
|ROM 2:29|But he is a Jew who is one inwardly, and circumcision is a matter of the heart, by the Spirit, not by the letter. His praise is not from man but from God.|In this verse, the Apostle Paul emphasizes the distinction between external religious identity and true spiritual identity. The contrast between 'the letter' (which refers to the written law) and 'the spirit' signifies that true obedience and belonging to God come from the heart rather than mere outward practices. The term 'praise' is used to show that true recognition and commendation come from God, rather than human approval.|
