The choice of words conveys a deep sense of sincerity and accountability in his proclamation. The phrase 'in Christ' is significant as it roots his honesty in his relationship with Jesus, while the mention of the 'Holy Spirit' denotes the divine assurance backing his statement.|
|ROM 9:2|I have great sorrow and unceasing anguish in my heart.|In this verse, Paul expresses deep sorrow and unceasing anguish in his heart concerning his fellow Israelites. The terms used, such as 'great sorrow' and 'unceasing anguish,' emphasize the depth of his emotional state. The phrase captures a sense of personal pain connected to the plight of his people, reflecting the intensity of his feelings.|
|ROM 9:3|For I could wish that I myself were accursed and cut off from Christ for the sake of my brothers, my kinsmen according to the flesh.|In this verse, Paul expresses a profound depth of feeling for his people, the Israelites, reflecting both his personal anguish and his willingness to sacrifice for their sake. The term 'anathema' is used here in a unique way to convey the seriousness of his love and sorrow for his kin according to the flesh.|
|ROM 9:4|They are Israelites; to them belong the adoption as sons, the glory, the covenants, the giving of the Law, the worship, and the promises.|In this verse, the Apostle Paul emphasizes the unique privileges and heritage of the Israelites, highlighting their roles and responsibilities within God’s covenant. The use of terms like 'adoption' and 'glory' indicates their special relationship with God. The translation aims to reflect both the theological significance and the cultural context of the Israelites as the chosen people of God.|
|ROM 9:5|Theirs are the patriarchs, and from them, according to the flesh, comes the Christ, who is over all, God blessed forever. Amen.|In this verse, Paul highlights the divine and human nature of Christ, emphasizing his Jewish lineage while also declaring his divinity. The term 'blessed God' is a powerful affirmation of Christ's deity, reinforcing the idea of his supremacy over all things.|
|ROM 9:6|But it is not as though the word of God has failed. For not all who are descended from Israel belong to Israel.|This verse addresses the distinction between ethnic Israel and the true spiritual Israel, indicating that not all who are descended from Israel are part of the promise. The phrase ‘not all who are descended from Israel’ suggests that a mere physical lineage does not guarantee inclusion in God's covenant people.|
|ROM 9:7|Neither is it that they are all children because they are Abraham's descendants, but through Isaac shall your offspring be called.|This verse emphasizes the concept of true spiritual lineage in God's plan, highlighting that mere physical descent from Abraham does not guarantee inclusion in God's covenant people. The reference to Isaac as the chosen one signifies that God's promise is fulfilled through specific lineage, underscoring the idea that spiritual heritage is determined by God's choice rather than human ancestry.|
|ROM 9:8|This means that it is not the children of the flesh who are the children of God, but the children of the promise are counted as offspring.|This verse emphasizes the distinction between physical descendants and spiritual heirs, specifically those who are considered children of God through the promise, reflecting the covenant relationship established with Abraham and his lineage through faith rather than mere biological descent.|

The focus is on the timing of the promise and its miraculous nature, emphasizing God's sovereignty and faithfulness.|
|ROM 9:10|And not only that, but Rebekah also conceived by one man, our father Isaac.|This verse introduces Rebekah's significance in the lineage of promise. The term 'one womb' emphasizes the divine choice and the miraculous conception tied to Isaac. It's important to highlight that this is not just a biological fact but a theological point regarding God's selection of the lineage through which His promises would be fulfilled.|
|ROM 9:11|for the children had not yet been born and had done nothing good or bad, in order that God’s purpose of election might continue, not because of works, but because of him who calls.|This verse emphasizes the doctrine of election and predestination, highlighting that God's purpose in choosing individuals is not based on their actions, but rather on His divine will and calling. The phrase 'before they had done any good or evil' signifies the unconditional nature of God's election, asserting that it is solely based on His grace and not human merit.|
|ROM 9:12|It was said to her, 'The elder will serve the younger.'|This verse expresses the principle of divine sovereignty in election, illustrating how God's choice is not based on human standards of greatness or worthiness.

|ROM 9:14|What then shall we say? Is there injustice on God’s part? By no means!|In this verse, the rhetorical question emphasizes the injustice attributed to God.

This translation aims to reflect the gravity of questioning God's character while maintaining the original intent of the text.|
|ROM 9:15|For He says to Moses, "I will have mercy on whom I choose to have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I choose to have compassion."|This verse is a direct quotation from God's declaration to Moses regarding His sovereignty in showing mercy. The emphasis is on God's prerogative to choose whom to show mercy to, illustrating His divine authority and purpose in salvation.|
|ROM 9:16|Therefore, it is not by the one who wills, nor by the one who runs, but by God who shows mercy.|This verse emphasizes the sovereignty of God in the exercise of mercy. It underscores that it is not dependent on human effort or desire, but solely on God's will and grace.|
|ROM 9:17|For the Scripture says to Pharaoh, 'I have raised you up for this very purpose, that I might display My power in you, and that My name might be proclaimed throughout all the earth.'|In this verse, Paul references God's purpose in raising up Pharaoh to demonstrate His power and proclaim His name. The focus is on divine sovereignty and the revelation of God's character through history, particularly in relation to Israel's deliverance from Egypt.|
|ROM 9:18|Therefore, He has mercy on whom He chooses to have mercy, and whom He chooses, He hardens.|This verse emphasizes God's sovereignty in exercising mercy and judgment.

Will the thing formed say to the One who formed it, 'Why did you make me like this?'|In this verse, Paul addresses the human tendency to question God’s authority and purpose in creating individuals with different destinies. The language captures the imagery of the Creator and the created, echoing themes found in the prophetic literature of the Old Testament.|
|ROM 9:21|Does not the potter have authority over the clay, to make from the same lump one vessel for honor and another for dishonor?|This verse emphasizes the authority of the potter (God) over the clay (humanity), illustrating the sovereignty of God in creation and purpose. The terms 'honor' and 'dishonor' (τιμὴν and ἀτιμίαν) represent the distinct roles or fates of individuals created by God, which may reflect His divine will and purpose in salvation and judgment.|
|ROM 9:22|What if God, wanting to demonstrate His wrath and to make known His power, endured with great patience the vessels of wrath prepared for destruction?|In this verse, Paul presents God's sovereignty and justice in the face of human unworthiness. The imagery of 'vessels of wrath' emphasizes God's authority over creation and the purpose of divine patience, which allows for the demonstration of His power and righteousness.|
|ROM 9:23|And that He might make known the riches of His glory upon vessels of mercy, which He had prepared beforehand for glory.|This translation emphasizes God's intention to reveal the riches of His glory to those He has chosen, highlighting both His mercy and the purpose behind creating vessels for His mercy. The phrase 'vessels of mercy' underscores God's sovereign choice and the grace extended to believers.|
|ROM 9:24|whom He has called, not only from the Jews, but also from among the Gentiles.|This translation aims to convey the inclusive call of God, emphasizing His sovereign choice that extends beyond just one ethnic group to include all who believe, resonating with the broader biblical narrative of salvation for both Jews and Gentiles.|
|ROM 9:25|As He says also in Hosea, 'I will call those who were not My people, 'My people,' and her who was not beloved, 'Beloved.'|This verse illustrates God's divine calling, indicating that those who were previously considered 'not My people' are now welcomed into His family. The context is rooted in God's covenant faithfulness, reflecting the inclusion of Gentiles in His redemptive plan, echoing the prophetic voice of Hosea.|
|ROM 9:26|And it will be in the place where it was said to them, 'You are not My people,' there they will be called 'Sons of the living God.'|In this verse, the Apostle Paul references Hosea to illustrate God's grace and the transformative calling of those who were previously estranged from Him. The phrase 'sons of the living God' emphasizes the relationship believers now have with God, contrasting their past status as not being His people.|
|ROM 9:27|Isaiah cries out concerning Israel: 'Though the number of the children of Israel be as the sand of the sea, only a remnant will be saved.'|This verse emphasizes the concept of a faithful remnant within Israel, drawing on the imagery of the numerous descendants being reduced to a smaller group that will be saved. It echoes themes found throughout Isaiah, particularly regarding God's judgment and mercy.|
|ROM 9:28|For He will carry out His word on the earth, thoroughly and swiftly, as the Lord has decreed.|In this verse, Paul quotes the prophetic language that underscores the Lord’s determination to bring about justice and righteousness in a decisive way. The phrase 'a word' signifies God’s spoken decree that results in action. The use of 'cutting short' indicates that the Lord's work will be efficient and thorough, ensuring that justice prevails on the earth, which aligns with the overarching theme of God's sovereignty and redemptive plan for His people.|
|ROM 9:29|And just as Isaiah predicted, unless the Lord of Hosts had left us a seed, we would have become like Sodom, and we would have been made like Gomorrah.|This verse references Isaiah's prophecy about the remnant of Israel that God preserves despite judgment. It highlights the mercy of God in preserving a faithful remnant. The choice of words connects the fate of Sodom and Gomorrah to the idea of divine judgment and mercy, illustrating the contrast between total destruction and God's sustaining grace.|
|ROM 9:30|What shall we say then? That the Gentiles, who were not pursuing righteousness, have obtained righteousness, even the righteousness that comes through faith.|This verse emphasizes the contrast between the pursuit of righteousness through works and the righteousness attained by faith. It illustrates how the Gentiles, who did not actively seek God's righteousness, obtained it through their faith, while Israel pursued it through their own efforts but failed to achieve it.|
|ROM 9:31|But Israel, pursuing the law of righteousness, has not attained to the law of righteousness.|This verse highlights the failure of Israel to attain righteousness through the law, in contrast to the Gentiles who have obtained righteousness by faith. The term 'pursuing' implies a diligent effort, yet despite this effort, Israel fell short of the intended righteousness of God. The term 'law' refers to the Mosaic Law, which Israel pursued as a means of establishing their own righteousness, but this pursuit was ultimately unfruitful in achieving God's standard.|
|ROM 9:32|Why? Because they sought it not by faith, but as it were by the works of the law. They stumbled at that stumbling stone.|This verse emphasizes the distinction between faith and the works of the law, reflecting the broader theme in Romans regarding righteousness and how it is attained. The phrase 'stone of stumbling' refers to Christ and the faith required to accept Him, which some reject in favor of legalistic righteousness.|
|ROM 9:33|As it is written: 'Behold, I lay in Zion a stone of stumbling and a rock of offense, and whoever believes in Him will not be put to shame.'|This verse references the fulfillment of the prophecy regarding the cornerstone, drawing on the imagery of stumbling and belief. The use of 'stumbling stone' and 'rock of offense' indicates the dual nature of Christ's coming—an offering for some and a point of conflict for others. This translation maintains the original structure while using contemporary language for clarity.|
