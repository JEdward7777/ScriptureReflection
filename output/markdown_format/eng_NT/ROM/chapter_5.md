| Reference | Verse | Translation Notes |
|:---------:|-------|-------------------|
|ROM 5:1|Therefore, having been justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ.|This translation emphasizes the relationship of believers to God through faith and highlights the peace that results from that relationship. The words chosen reflect the theological significance of justification and peace, staying true to the original Greek intent.|
|ROM 5:2|Through whom we have also obtained access by faith into this grace in which we stand, and we rejoice in the hope of the glory of God.|In this verse, the concepts of faith, grace, and glory are interconnected. The term 'prosgoge' refers to the access or approach to God granted through faith, emphasizing the relationship between believers and God. This fresh translation aims to maintain the theological significance of grace and the joy in hope that believers have in God's glory.|
|ROM 5:3|And not only that, but we also rejoice in our sufferings, knowing that suffering produces endurance,|The verse emphasizes the value of suffering and the resulting endurance it produces. The term 'καυχώμεθα' (we boast) signifies a positive attitude towards hardships, reflecting a Christian perspective on trials. This verse encourages believers to view tribulations as a means to develop resilience.|
|ROM 5:4|and endurance produces tested character, and tested character produces hope.|In this translation, I aim to capture the essence of perseverance leading to testing, and the testing leading to hope. The Greek terms for 'endurance' (ὑπομονὴ), 'testing' (δοκιμή), and 'hope' (ἐλπίδα) are pivotal in this verse, linking our experiences in life to a greater spiritual understanding.|
|ROM 5:5|And hope does not put us to shame, because God’s love has been poured into our hearts through the Holy Spirit who has been given to us.|This verse emphasizes that true hope does not disappoint because it is anchored in the love of God which is poured into our hearts through the Holy Spirit. The original Greek phrase ‘ἐκκέχυται’ implies a generous outpouring, indicating that God’s love is abundant and transformative, which is vital for believers in sustaining hope.|
|ROM 5:6|For while we were still weak, at the appointed time Christ died for the ungodly.|This verse emphasizes the timing and purpose of Christ's sacrifice, highlighting His love for the ungodly. The phrase 'at just the right time' points to the divine timing in God's plan of salvation, while 'for the ungodly' signifies His selfless act on behalf of those who do not deserve it.|
|ROM 5:7|For scarcely will someone die for a righteous person; though perhaps for a good person someone would dare even to die.|The verse presents a reflection on the rarity of self-sacrifice for a righteous person, suggesting that while one might have courage to die for a good person, the idea of sacrificing oneself for the unrighteous is exceptional. This aligns with the theme of Christ's sacrifice in Romans, where He died for the ungodly, illustrating the profound nature of divine love and mercy.|
|ROM 5:8|But God demonstrates His own love toward us, in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us.|In this translation, I sought to capture the essence of God's love towards humanity, especially the sacrificial act of Christ's death for sinners. The terms 'love,' 'sinners,' and 'Christ' are pivotal to understanding the passage, reflecting God's character and His redemptive plan.|
|ROM 5:9|Much more then, having now been justified by His blood, we shall be saved from wrath through Him.|In this translation, emphasis is placed on the concept of justification and salvation through Christ's blood, highlighting the transition from a state of wrath to one of salvation. The phrase 'justified' is crucial to convey the theological significance of being declared righteous by God, while 'saved from wrath' illustrates the deliverance that believers experience through Christ's sacrificial act.|
|ROM 5:10|For if while we were enemies, we were reconciled to God through the death of His Son, much more, having been reconciled, we shall be saved by His life.|In this verse, the key theme is reconciliation between humanity and God through the death of Jesus Christ. The word 'enemies' refers to our state of separation from God due to sin, while 'reconciliation' indicates the restoration of that relationship. The phrase 'saved in His life' emphasizes the fullness of life we receive through Christ beyond just avoiding wrath.|
|ROM 5:11|And not only this, but we also exult in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we have now received reconciliation.|This verse emphasizes the joyful confidence that comes from our relationship with God through Christ. The Greek word for 'rejoice' (καυχώμενοι) carries the connotation of boasting or exulting, which underscores the believer's secure position in God.|
|ROM 5:12|Therefore, just as sin entered the world through one man, and death through sin, so death spread to all people because all sinned.|This verse articulates the theological concept that sin entered the world through Adam, leading to death for all humanity. It highlights the universality of sin and death, reflecting the profound impact of Adam's disobedience on the human condition. The translation aims to capture the essence of the original Greek, maintaining clarity while ensuring theological accuracy.|
|ROM 5:13|For until the law, sin was in the world; but sin is not charged against anyone when there is no law.|In this verse, Paul is addressing the nature of sin and the function of the Law. The key phrases 'sin' and 'law' are central to understanding the theological argument in this passage. The phrase 'until the law' highlights the role of the Law in defining sin, suggesting that sin exists even when not specifically counted against those who do not have the Law. This distinction helps clarify the relationship between humanity and God's commandments, particularly in the context of grace.|
|ROM 5:14|Yet death reigned from Adam until Moses, even over those who had not sinned in the same way as Adam, who is a type of the One to come.|This verse emphasizes the reign of death from Adam to Moses and connects it to the idea of innocence before the law. The mention of Adam as a type of the one to come underscores the theological link between the fall and the redemptive work of Christ.|
|ROM 5:15|But the gift is not like the trespass. For if the many died by the trespass of one man, how much more did God’s grace and the gift that came by the grace of the one man, Jesus Christ, overflow to the many!|In this verse, the contrast is made between the effect of Adam's transgression and the overwhelming grace offered through Christ. The term "grace" (χάρις) signifies a gift freely given, underscoring God's unmerited favor. The phrase "the gift of grace" emphasizes that this is not something earned but bestowed upon those who believe.|
|ROM 5:16|And the gift is not like the result of the one who sinned; for judgment arose from one sin, leading to condemnation, but the gift arose from many offenses, bringing justification.|In this verse, Paul contrasts the nature of judgment and gift. The term 'judgment' reflects the consequence of sin, while 'gift' refers to the grace given through Christ. The phrase 'one who sinned' indicates the single act of Adam, leading to condemnation, while the reference to 'many offenses' highlights the grace that overcomes numerous transgressions through Christ's sacrifice. This captures the profound difference between condemnation through sin and salvation through grace.|
|ROM 5:17|For if, by the transgression of one, death reigned through that one man, how much more will those who receive the abundance of grace and the gift of righteousness reign in life through the one man, Jesus Christ!|This verse contrasts the reign of death through Adam's transgression with the reigning of life through the grace and righteousness found in Jesus Christ. It highlights the abundance of grace and the transformative nature of Christ’s gift to believers, emphasizing the superiority of life and grace over the consequences of sin.|
|ROM 5:18|Therefore, just as one transgression led to condemnation for all people, so one act of righteousness leads to justification and life for all people.|This verse draws a parallel between the consequences of Adam's singular transgression, which led to condemnation for all humanity, and the singular act of righteousness by Christ that offers justification and life to all. The words 'condemnation' and 'justification' are central theological concepts in this context, illustrating the contrast between the effects of sin and the provision of salvation.|
|ROM 5:19|For just as through the disobedience of one man many were made sinners, so through the obedience of one man many will be made righteous.|In this verse, the contrast between disobedience and obedience is central. The word 'παρακοῆς' (disobedience) suggests a rebellion against God, which leads to sinfulness for many, while 'ὑπακοῆς' (obedience) indicates submission to God, leading to righteousness for many. The emphasis is on the collective nature of both actions and their consequences.|
|ROM 5:20|Now, the law came in alongside to magnify the trespass. But where sin abounded, grace overflowed even more.|In this verse, the Apostle Paul contrasts the role of the law with the abundance of grace. The phrase 'to increase the transgression' indicates the law's purpose in highlighting sin, while 'where sin increased' reflects the overwhelming nature of grace in response. This translation seeks to capture the original intent and theological depth of the Greek text without resorting to existing translations.|
|ROM 5:21|so that, just as sin reigned in death, grace might also reign through righteousness leading to eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.|In this verse, Paul contrasts the reign of sin, which leads to death, with the reign of grace, which leads to eternal life. The use of 'grace' as a sovereign force highlights its transformative power in the believer's life through righteousness, which is realized in Jesus Christ.|
