The Greek term 'λογικὴν' (logikēn) is translated here as 'reasonable' or 'spiritual', denoting a form of worship that is rational and aligns with the truth of the Gospel.|
|ROM 12:2|And do not conform to this world, but be transformed by the renewal of your mind, so that you may discern what is the good, acceptable, and perfect will of God.|In this translation, the focus is on the transformation of the believer's mind and their renewal in accordance with God's will. The terms used emphasize the contrast between worldly influence and divine guidance. The structure aims to convey the intended meaning of the original Greek text while remaining accessible to contemporary readers.|
|ROM 12:3|For by the grace given to me, I say to every one of you: Do not think of yourself more highly than you ought, but rather think of yourself with sober judgment, in accordance with the measure of faith God has given you.|In this verse, the Apostle Paul urges believers to maintain a humble perspective regarding themselves, emphasizing the importance of grace given by God. The term 'sober judgment' reflects a call for clear-minded self-assessment in accordance with faith given by God. This translation aims to encapsulate the essence of humility and reliance on divine grace without diluting the original meaning.|
|ROM 12:4|For just as we have many parts in one body, each of the parts does not have the same function.|This translation emphasizes the unity and diversity of the members within the body of Christ, reflecting the interdependence of believers in their collective service and function.|

The term 'body' refers to the collective entity of believers, while 'members' signify individual roles and contributions within that body.|
|ROM 12:6|Having gifts that differ according to the grace given to us, let us use them: if prophecy, in proportion to our faith.|This verse emphasizes the diversity of spiritual gifts within the church, which are distributed according to God’s grace.

|ROM 12:7|If your gift is serving, then serve; if it is teaching, then teach.|In this verse, Paul emphasizes the importance of fulfilling one's role in service and teaching within the community of believers.

Each gift mentioned is accompanied by a virtue that enhances the purpose of the gift, reflecting the spirit of serving within the community of believers.|
|ROM 12:9|Let love be genuine. Abhor what is evil; cling to what is good.|In this verse, the emphasis is on the authenticity and sincerity of love, contrasting it with hypocrisy.

|ROM 12:13|Contribute to the needs of the saints and seek to show hospitality.|This translation emphasizes the communal aspect of sharing and the imperative to practice hospitality, reflecting the original Greek words that indicate a sense of mutual care among believers.

|ROM 12:17|Repay no one evil for evil, but take thought for what is noble in the sight of all.|This verse emphasizes the principle of not retaliating against wrongdoers. It encourages believers to prioritize goodness and righteousness in their interactions with all people, regardless of their actions towards them.|
|ROM 12:18|If it is possible, so far as it depends on you, live peaceably with all.|The phrase 'if possible' suggests that while the desire for peace is emphasized, there are circumstances where achieving peace may be out of one’s control.
