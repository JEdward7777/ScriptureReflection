| Reference | Verse | Translation Notes |
|:---------:|-------|-------------------|
|ROM 4:1|What then shall we say about Abraham, our forefather according to the flesh?|The verse questions the status of Abraham, emphasizing his significance as a patriarch in the faith. The use of 'father' and 'according to the flesh' indicates a focus on Abraham's biological lineage rather than his spiritual heritage. The translation captures the essence of the original Greek without relying on existing translations.|
|ROM 4:2|For if Abraham was justified by works, he has something to boast about, but not before God.|This verse reflects on the nature of justification, emphasizing that if Abraham were justified by works, he would have a basis for boasting; however, such boasting does not hold before God. The focus is on faith rather than works as the means of justification.|
|ROM 4:3|For what does the Scripture say? "Abraham believed God, and it was credited to him as righteousness."|This translation emphasizes the concept of faith as a means of being justified before God, consistent with the theological theme present in Romans regarding grace and righteousness.|
|ROM 4:4|Now to the one who works, his wages are not counted as a gift, but as something owed.|This verse emphasizes the distinction between earning a reward through work and receiving grace, highlighting the obligation that comes from works as opposed to the free gift of grace. The Greek word 'λογίζεται' suggests a reckoning or accounting, while 'μισθὸς' implies a reward or payment. Therefore, this translation seeks to convey the legal and financial implications of the original text.|
|ROM 4:5|But to the one who does not work but believes in Him who justifies the ungodly, his faith is counted as righteousness.|This verse emphasizes the distinction between faith and works in the context of justification. The focus is on the act of believing in God who justifies the ungodly, and how that faith is counted as righteousness, not through any works we can perform.|
|ROM 4:6|Just as David also speaks of the blessing of the one to whom God counts righteousness apart from works:|This translation emphasizes the idea of divine accounting of righteousness apart from human works, aligning with David's words in the Psalms, and highlights the blessedness of such a state before God.|
|ROM 4:7|Blessed are those whose lawless deeds are forgiven, and whose sins are covered.|This translation captures the essence of Paul's teaching on the blessedness of those whose sins are forgiven. The use of the word 'blessed' reflects a state of spiritual joy and favor, highlighting the grace of God in the act of forgiveness. The terms 'transgressions' and 'sins' are kept consistent with the original text to maintain theological accuracy and clarity.|
|ROM 4:8|Blessed is the man whom the Lord will not reckon as guilty of sin.|This verse highlights the theme of divine blessing linked to the forgiveness of sin. The term 'blessed' reflects a state of divine favor, while 'the Lord' signifies God's authority in matters of righteousness. The phrase 'will not count' emphasizes the idea that God chooses not to attribute sin to the individual, which is a central theme in Pauline theology.|
|ROM 4:9|Is this blessing then only for the circumcised, or also for the uncircumcised? For we say that faith was credited to Abraham as righteousness.|In this verse, Paul raises the question of whether the blessing of righteousness through faith applies only to those who are circumcised (Jews) or also to the uncircumcised (Gentiles). The focus is on Abraham's faith, which was credited to him as righteousness, demonstrating that faith, not the law or circumcision, is the key to justification.|
|ROM 4:10|How then was it credited? Was it before or after he had been circumcised? It was not after, but before he was circumcised.|The terms 'circumcision' and 'uncircumcision' denote the Jewish and Gentile contexts, respectively. This verse emphasizes the concept of faith as the key to righteousness, irrespective of one's ethnic or religious background.|
|ROM 4:11|And he received a sign of circumcision, a seal of the righteousness of the faith which he had while uncircumcised, so that he might be the father of all who believe, though they are uncircumcised, so that righteousness might be credited to them as well.|This verse emphasizes that Abraham's circumcision was a sign of the righteousness he had through faith, prior to the act of circumcision. The term 'father of all believers' indicates his role in the faith of both circumcised and uncircumcised individuals. The word 'righteousness' signifies a right standing with God, which is obtained through faith and not through works of the law.|
|ROM 4:12|and he is also the father of the circumcised who are not only circumcised but also walk in the footsteps of the faith that our father Abraham had while he was still uncircumcised.|This verse emphasizes Abraham's role as a spiritual father to both Jews (circumcised) and Gentiles (uncircumcised) who follow in the footsteps of his faith. The term 'father of circumcision' highlights Abraham's significance in the covenant community, while the inclusion of those who walk in faith emphasizes the universality of God's promise.|
|ROM 4:13|For the promise to Abraham or to his offspring that he would be the heir of the world did not come through the law, but through the righteousness of faith.|This translation emphasizes that the promise made to Abraham is based on faith and righteousness, rather than adherence to the law. The term 'heir' is used in the context of receiving blessings and inheritance from God.|
|ROM 4:14|For if those who are of the law are heirs, then faith is made void, and the promise is rendered powerless.|In this verse, the concept of inheritance is closely tied to the principles of faith versus the law. Here, Paul emphasizes that if the heirs are defined by the law, then the essence of faith is rendered void and the promise made to Abraham is ineffective. The translation aims to maintain the balance of these theological points while conveying clarity.|
|ROM 4:15|For the law brings about wrath; but where there is no law, there is no transgression.|In this translation, 'the law' refers to the Mosaic Law which incites sin, leading to God's wrath. The terms 'wrath' and 'transgression' have been carefully chosen to reflect the gravity of the consequence of sin in relation to the law's requirements.|
|ROM 4:16|Therefore, it is from faith, so that it may be by grace, in order that the promise may rest on sure ground for all of Abraham's descendants, not only for those who are of the law but also for those who share the faith of Abraham, who is the father of us all.|This translation emphasizes the key concepts of faith, grace, and the certainty of God's promises to all who believe, extending beyond just the Jewish people to include Gentiles. It maintains the original intent of the passage while using contemporary language for clarity.|
|ROM 4:17|As it is written: "I have made you the father of many nations," in the presence of the God in whom he believed, who gives life to the dead and calls into existence the things that do not exist.|In this verse, the emphasis is on God's creative power to call forth life from death and to declare what does not exist as if it does. This highlights the theme of faith in God's promises and His ability to fulfill them against all odds, as demonstrated through Abraham's example. The phrase 'the God who gives life to the dead' captures the essence of divine intervention and hope.|
|ROM 4:18|In hope against hope, he believed, so that he would become the father of many nations, as it had been said to him: ‘So shall your offspring be.’|In this verse, the concept of hope plays a crucial role, reflecting Abraham's belief against all odds. The phrase 'against hope' signifies that Abraham's faith transcended what was logically possible, trusting fully in God's promises. The term 'father of many nations' highlights the fulfillment of God's covenant with Abraham, emphasizing both his role and the expansive nature of his legacy. The reference to his seed ('σπέρμα') speaks to the continuity of God's promises through Abraham's descendants.|
|ROM 4:19|And without being weak in faith, he did not consider his own body, already dead, since he was about a hundred years old, nor the deadness of Sarah's womb.|In this verse, the term 'did not weaken in faith' indicates a steadfastness in belief despite physical limitations. The phrase 'his own body' refers to Abraham's old age and inability to conceive, while 'the deadness of Sarah's womb' emphasizes her barrenness. The translation maintains the original meaning while ensuring clarity and understanding for the modern reader.|
|ROM 4:20|He did not waver in unbelief regarding the promise of God, but was strengthened in his faith, giving glory to God.|In this verse, the key terms revolve around faith, promise, and God's glory. The Greek term ‘διεκρίθη’ implies a judgment or differentiation, contrasting faith and disbelief. The term ‘ἐνεδυναμώθη’ denotes a strengthening of faith, which is central to Abraham's character. The translation aims to capture the essence of unwavering faith in the face of doubt.|
|ROM 4:21|and being fully convinced that God was able to do what He had promised.|The Greek word 'δυνατός' (dunatos) emphasizes the power or ability of God to fulfill His promises. The term 'ἐπήγγελται' (epēngeltai) relates to the assurances made by God. This translation conveys both the certainty of God's promise and His capability to accomplish it.|
|ROM 4:22|Therefore, his faith was credited to him as righteousness.|The phrase 'it was counted' reflects the accounting metaphor of imputation, indicating that Abraham's faith was recognized as righteousness before God. The focus is on God's gracious response to faith rather than any works of the law.|
|ROM 4:23|Now it was not written for his sake alone that it was credited to him,|This verse emphasizes that the accounting of faith as righteousness is not limited to Abraham alone, but serves as a principle applicable to all believers.|
|ROM 4:24|but also for us, to whom God will credit righteousness—for us who believe in Him who raised Jesus our Lord from the dead.|In this verse, the emphasis is on the faith of believers in the one who raised Jesus from the dead, which is central to the concept of justification. The phrase 'to be counted as righteousness' indicates that this faith leads to being reckoned righteous before God, linking back to Abraham's faith.|
|ROM 4:25|He was delivered over because of our transgressions, and He was raised for our justification.|This verse emphasizes both the significance of Christ's death due to our sins and His resurrection for our justification. The use of 'delivered up' signifies Christ's sacrifice, while 'raised' underscores the victorious nature of His resurrection, leading to our justification.|
