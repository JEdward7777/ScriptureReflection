| Reference | Verse | Translation Notes |
|:---------:|-------|-------------------|
|ROM 7:1|Or do you not know, brothers? For I am speaking to those who understand the law, that the law has authority over a person only as long as he is alive.|This verse addresses the understanding of the law's authority over a person, highlighting that it only governs as long as the person is alive. The phrase 'the law governs a person' captures the essence of its authority, while 'as long as he lives' indicates the temporal aspect of this relationship. This reflects the teaching that death alters the relationship one has with the law.|
|ROM 7:2|For the married woman is bound by the law to her living husband; but if her husband dies, she is released from the law concerning her husband.|This verse underscores the binding nature of marriage under the law and illustrates that death severs this binding relationship, freeing the widow from the obligation to her deceased husband.|
|ROM 7:3|So then, while her husband is alive, she shall be called an adulteress if she becomes united to another man; but if her husband dies, she is free from that law, so that she is not an adulteress if she marries another man.|This verse emphasizes the legal status of a married woman in relation to her husband and the implications of his death on her marital status, focusing on the freedom she gains from the law in such a case.|
|ROM 7:4|So, my brothers, you also have died to the law through the body of Christ, so that you may belong to another, to Him who was raised from the dead, in order that we may bear fruit for God.|In this verse, Paul illustrates the concept of believers' death to the law through the body of Christ. This signifies a radical transformation in their relationship with the law, where they now belong to Christ, who has been resurrected. The emphasis is on being fruitful in service to God, emphasizing the shift from a life bound by the law to one of grace and spiritual productivity.|
|ROM 7:5|For when we were in the flesh, the passions of sins worked through the law in our members to bring forth fruit for death.|In this verse, Paul contrasts the state of being in the flesh with the transformative power of Christ's sacrifice. The term 'passions of sins' implies a struggle with sinful desires that are intensified by the law. The use of 'members' here denotes our physical being, while 'bear fruit' aligns with the overall theme of the Christian life producing good works in response to God's grace. This translation emphasizes the nature of human weakness and the resulting death that sin brings when lived apart from Christ.|
|ROM 7:6|But now we have been released from the law, having died to that which held us captive, so that we serve in the newness of the Spirit and not in the oldness of the letter.|In this verse, Paul emphasizes the transformative power of Christ’s sacrifice which frees believers from the law’s hold. The phrases 'newness of spirit' and 'oldness of letter' contrast the vibrant life in the Spirit against the rigid adherence to the written law. The underlying Greek suggests a radical change in status for believers, illustrating their new relationship with God through Christ.|
|ROM 7:7|What then shall we say? Is the law sin? Certainly not! Yet, I would not have known sin except through the law; for I would not have known what it is to covet if the law had not said, 'You shall not covet.'|This verse expresses the relationship between the law and sin, emphasizing that the law itself is not sin, but it reveals sin's nature and prompts awareness of it. Paul highlights that he became conscious of sin only through the law, especially through the commandment that forbids coveting.|
|ROM 7:8|But sin, taking opportunity through the commandment, produced in me all manner of evil desire. For apart from the law, sin is dead.|This verse reflects the dynamic of sin taking advantage of the commandment to provoke desires within a person, illustrating the idea that the law, while holy and good, reveals and amplifies sin's presence. The phrase 'without the law, sin is dead' suggests that sin has no power or definition in the absence of divine commandments.|
|ROM 7:9|I was once alive without the law; but when the commandment came, sin sprang to life.|In this verse, Paul reflects on the experience of living without the law, indicating that it was not until the commandment was introduced that he became aware of sin's true nature. The phrase 'sin came to life' captures the moment of realization and the subsequent awakening of sinful desires in his heart.|
|ROM 7:10|And I died, and the commandment that was meant for life was found to lead to death for me.|This translation emphasizes the contrast between the commandment, which is meant to lead to life, and the experience of death that it ironically brings about due to sin. The phrasing aims to reflect the original Greek structure while maintaining clarity for modern readers.|
|ROM 7:11|For sin, taking opportunity through the commandment, deceived me and through it killed me.|This verse highlights the deceptive nature of sin, particularly how it uses the law as a means to lead one astray and ultimately to death. The phrase 'the commandment' refers specifically to the divine instructions meant to guide us toward life, yet sin twists this intent, illustrating the spiritual struggle of a believer.|
|ROM 7:12|So then, the law is indeed holy, and the commandment is holy, just, and good.|This verse emphasizes the nature of the law as holy, just, and good, contrasting its divine qualities with human sinfulness. The terms used in the Greek, such as 'ἅγιος' (holy) and 'ἀγαθός' (good), highlight the law's moral integrity.|
|ROM 7:13|Did that which is good then become death to me? Certainly not! But it was sin, so that it might be shown to be sin, by bringing about my death through what is good, in order that sin might be exceedingly sinful through the commandment.|In this verse, Paul is emphasizing that it is not the good (the law) that leads to death but rather sin itself, which uses the good to reveal its own true nature. The structure of the Greek sentence suggests a sharp contrast, rejecting the idea that goodness can lead to death, highlighting instead the deceptive and destructive power of sin when juxtaposed with divine commandments.|
|ROM 7:14|For we know that the Law is spiritual; but I am carnal, sold under sin.|In this verse, Paul contrasts the spiritual nature of the Law with his own condition of being sold into sin. The phrase 'sold under sin' indicates a loss of freedom to sin, emphasizing the struggle between the spiritual and the carnal aspects of human nature. The translation aims to reflect both the theological significance and the emotional weight of the struggle Paul describes.|
|ROM 7:15|For what I am doing, I do not understand; for I do not do what I want, but I do the very thing I hate.|This translation reflects the internal conflict Paul describes regarding his actions and desires, emphasizing the struggle between will and action in the context of sin and morality.|
|ROM 7:16|But if I do what I do not want, I agree with the law that it is good.|In this verse, Paul acknowledges the inner conflict between his desires and actions. The term ' σύμφημι ' (I agree) emphasizes his recognition of the goodness of God's law, even while he struggles with sin.|
|ROM 7:17|So now, it is no longer I who am doing it, but the sin that dwells in me.|This verse highlights the internal struggle between the believer's intentions and the presence of sin within. The phrase 'the sin that dwells in me' emphasizes the reality of sin's influence over the believer, while the use of 'I am no longer the one doing it' indicates a distinction between the believer's true self and the sin that operates within.|
|ROM 7:18|For I know that nothing good dwells in me, that is, in my flesh. For I have the desire to do what is good, but I cannot carry it out.|This verse reflects Paul's struggle with sin and the dichotomy between desire and action within human nature. The term 'good' relates to the inherent desire for righteousness, while 'flesh' represents the sinful nature that impedes the realization of that good.|
|ROM 7:19|For I do not do the good I want, but the evil I do not want is what I keep doing.|This verse highlights the inner conflict between the desire to do good and the actions that contradict that desire, reflecting the struggle inherent in human nature and the impact of sin on one's will.|
|ROM 7:20|Now if I do what I do not want, it is no longer I who do it, but sin dwelling in me.|This verse emphasizes the struggle between the believer's will and the indwelling sin that acts contrary to that will. The wording is kept simple to highlight the internal conflict Paul describes.|
|ROM 7:21|So, I find this principle at work: when I want to do good, evil lies close at hand.|This translation focuses on capturing the struggle between the desire to do good and the opposing force of sin. The use of 'law' refers to the principle or governing force in Paul's argument about morality.|
|ROM 7:22|For I delight in the law of God in my inner being.|In this verse, Paul expresses an internal affirmation of God's law within his inner self, despite the struggle with sin. The term 'the law of God' refers to the divine standard of righteousness, while 'the inner man' denotes the true spiritual identity of a believer, emphasizing the conflict between spiritual desire and sinful nature.|
|ROM 7:23|But I see another law at work in my members, waging war against the law of my mind and taking me captive to the law of sin that dwells in my members.|This verse reflects the inner conflict of a believer between the desire to follow God's law and the pull of sin. The contrast is drawn between the law of the mind and the law of sin, which are at odds with each other.|
|ROM 7:24|What a wretched man I am! Who will rescue me from this body that is subject to death?|In this verse, Paul expresses deep despair over the struggle against sin and the human condition. The word 'Ταλαίπωρος' (wretched) reflects a profound sense of helplessness. The phrase 'σώματος τοῦ θανάτου' (body of this death) signifies the inevitable consequence of sin—spiritual death and separation from God. The translation aims to convey both the emotional weight and theological implications of the struggle between the flesh and the spirit.|
|ROM 7:25|Thanks be to God through Jesus Christ our Lord! So then, I myself in my mind am a servant of God’s law, but in my flesh a servant of the law of sin.|In this verse, Paul expresses gratitude to God through Jesus Christ for the deliverance from the struggle between the mind and the flesh. The distinction between the mind serving God's law and the flesh serving sin is crucial, reflecting the dual nature of the believer's experience.|
