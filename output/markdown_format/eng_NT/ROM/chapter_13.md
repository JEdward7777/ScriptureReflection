| Reference | Verse | Translation Notes |
|:---------:|-------|-------------------|
|ROM 13:1|Let every person be subject to the governing authorities. For there is no authority except from God, and those that exist have been instituted by God.|The verse emphasizes the importance of submitting to governing authorities as ordained by God. The term 'exousia' is consistently understood as authority, and the context suggests that these authorities are established with divine purpose. The phrase 'under God' is crucial, signifying that all earthly power is derived from the divine.|
|ROM 13:2|Therefore, whoever resists the authority has opposed the ordinance of God, and those who have opposed will receive judgment upon themselves.|This translation aims to preserve the original meaning while rendering it into clear contemporary English. The phrases 'resists the authority' and 'will incur judgment' are articulated to reflect the consequence of opposing divine order.|
|ROM 13:3|For rulers are not a terror to good conduct, but to evil. Do you wish to be unafraid of authority? Then do what is good, and you will receive praise from it.|This verse emphasizes the role of governing authorities as instruments for maintaining order and rewarding good behavior, reflecting the biblical principle that obedience to good is expected from the people, while evildoers should have reason to fear the rulers.|
|ROM 13:4|For he is God's servant to you for good. But if you do evil, be afraid; for he does not bear the sword in vain. He is God's servant, an avenger to bring wrath on the one who practices evil.|This verse emphasizes the role of governing authorities as ministers of God for both good and punishment of wrongdoing. The imagery of the sword represents the authority's power to execute justice, and the mention of God's wrath serves as a solemn reminder of the consequences of evil actions.|
|ROM 13:5|Therefore, it is necessary to be in submission, not only because of wrath but also for the sake of conscience.|This verse emphasizes the necessity of submission to governing authorities, not only out of fear of punishment but also for the sake of maintaining a clear conscience. The words 'submission' and 'conscience' are central to the meaning of this verse, as it speaks to the believer's duty to uphold social order as ordained by God.|
|ROM 13:6|For because of this you also pay taxes, for the authorities are ministers of God, attending to this very thing.|The term 'functionaries' in the original Greek text refers to those in authority who serve a divine purpose. The emphasis here is on the obligation of citizens to fulfill their duties towards the government as a form of service to God, reflecting a theme of respect for authority in scripture.|
|ROM 13:7|Render therefore to all what is owed to them: taxes to whom taxes are due, customs to whom customs, fear to whom fear, honor to whom honor.|This verse emphasizes the importance of fulfilling our obligations, both to governing authorities and to God, by rendering what is due to each. The repetition of the word 'honor' (τιμήν) highlights the reverence and respect we should show towards those in authority and the duties we owe them. The structure of the verse reflects a systematic approach to obligations: taxes to the state and respect to individuals.|
|ROM 13:8|Owe no one anything, except to love one another. For he who loves another has fulfilled the law.|This translation emphasizes the importance of love as a fulfilling principle of the law. The word 'owe' is a direct reflection of the original Greek, and 'love one another' is highlighted as the essential command that fulfills the law.|
|ROM 13:9|For the commandments, "You shall not commit adultery," "You shall not murder," "You shall not steal," and "You shall not covet," and any other commandment, are summed up in this saying: "You shall love your neighbor as yourself."|This translation captures the essence of the original Greek text, emphasizing the summary nature of the commandments in relation to love for others. The term 'summarizes' conveys the idea of bringing together the commandments under the principle of love, while maintaining fidelity to the original language.|
|ROM 13:10|Love does no harm to a neighbor. Therefore, love is the fulfillment of the law.|This verse emphasizes that love for one's neighbor is not only a principle but also a summation of the law, indicating that true love does not harm others. The phrase 'love does no harm' directly conveys the essence of love's active nature in community relationships.|
|ROM 13:11|And this, knowing the time, that it is already high time for us to awaken from sleep; for now our salvation is nearer than when we first believed.|This verse emphasizes the urgency of awakening from spiritual slumber, indicating that the time for action and vigilance is now, particularly in light of the imminent salvation believers have in Christ. The language reflects the need for an active faith and readiness, mirroring the call to live righteously and in love.|
|ROM 13:12|The night is nearly over; the day is at hand. Therefore, let us cast off the deeds of darkness and put on the armor of light.|In this verse, Paul uses the imagery of night and day to symbolize the spiritual state of believers. 'Night' represents ignorance and sin, while 'day' signifies knowledge and righteousness. The exhortation to 'cast off the works of darkness' indicates a decisive action against sinful behavior, while 'putting on the armor of light' suggests adopting a lifestyle that reflects the character of Christ and His teachings. The metaphor of armor aligns with Paul's broader theme of spiritual readiness and protection found in other parts of his letters.|
|ROM 13:13|Let us walk honorably, as in the day, not in carousing and drunkenness, not in sexual immorality and debauchery, not in strife and envy.|In this verse, Paul calls for a lifestyle that reflects the coming of the day of the Lord. The contrasting behaviors he mentions (such as revelry, drunkenness, sexual immorality, and discord) highlight the moral standards expected of believers in anticipation of Christ's return. The use of 'honorably' (εὐσχημόνως) indicates a call for proper conduct in public life, in direct opposition to shameful behaviors.|
|ROM 13:14|But put on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make no provision for the flesh to fulfill its lusts.|The command to 'put on' Christ signifies an active choice to embody His character and attributes, while the warning against provision for the flesh emphasizes the importance of resisting sinful desires that lead to corruption.|
