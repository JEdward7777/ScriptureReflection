This translation seeks to encapsulate the severity and nature of the trials that will characterize the latter days, making it relevant to the reader's understanding of current societal challenges.|

|2TI 3:6|For among them are those who creep into households and captivate weak women, burdened with sins and led by various desires.|This verse highlights the manipulative behavior of certain individuals who exploit vulnerable women, emphasizing the influence of sin and various desires that drive such actions.

|2TI 3:7|Always seeking knowledge, but never able to arrive at the full understanding of the truth.|The phrase 'always learning' suggests a continuous effort to acquire knowledge, while 'never able to come to the knowledge of the truth' indicates a profound lack of understanding despite this effort. This captures the essence of being exposed to information without grasping its true significance.|
|2TI 3:8|Just as Janes and Jambres opposed Moses, so also these men oppose the truth; they are men of depraved minds, unfit for faith.|The names Janes and Jambres are believed to refer to the Egyptian magicians who opposed Moses during the plagues. The passage illustrates the opposition to the truth of God by individuals whose minds are corrupted and who are unfit concerning the faith.

Yet the Lord delivered me from them all.|This verse emphasizes Paul's personal experience of persecution and suffering for the sake of the gospel, highlighting the faithfulness of the Lord in delivering him from these trials. It draws a parallel between the believer's experiences and the endurance that can be derived from God's faithfulness in similar circumstances.|
|2TI 3:12|Indeed, all who wish to lead a life of godliness in Christ Jesus will be persecuted.|The phrase 'all who desire to live godly' is rendered as 'those wishing to lead a life of godliness,' emphasizing intentionality in one's faith.

|2TI 3:13|But wicked men and deceivers will progress from bad to worse, deceiving and being deceived.|The phrase 'evil people and impostors' is translated as 'wicked men and deceivers', emphasizing their malicious intent and deceptive practices. The verb 'will go from bad to worse' conveys the progression of their corrupting influence. This verse highlights the characteristics of individuals who lead others astray, reflecting the nature of spiritual deception in the last days.|
|2TI 3:14|But you must continue in the things you have learned and have been assured of, knowing from whom you learned them.|This verse emphasizes the importance of steadfastness in the teachings learned from trusted sources.

|2TI 3:15|and that from childhood you have known the sacred Scriptures, which are able to make you wise for salvation through faith in Christ Jesus.|This verse emphasizes the importance of Scripture from an early age and its role in guiding one toward salvation through faith in Jesus Christ.
