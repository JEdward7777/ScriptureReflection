|PHM 1:3|Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.|This verse follows a common Pauline greeting structure, emphasizing the importance of grace and peace originating from God the Father and Jesus Christ. The specific terms 'grace' (χάρις) and 'peace' (εἰρήνη) are central themes in Pauline letters, signifying God's favor and the well-being of believers.|

|PHM 1:8|Therefore, although I have great boldness in Christ to command you what is fitting,|The phrase 'having great boldness in Christ' emphasizes a confident authority grounded in Christ. The term 'to command' reflects the pastoral relationship and love that Paul has for Philemon. This command is framed in love and relationship rather than mere authority.|
|PHM 1:9|Yet, I appeal to you instead on the basis of love, being such a one as Paul, an elder and now also a prisoner of Christ Jesus.|This verse emphasizes the Apostle Paul's appeal to Philemon not just based on his authority, but through love and personal relationship, given that he identifies himself as an elder and a prisoner of Christ.

|PHM 1:10|I appeal to you for my child, whom I have begotten in my chains, Onesimus,|In this verse, Paul is addressing Philemon regarding his 'child' Onesimus, who he refers to as his son in the faith.

This shift from uselessness to usefulness highlights the transformative power of Christ in an individual's life, as well as the relational dynamics between Paul, Philemon, and Onesimus.|
|PHM 1:12|I am sending him back to you, this is my own heart.|In this verse, Paul uses the term "splanchnon" (σπλάγχνα) to express deep emotional concern, often translated as 'heartfelt compassion' or 'inner feelings'.

The phrase 'to serve you' (διακονῇ μοι ἐν τοῖς δεσμοῖς) signifies a call to ministry even amidst Paul's imprisonment.|

|PHM 1:15|For perhaps it was for this reason that he was separated from you for a while, so that you might receive him back forever.|The phrase 'διὰ τοῦτο' can be translated as 'for this reason' and reflects the notion of purpose or intention. 'ἔχωρίσθη' suggests a temporary separation or distancing, which is critical in understanding the intention behind Onesimus' departure.

|PHM 1:17|If you consider me a partner, welcome him as you would welcome me.|This verse highlights the call to treat Onesimus as a fellow partner in faith and in the community of believers. The term 'koinonon' signifies a deep fellowship and mutual responsibility that goes beyond mere association.|

|PHM 1:19|I, Paul, write this with my own hand: I will repay it. To say nothing of your owing me even your own self.|In this verse, Paul asserts his personal commitment to repay whatever Philemon's runaway slave owes him.

|PHM 1:20|Yes, brother, I desire to have joy from you in the Lord; refresh my heart in Christ.|In this verse, Paul expresses a deep emotional connection to Philemon, asking him to refresh his heart. The Greek word 'σπλάγχνα' indicates deep feelings of compassion and affection. The phrase 'ἀναπαυσόν μου τὰ σπλάγχνα' suggests a request for emotional rejuvenation or comfort in the context of their relationship in Christ.
