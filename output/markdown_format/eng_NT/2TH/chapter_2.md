|2TH 2:1|Now we beseech you, brothers, concerning the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ and our gathering together to Him,|This translation captures the urgency and relational aspect of the exhortation regarding the Lord's coming and the gathering of believers. The term 'presence' is central, reflecting both the event of Christ's return and the assembly of His followers.|
|2TH 2:2|that you not be quickly shaken in mind or troubled, either by spirit, or by word, or by letter, as if from us, as though the day of Christ had already come.|In this verse, the Apostle Paul is urging the believers not to be easily shaken in mind or spirit. The words used reflect a call for stability and reassurance in the face of confusion regarding the return of Christ. The phrase 'the day of Christ' refers to the anticipated second coming of Christ, emphasizing that believers should remain firm in their faith despite any distressing claims or reports they may hear.|
|2TH 2:3|Let no one deceive you by any means; for that day will not come unless the apostasy comes first, and the man of sin is revealed, the son of perdition.|This translation emphasizes the concepts of deception and the necessity of recognizing the signs that must precede the arrival of significant prophetic events. The term 'apostasy' directly refers to a falling away from the faith, while 'man of sin' indicates an individual associated with great rebellion against God.|
|2TH 2:4|He opposes and exalts himself above all that is called God or that is worshiped, so that he sits as God in the temple of God, showing himself as if he were God.|This verse describes the adversary's boldness and self-exaltation, as well as his attempt to take God's place in the temple, proclaiming himself as God. The language reflects a strong emphasis on blasphemy and idolatry.|
|2TH 2:5|Do you not remember that while I was still with you, I told you these things?|In this verse, Paul reminds the Thessalonian church of his previous teachings while he was with them. The verb used here implies an expectation that they should have retained these teachings. This reflects the importance of memory and teaching in the early Christian community, reinforcing the notion that previous instruction holds significance for understanding present situations.|
|2TH 2:6|And now you know what is restraining him, so that he may be revealed in his own time.|In this verse, the term 'that which restrains' refers to a force or entity holding back a future revelation of the lawless one. The phrase 'in its own time' suggests a divine timetable for this revelation, emphasizing God's sovereignty over historical events.|
|2TH 2:7|For the mystery of lawlessness is already at work; only he who now holds it back will continue until he is taken out of the way.|The term 'mystery' (μυστήριον) is used here in the sense of divine truth that was previously hidden but is now being revealed. The phrase 'the one who restrains' (ὁ κατέχων) indicates a force or entity currently preventing the full manifestation of lawlessness. The original text suggests that this restraint will continue until a certain time.|
|2TH 2:8|And then the lawless one will be revealed, whom the Lord Jesus will destroy with the breath of His mouth and bring to nothing by the appearing of His coming.|This verse discusses the revealing of the lawless one, who will ultimately be destroyed by the Lord. The phrase 'the lawless one' (ὁ ἄνομος) emphasizes rebellion against God's laws, a theme echoed in other scriptures. The Lord's victory over this figure is depicted as both an act of judgment and a demonstration of His sovereign authority, aligning with biblical themes of divine justice and the eventual triumph over evil.|
|2TH 2:9|The coming of the lawless one will be by the working of Satan, accompanied by all power and signs and false wonders.|This verse highlights the deceptive nature of the manifestations attributed to the 'lawless one,' emphasizing the use of power, signs, and wonders that are rooted in falsehood. The Greek word 'ἐνέργειαν' (energy) points to an active force, while 'δυνάμει' (power), 'σημείοις' (signs), and 'τέρασι' (wonders) suggest a miraculous but misleading display meant to deceive.|

|2TH 2:11|Therefore, God will send them a strong delusion, so that they may believe what is false.|This verse speaks of God sending a strong delusion to those who do not believe the truth. The focus is on the divine action that leads individuals to accept falsehoods as a result of their refusal to embrace the truth. The word 'energy' in the original Greek conveys a sense of active force, indicating that this delusion is not passive but a powerful influence.|
|2TH 2:12|so that all may be condemned who did not believe the truth but took pleasure in unrighteousness.|This verse highlights the fate of those who choose not to believe in the truth, specifically referring to their condemnation and the consequences of their choice. The wording is crafted to reflect the seriousness of rejecting divine truth while using terms that resonate with the larger biblical narrative.|

The phrase 'peripoīsis doxās' translates to 'a obtaining of glory', denoting a specific future hope that stems from God's initiative in calling His people through the gospel. It reflects the overall theme of divine election and sanctification seen throughout the New Testament.|
