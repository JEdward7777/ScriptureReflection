It asserts that true wisdom is intended for those who are mature in their faith.|
|1CO 2:7|But we speak of God’s wisdom in a hidden mystery, the wisdom that was concealed, which God predetermined before the ages for our glory.|This verse emphasizes the divine wisdom that has been hidden throughout the ages but is now revealed to believers. The term 'mystery' signifies truths that were not known until God's revelation, stressing the profound nature of God's plan for glory.|
|1CO 2:8|None of the rulers of this age understood this; for if they had known, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory.|This verse emphasizes the idea that the rulers of this age lack true understanding of God's plan, leading to the crucifixion of Christ, who is the embodiment of divine glory. The term 'rulers' can refer to both spiritual authorities and worldly leaders, highlighting their blindness to God's wisdom.|
