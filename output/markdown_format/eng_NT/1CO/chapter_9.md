|:---------:|-------|-------------------|
|1CO 9:1|Am I not an apostle? Am I not free? Have I not seen Jesus Christ our Lord? Are not you my work in the Lord?|In this verse, Paul defends his authority as an apostle. The questions posed reflect his confidence in his mission and the personal relationship he has with Jesus Christ. The use of 'free' indicates not just freedom from law but freedom in Christ, which is an important theme in his writings. The connection to the Corinthians as his 'work' emphasizes the role of the community in affirming his apostolic calling.|
|1CO 9:2|If I am not an apostle to others, surely I am to you; for you are the seal of my apostleship in the Lord.|In this verse, Paul asserts his apostolic authority, emphasizing that even if he is not regarded as an apostle by others, his status as such is confirmed by the believers he has led to Christ. The 'seal' or 'mark' of his apostleship is the community of believers themselves, which illustrates the relational aspect of apostolic ministry. This fresh translation focuses on the clarity and directness of Paul's claim, utilizing accessible modern English while maintaining the original intent of the text.|
|1CO 9:3|This is my defense to those who examine me.|In this verse, the Apostle Paul emphasizes the nature of his defense (apologia) in response to those questioning his authority and credibility. The term 'ἀπολογία' refers to a formal defense or reasoned argument, reflecting Paul’s intention to provide justification for his apostolic ministry.|
|1CO 9:4|Do we not have the right to eat and drink?|In this verse, the Apostle Paul is affirming his right, as an apostle, to receive sustenance from his ministry. The terms 'exousia' (authority) and the emphasis on eating and drinking highlight the privileges that come with serving in the Gospel. This translation aims to maintain the original Greek's intent and nuance while conveying its meaning clearly in contemporary English.|
|1CO 9:5|Do we not have the right to lead about a believing wife, as do the other apostles and the brothers of the Lord and Cephas?|In this verse, Paul is asserting his right to marry, similar to how other apostles and prominent Christian figures do. The term 'sister' emphasizes the spiritual kinship that Christians have, implying that he speaks of a Christian woman as a partner. The use of 'authority' reflects the broader discussion of rights within the Christian community.|
|1CO 9:6|Or do only I and Barnabas not have the right to refrain from working?|This verse emphasizes the authority and rights of the apostles, specifically addressing the ability to abstain from secular work as they preach the Gospel. It highlights the distinction made by Paul and Barnabas concerning their role in ministry compared to others who may choose a different path.|
|1CO 9:7|Who serves as a soldier at his own expense? Who plants a vineyard and does not eat of its fruit? Or who shepherds a flock and does not drink from the milk of the flock?|This verse emphasizes the principle that those who labor in a certain field have a right to partake of the benefits of their work, using metaphors related to military service, agriculture, and pastoral care to illustrate the point.|
|1CO 9:8|Am I speaking these things merely from a human perspective? Or does not the Law also say the same?|In this verse, Paul is emphasizing that his words are not mere human arguments, but rather that they align with God's law, which supports the principle of compensation for labor. The rhetorical question is designed to prompt reflection on the fairness and justice of divine law, drawing attention to the connection between earthly principles and spiritual truths.|
|1CO 9:9|For it is written in the law of Moses: 'You shall not muzzle an ox while it is treading out the grain.' Is God concerned only for oxen?|In this verse, Paul references a principle from the Mosaic Law that highlights God's concern not only for human laborers but also for animals that serve them. The translation emphasizes the rhetorical nature of the question, suggesting that God's concern extends beyond the immediate context of the law to the broader principle of justice and care for those who labor.|
|1CO 9:10|Or does he speak entirely for our sake? It was for our sake that this was written, that he who plows should plow in hope, and he who threshes in hope should be partaker of that hope.|This verse draws on the agricultural metaphor to communicate the principle of providing for those who serve in ministry. Paul emphasizes that the instruction given is not solely for animals but is fundamentally applicable to human laborers in God's service.|
|1CO 9:11|If we have sown spiritual things among you, is it too much if we reap material things from you?|In this verse, the Apostle Paul contrasts the spiritual contributions he and his fellow workers have made to the church with the material support they might receive in return. The original Greek emphasizes the notion of sowing spiritual things and reaping material benefits, highlighting the expectation of mutual support within the body of Christ.|
|1CO 9:12|If others share in this right of ours, should we not have even more? Yet we have not made use of this right. Instead, we endure all things so that we may not hinder the gospel of Christ.|This verse emphasizes the Apostle Paul's right to receive support for his ministry while also showing his restraint in exercising that right. The phrase 'but we did not make use of this right' indicates a conscious choice not to burden the believers for the sake of the gospel.|

The use of 'holy things' and 'the altar' connects back to the practices established in the Old Testament concerning the support of the priests. The cultural context of the Corinthian church also adds a layer of understanding regarding the support of those who minister the gospel.|
|1CO 9:14|In the same way, the Lord has commanded that those who proclaim the gospel should earn their living by the gospel.|This verse emphasizes the principle that those who preach the gospel are entitled to support from the community they serve. The wording is crafted to maintain the original meaning while ensuring clarity and relevance to the contemporary reader.|

And I am not writing this to secure any such provision; for I would rather die than have anyone deprive me of my reason to boast.|This verse expresses Paul's reluctance to rely on financial support and highlights the importance he places on maintaining his integrity and mission. The phrase about his willingness to die rather than have his boast undermined conveys the depth of his commitment to the gospel.|

Woe to me if I do not preach the gospel!|In this verse, Paul expresses the necessity he feels to preach the gospel and the urgency of this calling. The phrase 'I have no reason to boast' reflects his view of preaching as a divine obligation rather than a personal achievement. This highlights the serious nature of the commission he has received from God, underscoring the weight of responsibility he bears in sharing the message of Christ.|
|1CO 9:17|For if I do this willingly, I have a reward; but if against my will, I am entrusted with a stewardship.|The original Greek text emphasizes the dual nature of Paul's service in preaching the gospel: the voluntary aspect ('if I do this willingly') versus the compulsion he feels ('if not willingly'). This reflects his commitment and the role of stewardship he assumes in the ministry.|
|1CO 9:18|What then is my reward? That when I preach the gospel, I may present it without charge, so as not to misuse my authority in the gospel of Christ.|In this verse, Paul expresses his desire to preach the gospel without charge, emphasizing the purity of his motives and the importance of not misusing his authority.

The focus is on his mission to win more souls for Christ, emphasizing the idea of becoming like those he serves without compromising his principles.|

The phrase 'to the Jews I became as a Jew' reflects Paul's strategic approach to evangelism, showcasing his understanding of cultural contexts in preaching the Gospel.|
|1CO 9:21|To those outside the law, I became as one outside the law—though I am not without the law of God, but under the law of Christ—so that I might win those outside the law.|In this verse, Paul illustrates his adaptability in preaching the gospel. He emphasizes that although he does not violate God's law, he aligns himself with others who may not be governed by the same standards in order to effectively communicate the message of Christ and lead them to faith. The use of the term 'lawless' reflects the cultural and spiritual diversity of his audience, while 'lawful in Christ' indicates his commitment to the teachings of Jesus as a guiding principle in his actions.|
|1CO 9:22|To the weak, I became weak, that I might win the weak; I have become all things to all people, so that by all means I might save some.|In this verse, Paul expresses his deep commitment to evangelism by adapting his approach based on the needs of those he encounters. The term 'weak' (ἀσθενέσιν) implies not just physical weakness but also spiritual and social weaknesses, indicating his willingness to empathize and engage with those who are marginalized or struggling. This translation aims to reflect that adaptability and compassion, which are core aspects of Paul's ministry.|
|1CO 9:23|I do all this for the sake of the gospel, that I may become a partaker of it with others.|In this verse, Paul emphasizes his commitment to the gospel, indicating that his actions are motivated by the desire to participate in the sharing of the good news with others.

|1CO 9:24|Do you not know that those who run in a race all run, but one receives the prize? Run in such a way that you may obtain it.|In this verse, Paul uses the metaphor of running a race to encourage believers to strive for the ultimate prize in their spiritual life. The imagery of competition is significant in conveying the dedication required to attain the heavenly reward. The phrase 'run in such a way as to obtain it' suggests an active, purposeful pursuit of the Christian calling, akin to that of an athlete disciplined in their training.|
|1CO 9:25|Every athlete exercises self-control in all things. They do it to receive a perishable crown, but we an imperishable one.|This verse emphasizes the discipline and self-control required in striving for spiritual rewards, contrasting the temporary accolades of the world with the eternal rewards from God. The term 'incorruptible crown' reflects the enduring nature of the heavenly reward as opposed to the perishable prizes of earthly competitions.|
|1CO 9:26|Therefore, I run in such a way as not without a goal; I box in such a manner as not beating the air.|In this verse, Paul uses athletic imagery to convey the intensity and purposefulness required in the Christian life. The metaphor of running is common in his writings, emphasizing discipline and intentionality in one's spiritual journey.|
|1CO 9:27|But I discipline my body and bring it into subjection, lest after preaching to others, I myself should become disqualified.|In this verse, Paul uses the metaphor of an athlete who rigorously trains to ensure that he is not disqualified from receiving the prize. The term 'bruising' or 'striking' ('ὑποπιάζω') reflects the discipline and self-control necessary for a believer's spiritual journey.
