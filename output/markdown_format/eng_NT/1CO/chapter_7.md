|1CO 7:1|Now concerning the matters you wrote about, it is good for a man not to engage intimately with a woman.|This verse addresses the topic of sexual relations and celibacy, emphasizing a specific concern regarding the conduct of men in relation to women. The choice of 'a man' highlights a particular social context where male actions towards women are under scrutiny. The phrase 'not to touch a woman' refers to engaging in intimate relations, suggesting a call to abstain from sexual activities, aligning with the earlier context of glorifying God with one's body.|

|1CO 7:3|The husband should fulfill his marital duty to his wife, and likewise the wife to her husband.|The term 'eunoiā' (ἡ ὀφειλομένην εὔνοιαν) translates to 'due benevolence' or 'conjugal rights,' implying the obligation spouses have to one another in their marital relationship. The verse emphasizes mutual responsibility and care between husbands and wives, reinforcing the concept of marital duty and affection in the context of Christian teachings.|

The importance of unity in marriage is highlighted, and the potential spiritual danger posed by lack of self-control is noted, all while staying faithful to the original Greek text.|
|1CO 7:6|But I say this as a concession, not as a command.|The phrase 'κατὰ συγγνώμην, οὐ κατ᾽ ἐπιταγήν' implies a gentle concession or allowance rather than a strict command. This reflects the apostle's intention to provide understanding in matters of marital relations, suggesting that he speaks from a place of consideration rather than legalistic authority.|
|1CO 7:7|For I wish that all people were as I am; but each has his own gift from God, one in this way and another in that.|The verse emphasizes the concept of individual spiritual gifts given by God, highlighting both the apostle Paul's personal preference for celibacy and the diversity of gifts in the Christian community. It reflects a perspective of valuing personal calling and God's unique plan for each individual.|
|1CO 7:8|To the unmarried and the widows, I say: it is good for them to remain as I am.|In this verse, Paul is addressing unmarried individuals and widows, emphasizing the value of remaining as they are, similar to his own state of singleness.

The phrase 'as I am' highlights Paul's own situation, reinforcing the encouragement for them to remain unmarried for spiritual focus.|
|1CO 7:9|But if they cannot exercise self-control, let them marry; for it is better to marry than to be consumed with passion.|This verse addresses the natural inclination of individuals to engage in sexual relations when they cannot practice self-control. The phrase 'better to marry than to burn' indicates the urgency of acting on one’s desires rather than remaining in a state of overwhelming passion.|
|1CO 7:10|To the married, I command—yet not I, but the Lord—that a wife should not separate from her husband.|In this translation, the focus is on the authoritative instruction regarding marriage and separation. The phrase 'not to be separated' is emphasized to align with the teaching of Jesus about the sanctity of marriage. The term 'husband' and 'wife' are used to reflect the biblical view of marriage roles.|
|1CO 7:11|But if she does separate, let her remain unmarried, or be reconciled to her husband; and let not a husband divorce his wife.|In this verse, the emphasis is placed on the response of a woman who may find herself separated from her husband. The apostle Paul instructs that if she is separated, she should remain unmarried or seek reconciliation with her husband. The term 'remain unmarried' is translated to capture the concept of being 'free' in the context of not remarrying, while 'be reconciled' reflects the intention of restoration in the relationship.|
|1CO 7:12|To the rest I say, not the Lord: If any brother has an unbelieving wife and she is willing to live with him, he should not divorce her.|In this verse, Paul provides guidance on the situation where a believer is married to an unbeliever.

The terms ‘sanctified’ and ‘unclean’ are key, with ‘sanctified’ indicating a state of being set apart for God, while ‘unclean’ reflects a condition that is common in the absence of faith. The assurance that the children are holy when one parent believes shows the profound impact of faith within a family unit.|

For God has called us to peace.|The verse speaks to the situation of separation between a believer and an unbeliever in a marriage.

Let him not be circumcised.|This verse emphasizes the importance of one's state at the time of calling, underscoring the notion that one's physical status (such as being circumcised or uncircumcised) should not dictate their spiritual standing or actions. The original Greek wording reflects a strong rhetorical stance against changing one's status based on societal or religious pressures.|
|1CO 7:19|For circumcision is nothing, and uncircumcision is nothing, but keeping the commandments of God is what matters.|In this verse, Paul emphasizes that outward rituals such as circumcision or uncircumcision hold no value in relation to one's standing before God. Instead, what truly matters is obedience to God's commands. This idea reflects a consistent theme in Paul's writings where he contrasts external practices with internal faith and obedience.|
|1CO 7:20|Let each person remain in the state in which he was called.|In this verse, Paul emphasizes the importance of maintaining one's current status or situation when called by God.

The focus is on belonging to the Lord regardless of physical circumstances.|
|1CO 7:23|You were bought with a price; do not become servants of men.|This verse emphasizes the value and price of redemption, urging believers not to become enslaved to worldly authority after being purchased at a great cost.

|1CO 7:24|So, brothers and sisters, let each one remain with God in the condition in which he was called.|In this verse, the Apostle Paul encourages believers to remain in the condition in which they were called. This emphasizes the idea of contentment and faithfulness in one's current situation, reflecting a theological understanding of God's sovereignty in our lives.|

The use of 'faithful' ('πιστὸς') underscores the reliability of his perspective based on his commitment to God.|

The command not to seek change reflects the emphasis on commitment and acceptance, particularly during difficult times. The wording has been carefully chosen to reflect both the literal meaning and the underlying principle of contentment and dedication.|
|1CO 7:28|But if you do marry, you have not sinned; and if a virgin marries, she has not sinned. However, those who marry will face challenges in this life, and I want to spare you that.|In this verse, Paul addresses the topic of marriage, acknowledging that marrying or remaining single are both acceptable choices. He emphasizes the practical challenges that married individuals may face, particularly in terms of emotional and physical distress.|
|1CO 7:29|This is what I mean, brothers: the time is limited. So, from now on, those who have wives should live as if they do not.|In this verse, Paul addresses the urgency of the current situation believers face, emphasizing that time is short and prioritizing spiritual matters over earthly relationships. The phrase 'the time is short' implies a pressing need for focus on eternal matters.

The unmarried man cares for the things of the Lord, how he may please the Lord.|In this verse, Paul emphasizes the state of being free from distractions and worries regarding worldly affairs, particularly in the context of serving God.

|1CO 7:33|But he who is married is anxious about the things of the world, how he may please his wife.|In this verse, the Apostle Paul contrasts the concerns of those who are married with those who are single. The phrase 'cares for the things of the world' implies a focus on earthly responsibilities, which can distract from spiritual pursuits. The term 'please' here emphasizes the importance of pleasing one’s spouse within the context of marital obligations.|
|1CO 7:34|There is a distinction between a woman and a virgin. The unmarried woman cares about the things of the Lord, that she may be holy in both body and spirit; but she who is married cares about the things of the world, how she may please her husband.|This translation emphasizes the contrasting concerns of a woman who is unmarried versus one who is married. The focus on the Lord's matters highlights a central theme of devotion in the Christian life, while also recognizing the practicalities of earthly relationships.|
|1CO 7:35|And I say this for your own benefit, not to put a restraint upon you, but for the sake of promoting good order and securing undistracted devotion to the Lord.|In this translation, I have aimed to capture the intent of Paul's words regarding the benefits of being unencumbered by marital responsibilities for the sake of serving the Lord. The word 'eagerly' reflects a spirit of intentional focus rather than mere absence of distraction. The phrases 'advantage' and 'serving the Lord' are used to convey the broader theological implications.|
|1CO 7:36|But if anyone thinks he is behaving improperly toward his virgin, if she is past the prime of life, and if it must be so, let him do what he wishes. He does not sin; let them marry.|In this verse, the Greek term 'ἀσχημονεῖν' suggests a sense of dishonor or impropriety concerning the virgin in question, indicating that there may be social or personal pressures influencing the decision to marry. The phrase 'ὑπέρακμος' literally means 'past the flower of youth,' implying that the virgin is at an age where marriage is appropriate or expected. The language conveys the idea of personal agency in deciding whether to marry, and it emphasizes that such a decision is not sinful. This fresh translation aims to reflect the nuance of these terms while maintaining clarity for contemporary readers.|
|1CO 7:37|But if someone stands firm in their heart, having no necessity but has control over their own will, and has decided this in their heart to keep his own virgin, he does well.|In this verse, the emphasis is on personal decision and the exercise of free will in matters of the heart. The words 'steadfast,' 'heart,' and 'will' are central to conveying the meaning of autonomy in the choice regarding one's virginity. The translation maintains the integrity of the original Greek while providing clarity.|
|1CO 7:38|So then, he who marries does well, but he who does not marry does even better.|The verse highlights the contrasting decisions regarding marriage. The term 'Ἐκγαμίζων' signifies one who chooses to marry, while 'μὴ ἐκγαμίζων' indicates a choice to remain single. The phrases 'καλῶς ποιεῖ' and 'κρεῖσσον ποιεῖ' underline the moral quality of each choice, suggesting that both are honorable in their own right depending on the individual's situation and calling.|

The phrase 'only in the Lord' signifies the expectation that a believer should remarry only another believer, aligning with the teachings in the New Testament regarding spiritual unity in marriage.|
|1CO 7:40|But she will be happier if she remains as she is, in my opinion; and I think that I also have the Spirit of God.|In this verse, the Apostle Paul presents a personal opinion regarding the state of a widow.
