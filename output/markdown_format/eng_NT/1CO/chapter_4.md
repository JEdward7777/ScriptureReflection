| Reference | Verse | Translation Notes |
|:---------:|-------|-------------------|
|1CO 4:1|Let a person regard us in this way: as servants of Christ and stewards of the mysteries of God.|In this translation, I focused on conveying the roles of believers as servants of Christ and stewards of God's mysteries. The Greek word 'ὑπηρέτας' (servants) emphasizes the role of service, while 'οἰκονόμους' (stewards) refers to managing or overseeing God's mysteries. The phrase 'μυστηρίων Θεοῦ' is rendered as 'mysteries of God' to reflect the depth and sacredness of the knowledge and responsibilities entrusted to believers.|
|1CO 4:2|Moreover, it is required of stewards that one be found faithful.|In this verse, the term 'stewards' (οἰκονόμοις) refers to those who manage or oversee something on behalf of another, specifically God's mysteries in the context of Christian ministry. The emphasis is on faithfulness as a key quality for those entrusted with such responsibilities.|
|1CO 4:3|As for me, it matters very little that I am judged by you or by any human court; indeed, I do not even judge myself.|In this verse, Paul emphasizes that he does not regard human judgments as authoritative over his own self-assessment. The Greek term 'ἀνακριθῶ' indicates a judicial examination, while 'ἡμέρας' refers to a day, often interpreted as a time of reckoning. Paul asserts that the evaluation he cares about comes from the Lord rather than from people.|
|1CO 4:4|For I am not aware of anything against myself; yet I am not thereby acquitted. It is the Lord who examines me.|In this verse, the Apostle Paul emphasizes the importance of divine judgment over human judgment. The phrase 'I am not aware of anything against myself' reflects a state of self-reflection, while 'but in this I am not justified' indicates that self-approval does not equate to righteousness before God. The conclusion, 'the one who examines me is the Lord,' affirms that ultimate accountability belongs to God.|
|1CO 4:5|Therefore do not judge anything before the appointed time, until the Lord comes, who will bring to light the hidden things of darkness and disclose the motives of the hearts. Then each will receive praise from God.|This verse emphasizes the importance of waiting for the Lord's return before passing judgment, as He alone has the ability to illuminate hidden truths and reveal the intentions of the heart. The translation aims to capture the urgency of refraining from premature judgment and recognizing God's ultimate authority.|
|1CO 4:6|Now, brothers, I have applied these things to myself and Apollos for your benefit, so that in us you may learn not to go beyond what is written, and that none of you may be puffed up in favor of one against another.|In this verse, Paul uses the idea of presenting a personal example through himself and Apollos to encourage humility among the Corinthians. The admonition against becoming prideful and elevating one leader over another reflects the broader context of unity within the body of Christ. The phrase 'what is written' suggests a reminder to adhere to the teachings of Scripture rather than personal biases or preferences.|
|1CO 4:7|For who regards you as superior? And what do you have that you did not receive? If you did indeed receive it, why do you boast as though you had not received it?|In this verse, the apostle Paul highlights the folly of boasting about one's own accomplishments or gifts, emphasizing that all that we have comes from God and that there is no basis for pride. The rhetorical questions underline the absurdity of such boasting, as it suggests a false sense of self-reliance.|
|1CO 4:8|Already you are filled! Already you have become rich! You have begun to reign without us—indeed, I wish you did reign, so that we might share in that reign with you!|In this verse, Paul employs a tone of irony to highlight the pride and self-sufficiency of the Corinthians. The Greek term 'κεκορεσμένοι' implies fullness or satisfaction, suggesting that they feel they have arrived or have been completed in their spiritual maturity. 'ἐπλουτήσατε' refers to the riches they believe they have attained, while 'χωρὶς ἡμῶν' indicates their independence from the apostles. The verse concludes with a pointed rhetorical question about their reigning, hinting at a desire for shared leadership, yet with an underlying critique of their attitude.|
|1CO 4:9|For I think that God has displayed us, the apostles, last of all, like those sentenced to death; for we have become a spectacle to the world, both to angels and to men.|In this verse, Paul uses the metaphor of theater to convey the perception of apostles as spectacles in a cosmic drama. The term 'theater' is particularly striking as it indicates not only public visibility but also the role of the apostles as witnesses in a greater narrative involving angels and humanity. The term 'last' signifies their perceived position of humiliation and suffering in comparison to the pride of the Corinthian believers.|
|1CO 4:10|We are regarded as fools for Christ's sake, but you are considered wise in Christ; we are weak, but you are strong; you are esteemed, but we are dishonored.|In this verse, the apostle Paul contrasts the perceived status of the apostles with that of the Corinthian believers. The use of 'fools' and 'wise', 'weak' and 'strong', as well as 'dishonored' and 'honored', highlights the reversal of worldly values in the Kingdom of God. This fresh translation aims to maintain the original meaning while expressing it in a contemporary manner.|
|1CO 4:11|To this very hour we hunger and thirst; we are poorly clothed, beaten, and homeless.|This verse highlights the sufferings faced by Paul and his companions as a reflection of their commitment to Christ. The Greek terms used convey the intensity of their physical and emotional struggles in stark contrast to the perceived status of the Corinthians. The word 'gyrnniteuomen' (naked) indicates a lack of basic necessities, while 'kolaphizometha' (beaten) suggests persecution.|
|1CO 4:12|And we labor, working with our own hands. When we are insulted, we bless; when we are persecuted, we endure.|This translation emphasizes the contrast between the hardships faced by the Apostle Paul and his response to those challenges. The use of 'working with our own hands' underscores the humility and labor involved in his ministry, while the responses to insult and persecution reflect the Christian attitude of love and endurance in the face of adversity.|
|1CO 4:13|When we are slandered, we plead for understanding; we have become like the scum of the earth, the refuse of all things, even until now.|In this verse, the apostle Paul speaks of the lowly and derided position he and the other apostles have among the world. The word ‘βλασφημούμενοι’ is significant as it conveys not only insults but also slander. The imagery of being ‘persecuted’ and yet holding a steadfast position reflects the teachings of Jesus about the Christian's attitude towards suffering and shame for the sake of the Gospel.|
|1CO 4:14|I do not write these things to shame you, but as my beloved children, I admonish you.|The phrase 'as my beloved children' emphasizes the affectionate relationship Paul has with the Corinthians, reinforcing the idea of parental guidance and correction in love. The word 'admonish' reflects a call to wisdom and growth rather than mere reprimand, in line with biblical themes of correction that aim for restoration.|
|1CO 4:15|For though you may have countless teachers in Christ, you do not have many fathers; for in Christ Jesus, through the gospel, I became your father.|In this verse, Paul distinguishes between the role of spiritual teachers and that of spiritual fathers. While many can guide the faithful, only a few can claim the role of a true father, signifying a deeper relational and spiritual commitment. The phrase 'in Christ Jesus' emphasizes the significance of the relationship formed through the Gospel.|
|1CO 4:16|Therefore, I urge you, be imitators of me.|In this verse, Paul urges the Corinthians to follow his example as he follows Christ. The term 'imitators' carries the connotation of taking on the characteristics and behaviors of someone admired. Paul emphasizes a relationship of mentorship, where he sees himself as a spiritual father guiding his children in faith.|
|1CO 4:17|For this reason, I have sent you Timothy, who is my beloved and faithful child in the Lord. He will remind you of my ways in Christ, just as I teach everywhere in every church.|In this verse, Paul sends Timothy to the Corinthians as a beloved and faithful son in the faith. The emphasis is on Timothy's role in reminding the believers of Paul's teachings in Christ. The terms 'beloved' and 'faithful' underscore the close bond between Paul and Timothy, and the commitment to teach sound doctrine.|
|1CO 4:18|Now some of you have become arrogant as though I were not coming to you.|In this verse, the Apostle Paul addresses the issue of arrogance among certain members of the Corinthian church, suggesting that their pride may have inflated their self-perception in his absence. This translation captures the tone of admonition while encouraging humility among believers.|
|1CO 4:19|But I will come to you quickly, if the Lord wills, and I will know not the words of the arrogant, but the power behind them.|This verse emphasizes the importance of divine will in Paul's plans and contrasts the superficiality of mere words with the reality of God's power.|
|1CO 4:20|For the kingdom of God does not consist in words, but in power.|This verse emphasizes the contrast between mere words and the genuine power of God's kingdom. The original text suggests that the essence of God's kingdom is not found in eloquent speech, but in the transformative power that accompanies it.|
|1CO 4:21|What do you prefer? Shall I come to you with a rod, or in love and with a spirit of gentleness?|The apostle Paul is addressing the Corinthians with a rhetorical question, expressing his intention to come to them either in a spirit of authority or with love and gentleness. The contrasting imagery between 'a rod' (which signifies discipline) and 'a spirit of love and gentleness' highlights the approach he intends to take with them.|
