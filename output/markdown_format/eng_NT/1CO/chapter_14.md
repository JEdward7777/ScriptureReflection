The word 'pursue' reflects a strong, active effort, and 'spiritual gifts' encompasses various forms of spiritual expressions. 'Prophecy' is highlighted as especially valuable for edification in the church context.|
|1CO 14:2|For he who speaks in a tongue does not speak to men, but to God; indeed, no one understands him; he utters mysteries in the Spirit.|The phrase 'speaks in a tongue' implies communication that is not directed to human listeners but is instead a form of spiritual expression intended for God. The context emphasizes the spiritual nature of this communication, highlighting its mystery and the personal relationship between the speaker and God.|
|1CO 14:3|But the one who prophesies speaks to men for their edification, encouragement, and consolation.|In this verse, the focus is on the role of prophecy in the church.

|1CO 14:4|The one who speaks in a tongue edifies himself, but the one who prophesies builds up the church.|This translation aims to clearly distinguish between the purpose of speaking in tongues and the gift of prophecy. The emphasis is placed on self-edification through speaking in tongues and the communal benefit of prophecy, in line with the apostolic teaching on spiritual gifts.|
|1CO 14:5|I desire that all of you would speak in tongues, but even more, that you would prophesy; for the one who prophesies is greater than the one who speaks in tongues, unless he interprets, so that the church may receive edification.|This translation emphasizes the importance of prophecy over speaking in tongues for the edification of the church, capturing the intent of the Apostle Paul to prioritize community edification in spiritual gifts.|
|1CO 14:6|Now, brothers, if I come to you speaking in tongues, how will I benefit you unless I speak to you either by revelation, knowledge, prophecy, or teaching?|In this verse, Paul emphasizes the importance of speaking in ways that benefit and edify the church. The terms used—revelation, knowledge, prophecy, and teaching—highlight various forms of communication that contribute to the growth and understanding of the faith community. This fresh translation aims to retain the intent and structure of the original Greek while providing clarity in contemporary English.|
|1CO 14:7|Yet even lifeless instruments, whether flute or harp, if they do not produce distinct notes, how will anyone recognize what is played?|In this verse, Paul highlights the necessity of clarity in communication, comparing the sounds made by lifeless instruments to human speech. The emphasis is on the importance of discernible distinctions in sounds to convey meaning effectively. This verse stresses that without proper distinction, the message remains unclear, paralleling the concept of intelligibility in spiritual gifts.|
|1CO 14:8|And if the trumpet produces an unclear sound, who will prepare for battle?|In this verse, the imagery of the trumpet signifies a call to readiness and action, especially in the context of war. The focus on clarity in communication is essential, as indistinct sounds fail to convey a message. This echoes the themes found in other scriptures about the significance of clear and purposeful sounds in spiritual and practical contexts.|
|1CO 14:9|So likewise you, unless you speak with a clear and meaningful word, how will what is spoken be recognized? For you will be speaking into the air.|In this verse, Paul emphasizes the importance of clarity in communication, especially in the context of speaking in tongues within the church. He likens the speech in tongues to speaking into the air unless it conveys a meaningful message that can be understood by others. The choice of words reflects the necessity for intelligible speech for effective communication and edification of the church body.|
|1CO 14:10|There are, undoubtedly, many different languages in the world, and none of them is without meaning.|In this verse, Paul emphasizes the multitude of languages that exist and their need to communicate meaningfully. The focus is on the diversity of sounds that do have meaning and the importance of intelligibility in communication, aligning with his earlier exhortation about speaking clearly.|
|1CO 14:11|Therefore, if I do not grasp the meaning of the voice, I will be a foreigner to the one speaking, and the one speaking will be a foreigner to me.|In this verse, the Apostle Paul emphasizes the necessity of understanding the spoken word to facilitate communication. The use of 'barbarian' reflects the perception of an unknown language as unintelligible. The concept of mutual understanding is crucial for the body of Christ to function effectively.|
|1CO 14:12|So it is with you; since you are zealous for spiritual gifts, seek to excel in building up the church.|In this verse, the emphasis is on the desire for spiritual gifts to serve the purpose of building up the church.

|1CO 14:13|Therefore, let the one who speaks in a tongue pray that he may interpret.|In this verse, Paul encourages those who speak in tongues to pray for the gift of interpretation. The context emphasizes the importance of edifying the church through clear communication, rather than just exhibiting spiritual gifts for their own sake. The term 'interpret' in this context refers specifically to the ability to explain or make sense of what is spoken in tongues, ensuring that the message is understood by others.|
|1CO 14:14|For if I pray in a tongue, my spirit prays, but my mind is unfruitful.|This verse highlights the duality of prayer involving both the spirit and the mind. When praying in a tongue, the spirit engages in communication with God, yet the mind does not grasp the meaning, indicating a contrast between spiritual and intellectual comprehension.|
|1CO 14:15|What is the conclusion then? I will pray with my spirit, but I will also pray with my understanding; I will sing with my spirit, but I will also sing with my understanding.|This verse emphasizes the dual nature of prayer and worship, both in the spirit and with understanding. The use of 'spirit' and 'mind' contrasts the deeper, spiritual connection with God and the necessity of comprehension in communication.|
|1CO 14:16|For if you bless with the spirit, how will he who occupies the place of the uninformed say 'Amen' at your giving of thanks, since he does not understand what you say?|In this verse, the apostle Paul emphasizes the importance of understanding in worship and communal prayer. The context suggests that merely speaking in tongues or using spiritual gifts should be comprehensible to others in the congregation. The key term 'Amen' is significant, as it represents agreement or affirmation in prayer, underscoring the need for intelligibility when we offer thanks to God.|
|1CO 14:17|For you are giving thanks well enough, but the other person is not being built up.|In this verse, the Apostle Paul emphasizes the importance of edification in worship. While one may express thanks well, it is crucial that such expressions contribute to the spiritual building up of others present, particularly those who may not understand the language being used. The focus is on collective edification rather than individual expression.|
|1CO 14:18|I thank my God that I speak in tongues more than all of you.|In this verse, the Apostle Paul expresses gratitude to God for the ability to speak in tongues, indicating a high level of personal devotion and spiritual practice.

|1CO 14:19|But in the church, I would rather speak five intelligible words to instruct others than ten thousand words in a tongue.|In this translation, the emphasis is on the contrast between speaking in tongues, which may not be understood by others, and the desire to communicate in a way that is intelligible and edifying. The phrase 'five words' emphasizes a preference for clarity and understanding in a communal worship setting.|
|1CO 14:20|Brothers, do not be children in your thinking; rather, in malice be infants, but in your thinking be mature.|The verse contrasts the mental maturity required in spiritual matters with the innocence and simplicity associated with childhood, urging believers to grow in wisdom and understanding, especially regarding malice and evil, while being innocent like children in their approach to such matters.|
|1CO 14:21|In the Law it is written: 'With other tongues and through the lips of strangers I will speak to this people, and even then they will not listen to me,' says the Lord.|This verse cites a prophecy from Isaiah, emphasizing the use of foreign languages as a means of divine communication with the people, reflecting God's ongoing revelation even in unfamiliar forms.|
|1CO 14:22|So tongues are a sign not for believers but for unbelievers; while prophecy is not for unbelievers, but for believers.|In this verse, the Apostle Paul contrasts the purpose of tongues and prophecy. Tongues serve as a sign for the unbelievers, while prophecy provides edification for believers. The terms 'believers' and 'unbelievers' are critical to understanding the intended audience for each spiritual gift.|
|1CO 14:23|If therefore the whole church assembles together and all speak in tongues, and uninformed people or unbelievers come in, will they not say that you are out of your minds?|In this verse, the Apostle Paul highlights the confusion that can arise when the church gathers and everyone speaks in tongues. The focus is on the potential misunderstanding by outsiders (unbelievers) who might perceive such behavior as madness. The use of 'idiots' (translated as 'unbelievers' in some versions) refers to those who do not understand the context of the tongues being spoken. This translation emphasizes clarity and order in worship to facilitate understanding and faith.|
|1CO 14:24|But if all prophesy, and an unbeliever or an uninformed person enters, he is convicted by all, he is called to account by all.|This verse illustrates the transformative power of prophecy in the context of worship and the impact it has on those who do not believe.

|1CO 14:25|And thus, the hidden secrets of his heart are made manifest; and so falling down on his face, he will worship God, declaring that God is truly among you.|This translation aims to capture the essence of the original Greek text, emphasizing the unveiling of hidden thoughts and the worshipful response to God. The use of 'hearts' indicates the internal state that God discerns, and 'worships' reflects the appropriate response to God's presence.|
|1CO 14:26|What then shall we say, brothers? Whenever you come together, each of you has a psalm, a teaching, a tongue, a revelation, or an interpretation. Let all things be done for the edification.|This verse emphasizes the variety of spiritual gifts and contributions that believers bring to the gathering of the church. Each individual has something to offer, whether it be a song, a teaching, a tongue, a revelation, or an interpretation. The overarching purpose of these contributions is to build up the body of Christ.|
|1CO 14:27|If anyone speaks in a tongue, let there be two or at most three, each in turn, and let someone interpret.|In this verse, the emphasis is on orderly worship and the need for interpretation when speaking in tongues. The structure encourages participation in a regulated manner to ensure clarity and edification for the entire assembly.|
|1CO 14:28|But if there is no interpreter, let him keep silent in the church and speak to himself and to God.|This verse emphasizes the importance of understanding and interpretation in public worship, urging individuals to speak privately to God if no interpreter is present.|
|1CO 14:29|Let two or three prophets speak, and let the others discern.|This translation captures the essence of Paul’s instruction regarding the orderly conduct of prophecy in the church, emphasizing the importance of mutual discernment and evaluation among the members of the congregation.|
|1CO 14:30|But if something is revealed to another who is sitting down, let the first keep silent.|The phrase 'if another is revealed' indicates a situation of revelation in the context of communal worship.

|1CO 14:32|And the spirits of the prophets are subject to the prophets.|This verse emphasizes the order and submission within the prophetic ministry, underscoring that the spirits of the prophets are under the authority of the prophets themselves, reflecting the importance of control and discernment in prophetic utterances.|
|1CO 14:33|For God is not a God of confusion, but of peace.|This verse emphasizes the character of God as one who brings order and tranquility rather than chaos. It serves as a reminder of the divine nature of peace in contrast to disorder.|
|1CO 14:34|As in all the churches of the saints, let your women keep silent in the churches; for it is not permitted for them to speak, but they are to be in submission, as also the law says.|This verse reflects the cultural context of the early church, emphasizing the roles and behavior of women within the assembly as prescribed by Jewish law. The directive for women to be silent in the church is consistent with the overall theme of order and submission found in the New Testament writings.|
|1CO 14:35|And if they wish to learn anything, let them ask their own husbands at home; for it is shameful for women to speak in the church.|This verse emphasizes the importance of maintaining order within the church, particularly in relation to the role of women. The cultural context of the time dictated specific roles for women, and this verse reflects that perspective. The use of the term 'silence' implies a demeanor of respect and decorum in the ecclesiastical setting, while encouraging women to seek understanding in a private setting with their husbands.|
|1CO 14:36|Or did the word of God originate with you? Or are you the only ones it has reached?|This verse poses a rhetorical question that emphasizes the authority and origin of the message of God.

|1CO 14:38|But if anyone chooses to be ignorant, let him remain in ignorance.|The phrase 'if anyone is ignorant' can imply a lack of awareness or willful refusal to acknowledge truth.

This echoes the themes of accountability and recognition of divine authority present in the surrounding context.|
|1CO 14:39|Therefore, brothers, earnestly desire to prophesy, and do not forbid speaking in tongues.|In this verse, Paul encourages the pursuit of prophecy and emphasizes the importance of speaking in tongues, suggesting a balance between the two gifts in worship.
