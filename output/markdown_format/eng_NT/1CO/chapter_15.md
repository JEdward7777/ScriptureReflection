|1CO 15:1|Now, brothers, I remind you of the gospel that I preached to you, which you also received and in which you stand.|In this verse, the Apostle Paul emphasizes the importance of the gospel he preached, highlighting the believers' acceptance of it and their steadfastness in it. The Greek words used indicate both a transmission of the message and a standing firm in it.|
|1CO 15:2|By this gospel you are saved, if you hold firmly to the word I preached to you; otherwise, you have believed in vain.|In this verse, Paul emphasizes the importance of holding firmly to the message of the gospel he preached, as it is the means of salvation. The phrase 'unless you believed in vain' points to the seriousness of genuine faith and belief.|
|1CO 15:3|For I delivered to you, first of all, that which I also received: that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures.|In this verse, Paul emphasizes the foundational truths of the Christian faith regarding Christ's sacrificial death. The phrase 'that Christ died for our sins' encapsulates the core message of redemption, closely tied to Old Testament prophecies about the Messiah's suffering and death for sin. The phrase 'according to the Scriptures' reinforces the idea that these events were foretold and are central to understanding Jesus's role as Savior.|
|1CO 15:4|and that He was buried, and that He rose again the third day according to the Scriptures,|This verse affirms the burial and resurrection of Christ on the third day, highlighting its fulfillment according to the Scriptures. The use of 'buried' emphasizes the reality of His death, while 'raised' signifies victory over death, connecting with the scriptural prophecies regarding the Messiah's resurrection.|
|1CO 15:5|and that He was seen by Cephas, then by the twelve.|This translation aims to capture the essence of the original Greek while maintaining clarity in English. The word 'Kepas' (or Cephas) refers to Peter, emphasizing his significance among the apostles. The structure of the sentence mirrors the Greek construction closely to retain its original intent.|
|1CO 15:6|After that, He appeared to more than five hundred of the brothers at once, most of whom are still alive, though some have fallen asleep.|This verse highlights the appearance of the resurrected Christ to a large group of believers, underscoring the reality and significance of the resurrection as a witnessed event among the brethren. The term 'brothers' is used to emphasize the communal faith and relationship among believers in Christ.|
|1CO 15:7|Then He was seen by James, and later by all the apostles.|The original Greek text emphasizes the sequential appearance of Christ to His followers, particularly to Jacob (James) and the apostles. The translation reflects the significance of these appearances in establishing the resurrection as a historical event witnessed by multiple individuals.|
|1CO 15:8|And last of all, as if I were born out of due time, He appeared to me.|In this verse, Paul identifies himself as the last of the apostles to see the risen Christ. The word 'ἔσχατον' (last) highlights the uniqueness of his encounter, referring to the timing and nature of his apostolic call. The phrase 'ὡσπερεὶ τῷ ἐκτρώματι' (as to one born out of due time) emphasizes the sudden and unexpected nature of his encounter with Christ.|
|1CO 15:9|For I am the least of the apostles, unworthy to be called an apostle, because I persecuted the church of God.|In this verse, the Apostle Paul expresses his deep humility and unworthiness for the calling he has received. His acknowledgment of being 'the least of the apostles' ties into a broader theme in Scripture where God's grace is extended to the humble and the broken. The Greek terms emphasize both his personal struggle and the transformation he underwent through Christ.|
|1CO 15:10|But by the grace of God, I am what I am; and His grace toward me was not in vain. On the contrary, I worked harder than any of them, yet not I, but the grace of God that was with me.|This verse emphasizes the role of God's grace in the apostle Paul's life and ministry, highlighting both humility and effort in response to divine grace. The Greek words 'χάριτι' (grace) and 'ἐκοπίασα' (I labored) show a connection between divine assistance and human action.|
|1CO 15:11|Whether then it is I or they, so we preach, and so you believed.|In this verse, Paul emphasizes the unity of the message of the gospel, regardless of who delivers it. The focus is on the preaching of Christ's resurrection and the faith it inspires, which is central to the Christian message.|
|1CO 15:12|Now, if Christ is proclaimed as raised from the dead, how can some of you say that there is no resurrection of the dead?|In this verse, the Apostle Paul confronts a misunderstanding within the Corinthian church regarding the resurrection of the dead. He emphasizes that if Christ is preached as raised from the dead, it contradicts the belief of some who claim there is no resurrection. This reflects the foundational Christian doctrine that is essential for faith and hope in eternal life.|
|1CO 15:13|But if there is no resurrection of the dead, then Christ has not been raised.|The verse emphasizes the importance of the resurrection of the dead, asserting that without it, Christ’s own resurrection is negated. The language used is straightforward, maintaining a logical structure that links the absence of resurrection to the non-resurrection of Christ.|
|1CO 15:14|And if Christ has not been raised, then our preaching is empty, and your faith is also empty.|This verse emphasizes the centrality of Christ's resurrection to the Christian faith. If Christ has not been raised, then the preaching of the Gospel is empty, and faith in Him is without foundation. The use of 'empty' suggests that without the resurrection, the very core of the message is void, impacting both the proclamation of the Gospel and the belief of the followers.|
|1CO 15:15|We are even found to be false witnesses of God, because we testified about God that He raised Christ, whom He did not raise if the dead are not raised.|In this verse, Paul emphasizes the seriousness of falsely proclaiming the resurrection of Christ. The term 'false witnesses' conveys the gravity of misrepresenting God's truth, particularly concerning such a central tenet of the faith as the resurrection. This translation strives to maintain the theological weight of the original Greek while providing clarity in English.|
|1CO 15:16|For if the dead do not rise, then Christ has not been raised.|This verse emphasizes the connection between the resurrection of the dead and the resurrection of Christ. The logical argument made by Paul hinges on the reality of resurrection; if the dead do not rise, then Christ's resurrection is called into question. The choice of words underscores the centrality of resurrection in Christian faith.|
|1CO 15:17|And if Christ has not been raised, your faith is futile; you are still in your sins.|This verse emphasizes the critical connection between the resurrection of Christ and the validity of faith. Without the resurrection, the faith of believers is rendered pointless, and they remain in their sins. The original text highlights the concepts of 'faith' and 'sins', which are key themes in the New Testament regarding salvation and resurrection.|
|1CO 15:18|Then those who have fallen asleep in Christ have perished.|In this verse, the term 'koi̱mēthéntes' translates to 'those who have fallen asleep,' a euphemism for death used throughout the New Testament, specifically for believers. The phrase emphasizes the finality of death in the absence of the resurrection of Christ. The term 'apólo̱ntai' translates to 'have perished' indicating that without Christ's resurrection, those who have died in faith have ultimately met a disastrous fate. Thus, the translation captures the gravity of the situation.|
|1CO 15:19|If in this life only we have hoped in Christ, we are of all people most miserable.|In this verse, the Apostle Paul underscores the futility of hope in Christ if our hope is limited to this earthly life. The choice of the words 'miserable' or 'pitiable' emphasizes the tragic state of those who cling solely to worldly aspirations without the resurrection hope. This verse serves to contrast the believer's hope in eternal life through Christ with a life devoid of resurrection faith.|
|1CO 15:20|But now Christ has been raised from the dead, the firstfruits of those who have died.|The phrase 'firstfruits of those who have fallen asleep' highlights Christ's role as the initial resurrected being, paving the way for others. The term 'fallen asleep' is often used in Scripture to refer to death, particularly for believers, suggesting a temporary state prior to resurrection.|
|1CO 15:21|For since death came through a man, the resurrection of the dead also comes through a man.|This verse emphasizes the connection between humanity and the concepts of death and resurrection, attributing both to the human condition as established by Adam's sin. It serves as a pivotal statement in Paul's argument about the transformative power of Christ's resurrection, contrasting the death brought by one man with the new life available through Christ.|
|1CO 15:22|For as in Adam all die, so also in Christ shall all be made alive.|In this translation, the parallel structure between Adam and Christ is emphasized, illustrating the theological contrast between death as the consequence of sin and the life brought about through Christ. The terms 'all' and 'will be made alive' echo the original Greek structure while making it clear that this refers to all humanity's resurrection through Christ.|
|1CO 15:23|But each in his own order: Christ the firstfruits, and afterward, those who belong to Christ at His coming.|The term 'firstfruits' (ἀπαρχὴ) is significant in biblical terminology, referring to the initial offering that signifies the whole harvest to come. In this context, it refers to Christ as the first to rise from the dead, establishing the hope of resurrection for all believers. The phrase 'at His coming' (ἐν τῇ παρουσίᾳ αὐτοῦ) denotes the future return of Christ, a pivotal event in Christian eschatology.|
|1CO 15:24|Then comes the end, when He delivers the kingdom to God the Father, after He has abolished all rule and all authority and power.|In this verse, Paul is conveying the culmination of Christ's redemptive work and the transfer of the kingdom to God the Father. Key concepts such as authority, dominion, and the ultimate end of all things are addressed, emphasizing the Christian hope of God's sovereignty.|
|1CO 15:25|For He must reign until He has put all His enemies under His feet.|This verse emphasizes the ongoing reign of Christ and His ultimate victory over all His enemies, consistent with the theme of His authority and dominion as stated in previous passages. The concept of making enemies a footstool is a metaphorical expression indicating total subjugation and defeat of opposition.|
|1CO 15:26|The last enemy to be abolished is death.|This verse succinctly highlights the finality of death's defeat, portraying it as the last enemy to be abolished in the eschatological hope of Christians. The term 'ἔσχατος' signifies the ultimate or final enemy, while 'καταργεῖται' suggests a process of being rendered inactive or abolished. The use of 'θάνατος' specifically denotes death, emphasizing the victory over it that is central to Christian faith.|
|1CO 15:27|For He has put everything in subjection under His feet. But when it says that everything has been subjected, it is clear that this does not include the One who subjected everything to Him.|This verse speaks of the total authority of Christ over all creation and clarifies the hierarchy of authority, noting that while everything is subject to Him, there is one exception—God the Father, who has placed everything under Christ's feet.|
|1CO 15:28|And when all things are subjected to Him, then the Son Himself will also be subjected to the One who put all things in subjection under Him, so that God may be all in all.|In this verse, the emphasis is on the completion of the redemptive plan where the Son willingly subjects Himself to the Father after having accomplished His mission. The terms 'subject' and 'subjection' highlight the relational order within the Trinity and the ultimate authority of God. This translation captures the theological significance of Christ's submission to ensure that God may be all in all, signifying His supreme sovereignty.|
|1CO 15:29|Otherwise, what will those do who are baptized for the dead? If the dead do not rise at all, why then are they baptized for the dead?|This verse raises a rhetorical question regarding the practice of baptism on behalf of the dead, pointing to the implications of belief in the resurrection. The Apostle Paul uses this inquiry to emphasize the importance of the resurrection for the Christian faith. It challenges the understanding of baptism's significance if there is no resurrection from the dead, reflecting early Christian practices and beliefs.|
|1CO 15:30|What are we doing, facing danger at every hour?|This verse highlights the constant risk faced by believers, underscoring the notion that faith may involve danger and sacrifice. The phrase 'we are in danger every hour' indicates the seriousness of their commitment in the face of persecution and the looming threat of death. It serves as a reminder of the struggles faced by early Christians, affirming their faith amid challenges.|
|1CO 15:31|I face death every day, and I do so by the boast I have in you, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.|In this verse, Paul expresses a deep sense of daily struggle and sacrifice, linking his endurance in the face of death to the pride he takes in his relationship with Christ. The phrase 'I die every day' emphasizes the continuous nature of his suffering and the spiritual commitment he has made. The reference to 'your boasting' connects his personal sacrifices to the larger context of their faith in Christ, reinforcing the idea that their shared faith and pride is a motivating factor in enduring hardship.|
|1CO 15:32|If I fought wild beasts in Ephesus merely from a human perspective, what did I gain? If the dead are not raised, "Let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we die."|In this verse, Paul uses hyperbolic language to express the futility of his struggles if there is no resurrection. The word 'beasts' (ἄνθρωπον ἐθηριομάχησα) signifies the dangers he faced, likely in a metaphorical sense, relating to adversaries or spiritual warfare rather than literal beasts. The phrase 'let us eat and drink' reflects a hedonistic attitude in contrast to the sacrificial life expected of a believer, underscoring the seriousness of the resurrection doctrine.|
|1CO 15:33|Do not be deceived; bad company corrupts good character.|This verse warns against being misled by associations that can corrupt good character. The word 'μὴ πλανᾶσθε' translates to 'Do not be deceived', emphasizing the danger of misleading influences. 'φθείρουσιν ἤθη χρηστὰ' directly translates to 'corrupt good morals', underscoring the negative impact of poor company.|
|1CO 15:34|Awaken to righteousness and do not sin; for some have no knowledge of God. I speak this to your shame.|In this verse, Paul admonishes the Corinthians to awaken from their ignorance and cease from sin. The phrase 'ἐκνήψατε δικαίως' conveys a call to moral clarity and alertness, while 'ἀγνωσίαν γὰρ Θεοῦ τινες ἔχουσι' points to the peril of ignorance regarding God. The expression 'πρὸς ἐντροπὴν ὑμῖν λέγω' indicates that this is a serious warning meant to provoke reflection and change in their behavior.|
|1CO 15:35|But someone will ask, 'How are the dead raised? With what kind of body do they come?'|This verse addresses the question of resurrection, particularly how the dead are raised and what kind of body they possess upon resurrection. The phrasing is intentionally crafted to provoke thought and reflection on the nature of life after death.|
|1CO 15:36|You fool! What you sow does not come to life unless it dies.|The phrase 'unless it dies' emphasizes the necessity of death for the process of resurrection and new life, drawing a parallel between physical death and spiritual renewal.|
|1CO 15:37|And what you sow is not the body that is to be, but a bare seed, perhaps of wheat or of some other grain.|In this verse, Paul is emphasizing the nature of the resurrection and the transformation that occurs from our current physical state to a glorified one. The contrast between the bare seed and the body to come highlights the transformative power of God. The word 'γυμνὸν' (bare) indicates that what is sown lacks the full form that it will ultimately take after resurrection, while 'κόκκον' (grain) reflects the potential that lies within it.|
|1CO 15:38|But God gives it a body as He has chosen, and to each seed its own body.|In this verse, Paul emphasizes God's sovereign authority in determining the form of the resurrected body, likening it to the way different seeds yield different types of bodies according to divine design. The structure of the Greek suggests a strong contrast between the earthly and heavenly bodies, reinforcing the theme of resurrection.|
|1CO 15:39|Not all flesh is the same; there is one kind for humans, another kind for animals, another for fish, and another for birds.|This verse speaks to the diversity of flesh, contrasting the types of bodies that different creatures possess. The focus is on the distinction of kinds and their respective forms. This translation maintains the original meaning while using contemporary language.|
|1CO 15:40|And there are celestial bodies, and there are terrestrial bodies; but the glory of the celestial is one kind, and the glory of the terrestrial is another.|This verse emphasizes the distinction between heavenly and earthly bodies, suggesting that each has its own glory and purpose in God's creation. The contrast between 'heavenly' and 'earthly' bodies is further illustrated by references to the transformation and nature of resurrection bodies in other scriptures.|
|1CO 15:41|There is one kind of glory of the sun, and another kind of glory of the moon, and another kind of glory of the stars; for star differs from star in glory.|In this verse, the Apostle Paul draws a distinction between different types of celestial bodies, emphasizing that each has its own unique glory. The Greek word 'δόξα' (doxa) is used to denote glory, suggesting varying degrees of brightness and honor among heavenly bodies, akin to how we might perceive the different brilliance of stars, the moon, and the sun.|
|1CO 15:42|So it is with the resurrection of the dead. It is sown in corruption, it is raised in incorruption;|This verse emphasizes the transformation that occurs in the resurrection, contrasting the decay associated with death and earthly existence with the incorruptibility of the resurrected state. It uses strong oppositional language to depict the change from mortality to immortality.|
|1CO 15:43|It is sown in dishonor; it is raised in glory. It is sown in weakness; it is raised in power.|The contrast between the conditions of the body at death and its resurrection is highlighted in this verse. 'Sown' indicates the process of burial, while 'raised' indicates the glorious transformation that follows. The terms 'dishonor' and 'glory' illustrate the transition from mortal limitations to the divine strength and honor of the resurrected body. Similarly, 'weakness' and 'power' underscore the profound change in the state of existence.|
|1CO 15:44|It is sown a natural body; it is raised a spiritual body. There is a natural body, and there is a spiritual body.|This verse contrasts the natural (soulish) body with the spiritual body. The term 'ψυχικόν' (soulish) refers to the natural, physical life we experience on earth, while 'πνευματικόν' (spiritual) indicates a transformed existence in the resurrection. This duality illustrates the profound transformation that believers undergo at resurrection.|
|1CO 15:45|Thus it is written, 'The first man Adam became a living being'; the last Adam became a life-giving spirit.|In this verse, Paul contrasts the first Adam, who became a living being (or soul), with the last Adam (Christ), who became a life-giving spirit. The use of 'soul' and 'spirit' highlights the transition from natural to spiritual life, emphasizing Christ's role in imparting spiritual life to believers.|
|1CO 15:46|But it is not the spiritual that comes first, but the natural; and afterward the spiritual.|This verse emphasizes the order of existence: first the physical, then the spiritual. In the context of resurrection and the new life given by Christ, it highlights the progression from earthly life to the new life in the Spirit.|
|1CO 15:47|The first man was made from the dust of the earth; the second man is the Lord from heaven.|This verse contrasts the nature of the first man, Adam, who was created from the earth, with the second man, Jesus Christ, who comes from heaven. The Greek word 'χοϊκός' indicates something earthly or pertaining to soil, while 'ἐξ οὐρανοῦ' highlights Jesus' divine origin. The passage illustrates the difference in origin and nature between humanity and Christ, emphasizing the spiritual superiority of Christ.|
|1CO 15:48|As was the earthly man, so are those who are of the earth; and as is the heavenly man, so also are those who are of heaven.|In this verse, Paul contrasts the nature of the earthly (or 'chthonic') with that of the heavenly. The term 'chthonic' refers to that which is earthly and mortal, drawing a parallel between humanity and the first man, Adam, made from the earth. The heavenly refers to Christ and the spiritual identity of believers. This verse underscores the transformation that believers will undergo through Christ, echoing themes of resurrection and eternal life.|
|1CO 15:49|And just as we have borne the likeness of the earthly man, so shall we bear the likeness of the heavenly man.|In this verse, the Apostle Paul draws a parallel between our current earthly existence and the future heavenly existence that awaits believers. The 'image' refers to our nature and identity, contrasting our mortal state with the divine, reflecting the transformation that comes through faith in Christ.|
|1CO 15:50|I declare to you, brothers and sisters, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God, nor does the perishable inherit the imperishable.|In this translation, I have aimed to maintain the core meaning of the original Greek text while making it accessible and relevant to contemporary readers. The terms 'flesh' and 'blood' are indicative of human nature and mortality, and their inability to inherit God's kingdom is emphasized alongside the contrast with imperishability. The concepts of decay and corruption are also key in understanding the transition to the eternal state.|
|1CO 15:51|Behold, I tell you a mystery: We will not all sleep, but we will all be changed.|This verse emphasizes the transformation that believers will experience, highlighting a divine mystery of resurrection that contrasts with physical death. The terms used ('mystery,' 'not all sleep,' 'all will be changed') suggest a moment of profound change at the coming of Christ. The Greek word 'ἀλλαγησόμεθα' indicates a transformation into a different state, reinforcing the hope of eternal life.|
|1CO 15:52|In an instant, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trumpet; for the trumpet will sound, and the dead will be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed.|In this verse, the terms 'atom' and 'twinkling of an eye' highlight the instantaneous nature of the transformation that will occur at the last trumpet. The word 'salpinx' is translated as 'trumpet' and signifies a powerful call, invoking images of divine intervention and resurrection. This context emphasizes both the resurrection of the dead and the transformation of the living believers, reflecting the power of God to change and resurrect.|
|1CO 15:53|For this perishable body must be clothed with imperishability, and this mortal body must be clothed with immortality.|This verse emphasizes the necessity for mortal, perishable bodies to be transformed into immortal, imperishable bodies. The terms 'φθαρτὸν' (perishable) and 'ἀθάνατον' (immortal) highlight the contrast between our current state and the promised future state in Christ. The verb 'ἐνδύσασθαι' (to put on) conveys a sense of clothing oneself in a new identity or nature.|
|1CO 15:54|But when this perishable body is clothed with imperishability, and this mortal body is clothed with immortality, then the saying that is written will come to pass: 'Death has been swallowed up in victory.'|This verse highlights the transformation that occurs at the resurrection when the mortal and corruptible bodies are replaced with immortal and incorruptible ones. The quotation from Scripture emphasizes the victory over death.|
|1CO 15:55|Where, O death, is your sting? Where, O Hades, is your victory?|In this translation, the expressions are rendered with emphasis on the rhetorical questioning inherent in the original Greek text, capturing the victorious tone of the message against death and Hades.|
|1CO 15:56|The sting of death is sin, and the power of sin is the Law.|In this verse, the metaphorical language highlights the relationship between sin and death, portraying sin as the sharp point that inflicts the ultimate harm of death. The 'strength' of sin is understood to be the Law, which reveals sin and holds humanity accountable, emphasizing the seriousness of sin in relation to death.|
|1CO 15:57|But thanks be to God, who gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.|This verse emphasizes gratitude to God for granting us victory through Jesus Christ, echoing themes of triumph found throughout the New Testament.|
|1CO 15:58|Therefore, my beloved brothers, be steadfast, immovable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, knowing that your labor is not in vain in the Lord.|This verse encourages believers to be steadfast and dedicated in their work for the Lord. The words 'steadfast' and 'immovable' convey a strong sense of resilience, while 'abounding in the work of the Lord' reflects the importance of diligence and commitment to the mission of faith. The phrase 'your labor is not in vain in the Lord' assures believers that their efforts are meaningful and rewarded by God.|
