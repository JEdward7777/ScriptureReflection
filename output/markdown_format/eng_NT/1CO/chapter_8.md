| Reference | Verse | Translation Notes |
|:---------:|-------|-------------------|
|1CO 8:1|Now concerning food offered to idols, we know that we all possess knowledge. However, knowledge puffs up, but love builds up.|The phrase 'knowledge' here refers to an understanding that may lead to pride, indicating that mere knowledge does not equate to true spiritual wisdom. The context suggests a caution against being puffed up by one's knowledge regarding food offered to idols.|
|1CO 8:2|If anyone thinks he knows something, he has not yet come to know as he ought to know.|In this verse, Paul contrasts knowledge that can lead to arrogance with love that fosters community and support. The term 'knowledge' is used in a way that reflects a potential danger of pride, while 'love' is portrayed as the foundation of Christian living. This translation captures that contrast clearly.|
|1CO 8:3|But if anyone loves God, he is known by Him.|This translation emphasizes the reciprocal relationship of love between God and those who truly love Him, reflecting the original Greek nuance that acknowledges a special recognition or acknowledgment from God towards those who love Him.|
|1CO 8:4|Therefore, concerning the eating of food offered to idols, we know that an idol is nothing in the world, and that there is no other God but one.|This verse addresses the nature of idols and the singularity of God, emphasizing that in the Christian faith, there is only one true God as opposed to the many idols present in the pagan culture.|
|1CO 8:5|For even if there are so-called gods, whether in heaven or on earth—as indeed there are many so-called gods and many lords,|In this verse, the Apostle Paul addresses the existence of supposed deities in the heavens and on the earth, affirming that while many claim divine status, their reality is diminished by the supremacy of the one true God. The structure reflects the comparative nature of their existence, pointing to the distinction between the true God and those who are falsely worshiped.|
|1CO 8:6|Yet for us there is one God, the Father, from whom are all things and for whom we exist, and one Lord, Jesus Christ, through whom are all things and through whom we exist.|In this verse, the Apostle Paul emphasizes the uniqueness of God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ, highlighting their roles in creation and the believers' relationship with them. The structure contrasts the plurality of gods with the singularity of the true God and Lord, affirming monotheism central to Christian doctrine.|
|1CO 8:7|However, not everyone possesses this knowledge. Some, through their conscience being weak, still eat food offered to idols as if it were something sacrificial, and their conscience is defiled.|In this verse, the Apostle Paul highlights the difference in understanding and conscience among believers regarding the consumption of food offered to idols. While knowledge is acknowledged, Paul emphasizes that not everyone possesses the same understanding, which can lead to a troubled conscience for some.|
|1CO 8:8|But food does not commend us to God. We are no better if we eat, and no worse if we do not eat.|This verse emphasizes that food itself does not have any inherent value in relation to our standing before God. It highlights the idea that whether one eats or abstains from food does not affect their spiritual condition or relationship with God, but rather, it is a matter of personal conscience and the knowledge one possesses about the issue.|
|1CO 8:9|But beware that this liberty of yours does not become a stumbling block to those who are weak.|This verse emphasizes the responsibility of those with knowledge and freedom in Christ to consider how their actions might impact weaker believers. The use of 'stumbling block' illustrates the potential danger posed by exercising one's liberty without regard for others' spiritual well-being.|
|1CO 8:10|For if someone sees you, who have knowledge, reclining at a table in an idol’s temple, will not his conscience, being weak, be emboldened to eat the things offered to idols?|This verse emphasizes the influence of one's actions on the conscience of another, particularly highlighting how knowledge can lead to a weak conscience being misled when it observes someone with greater knowledge participating in practices that could be perceived as idolatrous. The structure mirrors the moral concern for the weak, showcasing the call for responsible behavior among believers.|
|1CO 8:11|And so, by your knowledge, the brother who is weak perishes, for whom Christ died.|The Greek word 'ἀσθενῶν' refers to a weaker brother or one whose conscience is not as strong. This verse emphasizes the gravity of leading others into sin through one's actions. The phrase 'δι᾽ ὃν Χριστὸς ἀπέθανεν' highlights the significance of Christ's sacrifice in the context of how we treat one another, especially those who are weaker in faith.|
|1CO 8:12|Thus, by sinning against the brothers and wounding their weak conscience, you are sinning against Christ.|In this verse, the emphasis is on the impact of one's actions on the conscience of a weaker brother. The term 'sinning' refers to the act of causing someone to stumble or fall in their faith, and the mention of 'conscience' reflects the moral and spiritual awareness that can be damaged by our actions. This fresh translation seeks to capture the seriousness of leading another into sin, especially in the context of Christian community.|
|1CO 8:13|Therefore, if food causes my brother to stumble, I will never eat meat again, so that I may not cause my brother to stumble.|This verse addresses the responsibility of believers to consider the impact of their actions on others, particularly on those with weaker consciences. The emphasis is on self-denial for the sake of unity and love within the Christian community.|
