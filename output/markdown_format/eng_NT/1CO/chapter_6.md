| Reference | Verse | Translation Notes |
|:---------:|-------|-------------------|
|1CO 6:1|Does any of you, when he has a matter against another, dare to go to law before the unjust instead of before the saints?|In this verse, Paul addresses the issue of believers taking their disputes before secular courts instead of resolving them within the church. The key term 'ἀδίκων' (the unrighteous) emphasizes the contrast between those who act unjustly and the 'ἁγίων' (the saints) who should be engaged in righteous judgment.|
|1CO 6:2|Do you not know that the saints will judge the world? And if the world is judged by you, are you unworthy to judge the smallest matters?|This verse emphasizes the authority and responsibility of believers to judge matters among themselves rather than relying on secular authorities. The term 'saints' refers to the holy ones of God, indicating their elevated status in His kingdom, particularly concerning judgment. The phrase 'least matters' suggests the trivial nature of the disputes, highlighting that if they are capable of judging the world, they should be able to handle minor issues among themselves.|
|1CO 6:3|Do you not know that we will judge angels? How much more, then, matters of this life?|In this verse, Paul emphasizes the authority given to believers, indicating that they will judge angels. The term 'angels' can refer to both divine and fallen beings, underscoring the weighty responsibility that the saints hold. The phrase 'smallest matters' highlights the insignificance of earthly disputes in light of the spiritual authority of the believers.|
|1CO 6:4|If you have judgments concerning matters of this life, why do you appoint those who are regarded as of no account in the church to decide?|The Greek term 'βιωτικὰ' (biotika) implies matters pertaining to everyday life or worldly issues, while 'κριτήρια' (criteria) refers to standards or judgments. The phrase 'ἐξουθενημένους' (exouthenemenous) means those who are despised or considered of low status, which can highlight the paradox of judging the less esteemed within the community.|
|1CO 6:5|I say this to your shame. Is there not a wise person among you, not even one who is able to mediate between his brothers?|In this verse, Paul is expressing his disappointment at the lack of wise individuals within the church community to resolve disputes. The Greek word 'ἐντροπή' conveys a sense of shame or embarrassment, suggesting that this situation reflects poorly on the believers. The use of 'σοφὸς' emphasizes the need for wisdom, and the phrase 'ἀνὰ μέσον' indicates the desire for fair judgment among brethren.|
|1CO 6:6|But instead, brother goes to law against brother, and that before unbelievers.|In this verse, Paul highlights the unfortunate reality that disputes arise between fellow believers, emphasizing the shame of resorting to secular judgments instead of resolving issues within the Christian community. The phrase 'between brothers' underscores the familial aspect of the church, while 'unbelievers' signifies those outside the faith.|
|1CO 6:7|Indeed, it is already a defeat for you that you have lawsuits against one another. Why not rather suffer wrong? Why not rather be defrauded?|This verse addresses the shameful situation where believers are engaging in lawsuits against one another. The term 'defeat' highlights the loss of unity and witness among the church. Paul is urging the Corinthians to consider the moral implications of their actions and suggesting that suffering injustice is preferable to engaging in legal disputes, especially before outsiders.|
|1CO 6:8|But you wrong one another and defraud, even your own brothers?|In this verse, Paul addresses the issue of wrongdoing within the community of believers. The Greek words 'ἀδικεῖτε' (you wrong) and 'ἀποστερεῖτε' (you defraud) indicate a serious ethical failure among the Corinthian Christians, particularly in how they treat each other. This translation seeks to capture the gravity of the situation and the relational dynamics at play.|
|1CO 6:9|Or do you not know that the unrighteous will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived: neither the sexually immoral, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor men who practice homosexuality,|In this verse, Paul warns the Corinthian church about the consequences of sinful behavior, specifically highlighting various forms of immorality and idolatry that are incompatible with inheriting God's kingdom. The terms used reflect cultural practices of the time but serve to emphasize a moral standard that transcends context. Each term used in the original Greek has significant implications in a Christian ethical framework.|
|1CO 6:10|nor greedy, nor thieves, nor drunkards, nor slanderers, nor swindlers will inherit the kingdom of God.|This translation emphasizes the types of behaviors that exclude individuals from inheriting the kingdom of God, aligning with the moral teachings found throughout Scripture. The use of 'covetous' captures the essence of 'πλεονέκτης' in a contextually rich manner, while 'thieves' reflects 'κλέπτης' accurately in its ethical context.|
|1CO 6:11|And such were some of you. But you were washed, you were sanctified, you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and by the Spirit of our God.|This verse emphasizes the transformative work of Christ and the Holy Spirit in the lives of believers. The terms "washed," "sanctified," and "justified" indicate the process of being made clean and righteous before God, reflecting the change from a sinful life to a life of holiness.|
|1CO 6:12|"All things are lawful for me," but not everything is beneficial; "all things are lawful for me," but I will not be dominated by anything.|The translation captures the duality of freedom and accountability emphasized in the original Greek. It highlights that while all things are permitted, not everything contributes positively to our well-being or spiritual growth. The use of 'will be dominated' reflects the idea of being mastered by desires or influences that one should resist.|
|1CO 6:13|Food is meant for the stomach, and the stomach for food; but God will bring both to an end. The body is not meant for sexual immorality, but for the Lord, and the Lord for the body.|This verse emphasizes the distinction between physical desires and spiritual purpose. The phrase 'the stomach for food' is a metaphor for bodily needs, and 'God will do away with both' signifies the temporary nature of physical appetites compared to the eternal nature of spiritual matters. The emphasis on the body being for the Lord underscores the Christian belief in the sanctity of the body as a temple for the Holy Spirit.|
|1CO 6:14|And God raised the Lord, and He will also raise us up by His power.|In this verse, Paul emphasizes the power of God in raising Jesus and the future resurrection of believers. The term 'raise' indicates a divine action that has significant implications for the physical body, linking it to the body’s purpose for the Lord.|
|1CO 6:15|Do you not know that your bodies are members of Christ? Shall I then take the members of Christ and make them members of a prostitute? Certainly not!|This verse emphasizes the sacredness of the believer's body as part of Christ’s body, highlighting the seriousness of immorality and the union believers have with Christ. The phrase 'members of Christ' underlines the concept of unity within the body of believers.|
|1CO 6:16|Or do you not know that he who is joined to a prostitute becomes one body with her? For it is said, 'The two shall become one flesh.'|In this verse, the Apostle Paul highlights the profound unity between two individuals who engage in sexual relations, equating it to the creation ordinance where two become one flesh. This emphasizes not only the physical union but also the spiritual implications of such relationships, especially in the context of fornication. The use of the term 'prostitute' underscores the moral seriousness of engaging in such acts outside the covenant of marriage.|
|1CO 6:17|But he who is joined to the Lord is one spirit with Him.|This translation emphasizes the spiritual union with the Lord as being a single entity, using the imagery of the body to illustrate the depth of this connection. The term 'one spirit' is intended to reflect a profound spiritual unity that goes beyond mere physical joining, resonating with the overarching theme of unity in the body of Christ.|
|1CO 6:18|Flee from sexual immorality. Every other sin a person commits is outside the body, but the one who engages in sexual immorality sins against his own body.|In this verse, the apostle Paul emphasizes the urgency of fleeing from sexual immorality, portraying it as a unique sin that is committed against one’s own body. This contrasts with other sins which are external to the body. The phrase 'flee from sexual immorality' indicates a proactive stance against such behaviors, highlighting the need for spiritual and physical purity.|
|1CO 6:19|Or do you not realize that your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit within you, whom you have from God? You are not your own.|This verse emphasizes the indwelling of the Holy Spirit in believers, portraying the body as a sacred temple. The use of 'temple' (ναὸς) indicates a place of divine presence and holiness, stressing the responsibility of believers to honor their bodies as vessels of the Holy Spirit.|
|1CO 6:20|For you were bought with a price. Therefore, glorify God in your body and in your spirit, which are God's.|This verse emphasizes the concept of being redeemed and the call to glorify God through our bodies and spirits, which belong to Him. The term 'bought' signifies the price paid through Christ's sacrifice, and 'glorify' highlights our responsibility to honor God in all aspects of our lives.|
