| Reference | Verse | Translation Notes |
|:---------:|-------|-------------------|
|1CO 13:1|If I speak in the tongues of men and of angels, but do not have love, I am nothing more than a resounding gong or a clanging cymbal.|This translation emphasizes the necessity of love in the act of speaking, whether in human languages or angelic. The terms used for 'sounding brass' and 'clanging cymbal' metaphorically illustrate the emptiness of communication devoid of love.|
|1CO 13:2|And if I possess the gift of prophecy and understand all mysteries and all knowledge; and if I have all faith so as to remove mountains, but do not have love, I am nothing.|In this verse, the Apostle Paul emphasizes the paramount importance of love, contrasting it with the possession of spiritual gifts and knowledge. The Greek word for 'nothing' indicates total insignificance without love, underscoring that spiritual gifts, while valuable, are meaningless in the absence of love.|
|1CO 13:3|And if I were to give away all my possessions, and if I were to surrender my body to be burned, but do not have love, I gain nothing.|In this verse, the Apostle Paul emphasizes that self-sacrifice, whether through material generosity or even martyrdom, holds no value in the eyes of God if it is not motivated by love. The terms used in the original Greek suggest extreme actions, highlighting that the true essence of a believer's actions lies in love. This translation seeks to retain the gravity of Paul's message while conveying its meaning clearly in contemporary English.|
|1CO 13:4|Love is patient; love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud.|The word 'love' in this context refers to the Greek term 'ἀγάπη' (agape), which denotes an unconditional, selfless love. The descriptions that follow are crafted to emphasize the enduring and humble nature of true love, distinguishing it from envy, pride, or arrogance. 'Long-suffering' captures the essence of being patient in difficult situations.|
|1CO 13:5|It does not behave inappropriately, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily provoked, it does not take account of wrongs.|This translation aims to encapsulate the essence of love as described in the context of 1 Corinthians 13. The terms 'unseemly' and 'self-seeking' capture the notion of dignity and respect in love, while the idea of not being 'provoked' and not 'counting wrongs' illustrates love's forgiving nature.|
|1CO 13:6|It does not rejoice in unrighteousness, but rejoices with the truth.|This verse contrasts the attitude towards wrongdoing with the joy found in truth. It emphasizes the moral alignment of love with righteousness and the rejection of injustice. The translation maintains fidelity to the original language while aiming for clarity and coherence in English.|
|1CO 13:7|Love always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres.|In this verse, the original Greek uses the terms 'always' (πάντα) to emphasize a consistent and unwavering nature of love. The verbs 'bears' (στέγει), 'believes' (πιστεύει), 'hopes' (ἐλπίζει), and 'endures' (ὑπομένει) reflect the active attributes of love that persist regardless of circumstances. This translation aims to capture the essence of these qualities in the context of love as described by Paul.|
|1CO 13:8|Love never fails. But where there are prophecies, they will cease; where there are tongues, they will be stilled; where there is knowledge, it will pass away.|This verse emphasizes the eternal and unyielding nature of love, contrasting it with other spiritual gifts that will ultimately cease. The Greek word 'ἐκπίπτει' (ekpiptē) indicates that love never falls away or fails, reinforcing the idea that love transcends time and circumstance.|
|1CO 13:9|For we know in part and we prophesy in part;|In this verse, the Apostle Paul emphasizes the partial understanding and revelation that we have in this life. The Greek words used indicate a recognition that our current grasp of truth is limited, hence the use of 'in part' as a modifier. The focus is on the transitional nature of knowledge and prophecy before the arrival of complete revelation through love.|
|1CO 13:10|But when the perfect comes, that which is partial will be done away with.|The term 'the perfect' in this verse refers to the complete and ultimate fulfillment of God's revelation and plan. The Greek word 'τέλειον' implies maturity and completeness, suggesting a state where partial knowledge and prophesying will cease when full knowledge comes. This completion can be understood as the coming of Christ or the fulfillment of God's kingdom.|
|1CO 13:11|When I was a child, I spoke like a child, I thought like a child, I reasoned like a child; but when I became a man, I put away childish things.|This verse contrasts childish behavior with maturity. The Greek term 'νήπιος' (infant/child) implies a lack of maturity in speech, thought, and understanding, which the Apostle Paul contrasts with the characteristics of a mature person. The use of 'ἀνήρ' (man) here denotes someone who has attained maturity and the ability to think and act responsibly. This aligns with the overall message of 1 Corinthians 13, which emphasizes the importance of love as a foundation for spiritual maturity.|
|1CO 13:12|For now we see in a mirror dimly, but then we shall see face to face. Now I know in part, but then I shall know fully, even as I have been fully known.|The verse contrasts the partial understanding we have in this life with the complete understanding that will come in the presence of God. The metaphor of seeing in a mirror suggests that our current understanding is unclear and indirect, while the future clarity of direct fellowship with God will reveal the full truth. Terms like 'in part' and 'face to face' highlight the transition from incomplete knowledge to perfect knowledge.|
|1CO 13:13|And now these three remain: faith, hope, and love. But the greatest of these is love.|The terms 'faith', 'hope', and 'love' are key concepts in Christian doctrine, symbolizing essential aspects of the believer's life. This translation maintains the original emphasis on the supremacy of love among the three virtues, consistent with the Apostle Paul's teachings.|
