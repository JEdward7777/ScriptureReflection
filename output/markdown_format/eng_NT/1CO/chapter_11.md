|1CO 11:1|Be imitators of me, as I am of Christ.|The term 'imitators' in this verse calls for believers to model their lives after the example set by Paul, who in turn models his life after Christ.

|1CO 11:2|I commend you, brothers, that you remember me in everything and maintain the teachings just as I delivered them to you.|In this verse, Paul commends the Corinthians for remembering and holding onto the teachings he delivered to them. The use of the word 'traditions' here reflects the importance of the teachings in the early church context, emphasizing their preservation and adherence.|
|1CO 11:3|But I want you to understand that the head of every man is Christ, the head of the woman is her husband, and the head of Christ is God.|This verse outlines the divine order within the relationships among Christ, men, and women, emphasizing authority and submission. The use of 'head' metaphorically indicates leadership and responsibility, not an inherent value or worth. It is essential to maintain the original hierarchical structure presented in the text while ensuring clarity and modern comprehension.|
|1CO 11:4|Every man who prays or prophesies with his head covered brings shame upon his head.|In this verse, the concepts of 'prayer' and 'prophecy' are linked with the notion of 'headship.' The head symbolizes authority and honor, and here, the apostle Paul emphasizes the importance of conducting oneself in a manner that upholds this order, particularly for men during acts of worship. The phrase 'having his head covered' metaphorically represents an action that could bring shame upon Christ, the head of man, thus underscoring the need for respect and proper decorum in spiritual practices.|
|1CO 11:5|But every woman who prays or prophesies with her head uncovered dishonors her head; for it is one and the same as if her head were shaved.|In this verse, the concepts of prayer and prophecy are significant, as they relate to the public display of faith. The cultural context of head coverings during worship is also key to understanding this text, emphasizing respect for authority and propriety in worship settings.|
|1CO 11:6|For if a woman does not cover her head, let her also be shorn; but if it is shameful for a woman to be shorn or shaved, let her cover her head.|In this verse, Paul addresses the issue of head coverings in the context of worship and social norms of the time. The language emphasizes the distinction of behavior expected from women regarding their appearance and the potential implications of their choices. The use of 'shorn' (κειράσθω) reflects a cultural understanding of shame associated with a woman's hair being cut short or shaved. The structure encourages consideration of societal norms and personal conduct in a manner that aligns with divine principles of honor.|
|1CO 11:7|For a man ought not to cover his head, being the image and glory of God; but woman is the glory of man.|In this verse, Paul highlights the distinction of roles and glory between men and women, emphasizing that man does not cover his head because he reflects the glory of God, while woman reflects the glory of man. The use of the terms 'image' and 'glory' are pivotal in understanding the theological basis of headship and authority.|
|1CO 11:8|For man does not come from woman, but woman comes from man.|This verse emphasizes the order of creation, where man is not produced from woman, but woman originates from man, highlighting the divine design of gender roles.|

|1CO 11:10|For this reason, a woman should have a symbol of authority on her head because of the angels.|This verse emphasizes the need for a woman to have authority over her head as a reflection of the divine order and the respect for angels. The word 'authority' in this context points to the recognition of spiritual hierarchy and order.|

|1CO 11:14|Does not nature itself teach you that if a man has long hair, it is a disgrace to him?|This verse speaks to the cultural implications of appearance in worship and how nature itself teaches about the honor and shame associated with gendered expressions of hair. The focus is on the natural order as it relates to gender distinctions, highlighting a respect for God's created design.|
|1CO 11:15|But if a woman has long hair, it is her glory? For her hair is given to her as a covering.|In this verse, the Apostle Paul addresses the topic of a woman's hair as a sign of glory and honor.

The terms 'oikias' (houses) and 'ekklēsias' (churches) are contrasted to emphasize the community's duty towards one another, particularly towards those who are less fortunate. The rhetorical questions are designed to provoke self-reflection and correction among the believers regarding their treatment of one another.|

The key elements include receiving from the Lord, giving thanks, breaking the bread, and a reference to the night of Jesus' betrayal. This highlights both the sacredness of the event and the connection to the suffering of Christ.|
|1CO 11:24|"Take, eat; this is my body, which is broken for you. Do this in remembrance of me."|This verse emphasizes the significance of the Lord's Supper and its role as a memorial of Christ's sacrifice.

|1CO 11:27|Therefore, whoever eats this bread or drinks this cup of the Lord in an unworthy manner will be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord.|This translation captures the solemnity of partaking of the Lord's Supper and the seriousness of doing so unworthily, which ties into the broader themes of communion and reverence in the New Testament.|
|1CO 11:28|But let a person examine himself, and so let him eat of the bread and drink of the cup.|In this verse, Paul emphasizes the importance of self-examination before participating in the Lord's Supper. The use of 'examine' conveys the need for a deep, personal reflection on one's spiritual state.
