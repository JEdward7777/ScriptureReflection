| Reference | Verse | Translation Notes |
|:---------:|-------|-------------------|
|1CO 12:1|Now concerning spiritual gifts, brothers, I do not want you to be uninformed.|The term 'spiritual gifts' here is significant as Paul addresses the Corinthian church's misunderstandings and misuse of these gifts. The phrase 'I do not want you to be ignorant' indicates the importance of understanding spiritual matters for the growth and unity of the church.|
|1CO 12:2|You know that when you were Gentiles, you were carried away to mute idols, however you were led.|This verse emphasizes the former condition of the Corinthians before their conversion, highlighting their worship of silent idols as opposed to their new faith in the living God. The phrase 'as you were led' indicates that they were not fully aware or understanding of their actions, suggesting a degree of spiritual ignorance common among the Gentiles before coming to faith.|
|1CO 12:3|Therefore, I want you to understand that no one speaking by the Spirit of God says, 'Jesus be cursed,' and no one can say, 'Jesus is Lord,' except by the Holy Spirit.|In this verse, the apostle Paul emphasizes the role of the Holy Spirit in affirming Jesus as Lord. The terms used here ('Lord' and 'Jesus') are pivotal in the early Christian community's confession of faith, indicating that true acknowledgment of Christ comes from the Holy Spirit. The contrast between speaking against Jesus and the inability to confess Him as Lord without the Holy Spirit reflects early Christian beliefs about the nature of faith and spiritual insight.|
|1CO 12:4|Now there are varieties of gifts, but the same Spirit.|The phrase 'diversities of gifts' implies that the gifts are not only varied but also given according to the purpose of the Holy Spirit. The use of the term 'same Spirit' emphasizes the unity of source for these gifts despite their differences, underlining the cooperative nature of the Body of Christ.|
|1CO 12:5|And there are varieties of services, but it is the same Lord who is served.|This verse emphasizes the diversity of service within the body of Christ, acknowledging that while there are various forms of ministry, the source and purpose remain unified under the lordship of Christ. The term 'διακονίαι' (ministries or services) refers to different ways of serving in the church, echoing the theme of unity and diversity in the preceding context.|
|1CO 12:6|And there are different workings, but it is the same God who is at work in all things.|In this verse, Paul emphasizes that while there are different activities and workings among believers, it is the one true God who is actively involved in all things for the good of the Church. The use of 'εργημάτων' implies various kinds of operations or manifestations of divine power, while 'Θεός' emphasizes the unity of God’s nature and His omnipresence in these operations.|
|1CO 12:7|To each one is given the manifestation of the Spirit for the benefit of all.|The phrase 'the manifestation of the Spirit' emphasizes the visibility and active presence of the Holy Spirit in the community of believers, leading to the edification of the church. 'For the common good' indicates that these gifts are intended for the benefit of the body of Christ, rather than for individual glorification.|
|1CO 12:8|For to one is given through the Spirit the word of wisdom, and to another the word of knowledge according to the same Spirit.|The translation emphasizes the distinct spiritual gifts that come from the same Spirit. 'Wisdom' and 'knowledge' are both significant gifts in the Christian faith, and their differentiation is crucial for understanding the variety of gifts provided by the Holy Spirit for the benefit of the Church.|
|1CO 12:9|To another, faith by the same Spirit; to another, gifts of healing by the one Spirit.|This verse emphasizes the diversity of spiritual gifts given by the Holy Spirit, specifically highlighting faith and healing as manifestations of God's grace. It is essential to retain the original intent of 'faith' in the context of spiritual gifts, and the connection with the Holy Spirit is maintained throughout.|
|1CO 12:10|to another, workings of miracles; to another, prophecy; to another, discerning of spirits; to another, various kinds of tongues; to another, the interpretation of tongues.|In this verse, Paul lists various spiritual gifts provided by the Holy Spirit to different individuals within the church. The terms used emphasize the diversity of gifts and the supernatural empowerment behind them.|
|1CO 12:11|But all these things are empowered by one and the same Spirit, who distributes to each one individually as He wills.|In this verse, the focus is on the singular action of the Holy Spirit, emphasizing the unity and diversity of spiritual gifts among believers. The phrase 'as He wills' indicates the sovereignty of the Spirit in distributing these gifts according to His divine purpose.|
|1CO 12:12|For just as the body is one and has many members, and all the members of that one body, being many, are one body, so also is Christ.|In this translation, I have aimed to convey the metaphor of the body and its many members to illustrate the unity of the Church as the body of Christ. The structure of the sentence maintains the original Greek flow while ensuring clarity for contemporary readers.|
|1CO 12:13|For by one Spirit we were all baptized into one body, whether Jews or Greeks, whether slaves or free, and we were all made to drink of one Spirit.|This verse emphasizes the unity of believers in Christ through the Holy Spirit, irrespective of their cultural or social backgrounds. The concept of baptism into one body reflects the profound spiritual transformation that occurs when individuals accept Christ and the inclusivity of the Gospel message. The term 'baptized' suggests an initiation into a communal identity that transcends earthly divisions.|
|1CO 12:14|For the body is not one member, but many.|In this verse, Paul emphasizes the diversity of members within the church body, reinforcing the idea that while there are many individual members, they all contribute to the whole, functioning together as one body in Christ. This translation reflects the original Greek structure and intent, underscoring the importance of unity in diversity within the body of believers.|
|1CO 12:15|If the foot should say, 'Because I am not a hand, I am not a part of the body,' would it therefore cease to be part of the body?|This verse emphasizes the interconnectedness and unity of the body of Christ. The metaphor of the body is used to illustrate how each part, though different, is essential for the overall function of the body. The phrase 'not of the body' is crucial in conveying the idea that just because one part perceives itself as separate does not mean it is any less part of the whole.|
|1CO 12:16|And if the ear says, 'Because I am not an eye, I am not part of the body,' is it therefore not part of the body?|In this verse, the metaphor of the body is further developed to illustrate the interdependence of its parts. The ear’s identity is questioned based on its function and role within the body, emphasizing that every part is necessary and holds value regardless of its distinctiveness.|
|1CO 12:17|If the whole body were an eye, where would the hearing be? If the whole were hearing, where would the sense of smell be?|In this verse, Paul uses a rhetorical question to illustrate the interconnectedness and dependence of the body parts, emphasizing that every part has its unique role and value, regardless of its function. The imagery of the body is common in Pauline literature to express unity within diversity in the church.|
|1CO 12:18|But now God has arranged each one of the members in the body just as He desired.|This verse emphasizes God's sovereignty in assigning roles within the body of Christ, illustrating the diversity of functions within the unity of the church. The choice of the term 'placed' highlights divine intentionality, reflecting the theme of unity amidst diversity.|
|1CO 12:19|But if all were one member, where would the body be?|In this verse, Paul uses a rhetorical question to emphasize the importance of diversity within the body of Christ. The metaphor of the body highlights how different members (individuals) contribute uniquely to the whole, and he implies that if everything were the same, it would lack purpose and function.|
|1CO 12:20|But now, there are many members, yet one body.|This verse emphasizes the diversity within the unity of the Church as the body of Christ, underscoring that while there are many members with different roles, they all contribute to one cohesive whole.|
|1CO 12:21|The eye cannot say to the hand, ‘I have no need of you’; nor again the head to the feet, ‘I have no need of you.’|In this verse, Paul uses the imagery of the body to emphasize the interconnectedness and necessity of each part within the Church. The expression reflects a metaphorical dialogue where one part (the eye) insists it does not need another part (the hand), which is not true, as all parts are essential to the function of the body.|
|1CO 12:22|But much more, those members of the body that seem to be weaker are indispensable.|This verse emphasizes the importance of every part of the body in the body of Christ, highlighting that those who may appear weaker are indeed essential and necessary. The translation aims to convey the same sense of necessity and value among the members of the body, with a focus on their perceived weakness.|
|1CO 12:23|And those parts of the body that we consider less honorable, we bestow greater honor upon; and our unpresentable parts are treated with even greater modesty.|The verse highlights the concept of honor given to parts of the body that may seem less significant or are considered shameful, suggesting a deeper appreciation and respect for all members within the body of Christ. The words 'honor' and 'more' are central to the meaning.|
|1CO 12:24|But our more presentable parts have no need for special treatment. Yet God has composed the body, giving greater honor to the parts that lacked it.|The phrase 'elegant parts' suggests aspects of the body that are considered honorable and presentable. The emphasis in the verse is on God's arrangement of the body, signifying that He gives honor to those members that may not be naturally esteemed, enhancing the sense of unity and interdependence in the church.|
|1CO 12:25|so that there may be no division in the body, but that its members may have the same care for one another.|This verse emphasizes the importance of unity and mutual care within the body of Christ, using the metaphor of a physical body to illustrate how different parts must work together harmoniously. The choice of words aims to reflect the original intent of maintaining a cohesive and supportive community among believers.|
|1CO 12:26|And if one member suffers, all the members suffer together; if one member is honored, all the members rejoice together.|The Greek text uses the concept of the body to illustrate the interconnectedness of believers in Christ. The terms 'suffers' and 'rejoices' reflect both the shared struggles and joys experienced within the Christian community. This translation emphasizes the communal aspect of the body of Christ, where each member's experiences affect the whole.|
|1CO 12:27|Now you are the body of Christ, and each one of you is a part of it.|The phrase 'you are' emphasizes the identity of believers as collectively part of Christ's body. The term 'members' indicates individual roles within the community of faith, reinforcing the interdependence of the Church.|
|1CO 12:28|And God has appointed in the church first apostles, second prophets, third teachers, then miracles, followed by gifts of healing, assistance, leadership, and various kinds of tongues.|This verse emphasizes the roles established by God within the church. The order and specific functions serve to illustrate the diversity and unity of the church's ministry, echoing the earlier assertion of collective identity in Christ. It highlights both leadership and spiritual gifts essential for the church's growth and edification.|
|1CO 12:29|Are all apostles? Are all prophets? Are all teachers? Do all work miracles?|The verse emphasizes the diversity of roles within the church and highlights the rhetorical questions to illustrate that not everyone holds the same office or function. The parallel structure reinforces the idea of unity in diversity.|
|1CO 12:30|Do all have gifts of healing? Do all speak in tongues? Do all interpret?|This verse emphasizes the diversity of spiritual gifts within the church. It implies that not all believers possess the same abilities or gifts, specifically referring to the gifts of healing and speaking in tongues. The rhetorical questions indicate that these gifts are given as God sees fit, promoting unity and purpose in the body of Christ.|
|1CO 12:31|But earnestly desire the greater gifts. And yet, I will show you a way that surpasses all.|The Greek phrase 'ζηλοῦτε δὲ τὰ χαρίσματα τὰ κρείττονα' can be rendered as 'But earnestly desire the greater gifts.' The term 'καὶ ἔτι καθ᾽ ὑπερβολὴν ὁδὸν ὑμῖν δείκνυμι' suggests an indication of a 'more excellent way' which I have interpreted as guiding toward a path of love that transcends all gifts.|
