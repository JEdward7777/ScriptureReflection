It uses the term 'stumbling block' for the Jews, indicating a major barrier to belief, while for the Greeks, it represents foolishness, showing a philosophical disconnection from the truth of the gospel.|
|1CO 1:24|But to those who are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ is the power of God and the wisdom of God.|In this verse, the Apostle Paul contrasts the perspectives of the Jews and Greeks regarding Christ, emphasizing that He embodies both divine power and wisdom.

|1CO 1:26|Consider your calling, brothers and sisters, that not many of you were wise according to worldly standards, not many were powerful, not many were of noble birth.|This verse emphasizes the humble and lowly status of the believers in contrast to worldly wisdom and power.

The focus here is on God’s choice of the seemingly insignificant and foolish in the world to carry out His purposes.|
|1CO 1:27|But God chose what is foolish in the world to shame the wise, and God chose what is weak in the world to shame the strong.|This translation emphasizes the contrast between worldly wisdom and the divine choice of the foolish and weak.

|1CO 1:29|so that no one may boast in His presence.|This verse highlights the principle that human pride and boasting are invalid before God.
