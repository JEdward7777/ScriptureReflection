|:---------:|-------|-------------------|
|1CO 3:1|And I, brethren, could not speak to you as to spiritual people, but as to carnal, as to babes in Christ.|In this verse, the apostle Paul addresses the immaturity of the Corinthian believers, using the contrast between the spiritual and the fleshly to highlight their need for growth in Christ. The Greek words for 'spiritual' (πνευματικοῖς) and 'fleshly' (σαρκικοῖς) frame the dichotomy of maturity in faith versus the state of being influenced by worldly desires.|
|1CO 3:2|I fed you with milk and not solid food, for you were not yet able to receive it. And even now, you are still not able, for you are still worldly.|In this verse, the Apostle Paul emphasizes the spiritual immaturity of the Corinthian believers. He uses the metaphor of feeding them milk rather than solid food to illustrate their inability to digest deeper spiritual truths. The use of 'carnal' underscores the struggle with worldly desires that hinder their growth in faith.|
|1CO 3:3|For you are still worldly, since there is jealousy and strife among you. Are you not worldly? Are you not acting like mere humans?|In this verse, Paul addresses the Corinthians' divisive behavior, which stems from their immaturity and worldly mindset. The terms used for 'jealousy', 'strife', and 'divisions' reflect a state of being that is contrary to the unity expected in Christ. The phrase 'walk as mere humans' indicates a call to recognize their identity in Christ, rather than succumbing to carnal behavior.|
|1CO 3:4|For when one says, ‘I belong to Paul,’ and another says, ‘I belong to Apollos,’ are you not acting like mere humans?|In this verse, the Apostle Paul addresses the division within the church in Corinth, highlighting that identifying oneself with a particular leader leads to spiritual immaturity. The terms 'Paul' and 'Apollos' refer to well-known figures in the early church. The translation emphasizes the conflict of loyalty that results in division among believers.|
|1CO 3:5|What then is Paul? And what is Apollos? They are simply servants through whom you came to believe, each according to the role the Lord has assigned.|In this verse, Paul emphasizes the role of leaders in the church as mere servants, pointing to their function as instruments through which faith is received. The use of 'diakonos' (servant) highlights their subordinate position relative to Christ, the true source of faith and growth.|
|1CO 3:6|I planted the seed, Apollos watered it, but God is the one who caused it to grow.|This verse emphasizes the roles of Paul and Apollos in the growth of the believers, with a strong focus on God as the one who ultimately brings about growth. The use of the agricultural metaphor signifies the collaborative nature of ministry and divine intervention.|
|1CO 3:7|So neither the one who plants nor the one who waters is anything, but only God, who causes the growth.|This translation emphasizes the roles of individuals in the ministry of the Gospel while underscoring the sovereignty of God as the ultimate source of growth and success. The original Greek highlights the futility of boasting in human efforts, placing God in the central position as the one who truly increases the harvest.|
|1CO 3:8|Now he who plants and he who waters are one; but each will receive his own reward according to his own labor.|The original Greek emphasizes the unity of purpose between the one who plants and the one who waters, both of whom are essential for the growth that God provides. Each person will receive their own reward according to their individual labor, reinforcing the theme of accountability in ministry and service.|
|1CO 3:9|For we are co-workers in God’s service; you are God’s field, God’s building.|This verse emphasizes the collaborative relationship believers have with God as co-workers and the communal aspect of the church as God's field and building. The metaphors of agriculture (field) and construction (building) underscore the growth and structure of the Christian community.|
|1CO 3:10|According to the grace of God given to me, as a wise master builder, I have laid a foundation, and another builds upon it. Let each one take heed how he builds on it.|This verse highlights the importance of wise construction in the spiritual building that is the Church. The reference to the grace given to Paul underscores that this work is not done in human strength but through divine enablement. The metaphor of an architect suggests careful planning and execution in building upon the foundation of Christ.|
|1CO 3:11|For no one can lay a foundation other than that which is laid, which is Jesus Christ.|In this verse, the emphasis is on the unique and unalterable foundation laid in Christ Jesus. The phrase 'no one can lay a foundation' signifies the exclusivity of Christ as the basis of faith, reflecting the nature of salvation that cannot be supplemented or changed.|
|1CO 3:12|Now if anyone builds upon this foundation with gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, or straw,|This translation seeks to convey the importance of the materials used in building upon the foundation of Christ. The different materials symbolize the quality and permanence of one's work in the faith. The translation avoids existing phrasings to maintain freshness.|
|1CO 3:13|The quality of each person's work will become evident, for the day will reveal it; it will be tested by fire, and the fire will demonstrate what kind of work it is.|In this verse, the focus is on the day of judgment where each person's work is revealed and evaluated by fire. The imagery of fire signifies both testing and purification, highlighting the quality of one's work and its lasting value in light of eternity. The emphasis is on individual accountability before God, aligning with the broader theme of rewards for faithful service.|
|1CO 3:14|If anyone's work remains that he has built upon the foundation, he will receive a reward.|This translation emphasizes the assurance of reward for work that endures and remains steadfast, which aligns with the context of being tested by fire.|
|1CO 3:15|If anyone's work is burned up, he will suffer loss, but he himself will be saved, yet so as through fire.|This verse emphasizes the final judgment where a person's work is tested by fire, illustrating the idea that while a person may be saved, the quality of their work will determine their reward. The imagery of fire signifies both purification and judgment, where valuable work survives while lesser work is consumed.|
|1CO 3:16|Do you not realize that you are a temple of God and that the Spirit of God dwells in you?|This verse emphasizes the sacred nature of believers as the dwelling place of the Holy Spirit, highlighting their identity and responsibility. The term 'temple' is central, conveying both a physical and spiritual significance. The phrase 'the Spirit of God dwells in you' underscores the personal and communal aspect of God's presence among believers, which is crucial for understanding their collective identity as the church.|
|1CO 3:17|If anyone destroys the temple of God, God will destroy that person; for the temple of God is holy, and you are that temple.|This verse emphasizes the sacredness of the community of believers as the temple of God and warns against actions that would harm this sacred entity. The phrase 'if anyone destroys the temple' implies a serious consequence due to the divine nature of the church and its members as the dwelling place of God's Spirit.|
|1CO 3:18|Let no one deceive himself. If anyone among you thinks he is wise in this age, let him become a fool, that he may become wise.|This verse warns against self-deception regarding wisdom. It emphasizes humility and the importance of aligning one's understanding with God's truth, reflecting the theme of human folly when relying on worldly wisdom.|
|1CO 3:19|For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God. For it is written: 'He catches the wise in their own craftiness.'|This verse emphasizes the theme that human wisdom, particularly that which is rooted in worldly understanding, is foolishness in the sight of God. The phrase 'the wisdom of this world' refers to the values and principles that govern secular society, which often contradict divine wisdom. The citation from Scripture reinforces the idea that God outsmarts the 'wise' through their own cleverness.|
|1CO 3:20|And again, the Lord knows the thoughts of the wise, that they are futile.|In this translation, the term 'Lord' is used to signify God's sovereignty and knowledge. The phrase 'the thoughts of the wise' reflects the original 'dialogismous' implying not only thoughts but also plans and reasoning. The conclusion 'they are futile' emphasizes the emptiness of human wisdom compared to divine understanding.|
|1CO 3:21|So let no one boast in men, for all things are yours.|This verse emphasizes the futility of boasting in human wisdom or achievements, reminding the believers in Corinth that everything they have is a gift from God and should not lead to pride or competition among themselves.|
