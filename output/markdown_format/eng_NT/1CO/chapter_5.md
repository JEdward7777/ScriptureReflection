| Reference | Verse | Translation Notes |
|:---------:|-------|-------------------|
|1CO 5:1|It is widely reported among you that there is immorality, and such immorality as is not even named among the Gentiles, that a man has his father's wife.|This translation emphasizes the seriousness of the issue of immorality in the Corinthian church, particularly noting the specific sin that was uncommon even among the pagans.|
|1CO 5:2|And you are arrogant! Should you not rather have mourned, so that the one who has committed this deed might be removed from among you?|This verse addresses the pride of the Corinthian church in the context of a serious moral issue among them. The original language conveys a strong call for mourning over the sin present in their midst instead of boasting about their tolerance. The term 'puffed up' suggests a state of arrogance, while 'lamented' implies the appropriate emotional response to such sin.|
|1CO 5:3|For I, although absent in body but present in spirit, have already judged the one who has done this thing as though I were present.|In this verse, Paul emphasizes his authority and the seriousness of the situation concerning the immorality within the church. His phrase 'as absent in body, but present in spirit' highlights a spiritual judgment rather than a physical presence. The term 'already judged' indicates a decisive stance on the behavior that needs to be addressed.|
|1CO 5:4|In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, when you are gathered together with my spirit, along with the power of our Lord Jesus Christ,|This verse emphasizes the authority and presence of the Lord Jesus Christ during the assembly of believers, indicating the importance of His name in the context of church discipline and spiritual power.|
|1CO 5:5|Hand this man over to Satan for the destruction of the flesh, so that his spirit may be saved on the day of the Lord Jesus.|This verse emphasizes the serious consequences of sin, advocating for discipline in the church. The phrase 'hand him over to Satan' refers to excommunication for the purpose of correction and restoration, with the hope that the individual will ultimately be saved through repentance.|
|1CO 5:6|Your boasting is not good. Do you not know that a little leaven leavens the whole lump?|In this verse, Paul emphasizes the detrimental nature of pride within the church community. The metaphor of leaven is a common biblical image for sin or corrupting influence, indicating how a small amount of pride or sin can corrupt the entire community. The term 'leaven' here is used to signify that the impact of one person's arrogance can affect the entire group.|
|1CO 5:7|Clean out the old leaven, that you may be a new batch, just as you are unleavened. For Christ, our Passover, has been sacrificed for us.|This verse draws an analogy between leaven and sin, suggesting that just as a small amount of leaven can permeate an entire batch of dough, so can sin corrupt the whole community. The instruction to remove the old leaven reflects the need for purity and renewal in the church, linked to the sacrifice of Christ, who is referred to as our Passover. This emphasizes the importance of maintaining a holy and sincere lifestyle in light of Christâ€™s sacrifice.|
|1CO 5:8|Therefore, let us celebrate the feast, not with the old leaven, the leaven of malice and wickedness, but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth.|In this verse, the apostle Paul encourages the believers to celebrate with sincerity and truth rather than the corrupting influence of sin. The imagery of leaven represents sin and moral corruption, while the use of 'unleavened' signifies purity and integrity in their practice of faith. This translation seeks to convey both the call to holiness and the contrast between sin and purity, using clear and accessible language.|
|1CO 5:9|I have written to you in my letter not to associate with those who engage in sexual immorality.|In this verse, the Apostle Paul emphasizes the importance of not associating with immoral people (pornoi). This translation seeks to convey his directive with clarity while maintaining the original intent. The term 'pornoi' is consistently translated as 'fornicators' or 'immoral persons' in other texts, reflecting the broader context of moral integrity within the Christian community.|
|1CO 5:10|But I did not mean that you should completely avoid contact with those who engage in sexual immorality, or with greedy persons, or with swindlers, or with idolaters; otherwise, you would have to leave this world.|In this verse, Paul emphasizes the distinction between believers and non-believers, particularly regarding their moral conduct. The term 'world' reflects the sinful environment from which believers must separate themselves to maintain their purity in Christ.|
|1CO 5:11|But now I have written to you not to associate with anyone who claims to be a brother, yet engages in sexual immorality, greed, idolatry, slander, drunkenness, or swindling. With such a person, do not even eat.|In this verse, Paul instructs the church on how to deal with a brother who is living in sin. The focus is on the seriousness of the actions and the necessity of maintaining the integrity of the Christian community. The terms used indicate various forms of immoral behavior, and the call is clear: believers should not partake in social interactions that endorse such behaviors.|
|1CO 5:12|For what have I to do with judging those outside the church? Is it not those inside the church whom you are to judge?|In this verse, Paul emphasizes the responsibility of the church to judge those within its community rather than those outside of it. The language reflects the notion of accountability among believers.|
|1CO 5:13|But God will judge those outside. Remove the wicked person from among yourselves.|In this verse, Paul contrasts the role of God in judging those outside the faith with the responsibility of the church community to remove the immoral from among themselves. The phrase 'the wicked person' highlights the urgency and seriousness of addressing immorality within the church.|
