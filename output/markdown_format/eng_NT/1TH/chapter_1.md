|:---------:|-------|-------------------|
|1TH 1:1|Paul, Silvanus, and Timothy, to the church of the Thessalonians in God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ: Grace to you and peace.|This translation emphasizes the authorship by explicitly stating 'Paul, Silvanus, and Timothy' and their audience, the church in Thessalonica. The phrase 'in God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ' establishes the divine authority and the foundation of their greeting, while 'grace and peace' reflects a common Pauline greeting that encapsulates his blessings for the recipients.|
|1TH 1:2|We give thanks to God always for all of you, making mention of you in our prayers.|In this translation, the essence of constant gratitude and remembrance in prayer is captured. The term 'mnemē' (μνημεῖαν), which denotes remembrance, is expressed here as 'remembrance' to reflect the intention of the apostle's heart in interceding for the Thessalonians. The overall structure retains the formal tone suitable for a letter while reflecting the depth of spiritual connection.|
|1TH 1:3|We remember you constantly in our prayers before God, acknowledging your work produced by faith, your labor prompted by love, and your endurance inspired by the hope we have in our Lord Jesus Christ.|This translation emphasizes the continuous nature of Paul’s remembrance and the specific virtues he highlights: faith, love, endurance, and hope, linking them directly to their source in the Lord Jesus Christ.|
|1TH 1:4|For we know, brothers and sisters loved by God, that you are chosen by Him.|The term 'ἐκλογὴν' translates as 'chosen' or 'election', which is often associated with God's sovereign selection of individuals or groups for a particular purpose. The phrase 'ἀδελφοὶ ἠγαπημένοι ὑπὸ Θεοῦ' conveys a strong sense of divine love, indicating that the addressed are loved by God as brothers and sisters in the faith. This translation emphasizes both the affection of God and the special status of the believers in Thessalonica.|
|1TH 1:5|For our gospel came to you not simply in word, but in power and in the Holy Spirit and with deep conviction. You know how we lived among you for your sake.|In this verse, the Apostle Paul emphasizes the multifaceted nature of the gospel's impact. He notes that it is not merely through words but through the power of the Holy Spirit and assurance that the message brings about genuine transformation in the believers.|
|1TH 1:6|And you became imitators of us and of the Lord, having received the word in much affliction with joy from the Holy Spirit.|In this verse, Paul emphasizes the Thessalonians' imitation of both himself and the Lord. The mention of receiving the word in much affliction alongside joy from the Holy Spirit showcases a deep spiritual experience that transcends circumstances, highlighting the transformative power of faith even in trials.|
|1TH 1:7|So that you became a model to all the believers in Macedonia and Achaia.|The Greek term "τύποις" (typos) conveys the sense of 'models' or 'examples,' which reflects the idea of the Thessalonian believers serving as a pattern for others in faith. The use of geographical locations like Macedonia and Achaia emphasizes the broader impact of their faith beyond their immediate community.|
|1TH 1:8|For from you sounded forth the word of the Lord, not only in Macedonia and Achaia, but your faith in God has gone forth everywhere, so that we need not say anything further.|The translation seeks to capture the emphasis on the spread of the faith and its impact in various regions. The phrase 'the word of the Lord' is rendered with the intention of reflecting both its authority and its wide-reaching effect. The use of 'faith' is consistent with biblical terminology and captures the essence of the community's belief and witness.|
|1TH 1:9|For they themselves report concerning us the kind of reception we had among you, and how you turned to God from idols to serve the living and true God.|In this verse, Paul emphasizes the transformation of the Thessalonians from their previous idolatry to serving the living God. This reflects their commitment to faith and the shift in their worship. The use of 'living God' contrasts with the idols they once served, highlighting the dynamic relationship believers have with God. The phrase 'served the living and true God' is an important theological affirmation that distinguishes Christian worship from pagan practices.|
|1TH 1:10|and to wait for His Son from heaven, whom He raised from the dead, Jesus, who delivers us from the wrath to come.|This verse emphasizes the expectation of Jesus' return from heaven, highlighting His resurrection and the deliverance from impending wrath, which is a core element of Christian faith and hope. The use of the term 'wrath' draws a stark contrast between salvation and judgment, underscoring the urgency and significance of the message conveyed to the Thessalonian church.|
