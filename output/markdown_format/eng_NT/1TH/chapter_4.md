It captures the essence of the call to sanctity and devotion in everyday conduct as part of the Christian walk.|
|1TH 4:2|For you know what instructions we gave you by the authority of the Lord Jesus.|In this verse, Paul emphasizes the authoritative nature of the instructions he gave, noting that they were delivered through the authority of the Lord Jesus Christ. This underscores the significance of adhering to the teachings that the Thessalonian believers received.|
|1TH 4:3|For this is the will of God, your sanctification: that you abstain from sexual immorality.|This verse emphasizes the will of God concerning holiness and the call to abstain from sexual immorality. The term 'sanctification' indicates a process of becoming holy, which aligns with the overall biblical narrative of living a life set apart for God's purposes.|
|1TH 4:4|that each one of you should know how to control your own body in holiness and honor,|The phrase 'each of you' emphasizes individual responsibility in maintaining purity. The term 'vessel' (σκεῦος) in this context relates to how one should conduct oneself with honor and holiness. The focus on sanctification ties back to the previous verse regarding sexual immorality, stressing the need for personal integrity.|
|1TH 4:5|not in the passion of lust like the Gentiles who do not know God.|In this verse, the Apostle Paul warns against indulging in desires in the same way that the Gentiles do, who do not know God. The language highlights the distinction between believers, who should live in holiness, and those who pursue base desires without knowledge of the divine. The choice of 'passions of lust' emphasizes an uncontrolled, passionate pursuit that leads to moral degradation, contrasting with the call for self-control and holiness.|
|1TH 4:6|that no one transgress and take advantage of his brother in this matter, because the Lord is the avenger of all such, as we also forewarned you and testified.|This translation emphasizes the ethical instructions given to the Thessalonians, warning against wrongdoing in the context of interpersonal relationships among believers. The terms 'overreach' and 'defraud' capture the essence of the original Greek language, indicating both an ethical breach and a warning of divine retribution.|
|1TH 4:7|For God has not called us to impurity, but to holiness.|In this verse, the focus is on the calling of God, emphasizing that it is not towards impurity but rather towards holiness. The concept of 'holiness' (ἁγιασμῷ) is a key theme throughout the New Testament, encouraging believers to live a life set apart for God.|
|1TH 4:8|Therefore, the one who disregards this instruction does not reject a human authority, but God, who gives His Holy Spirit to you.|In this verse, Paul emphasizes that rejecting the teachings or instructions regarding moral conduct is not merely a dismissal of human authority but a rejection of God's divine authority. The inclusion of the Holy Spirit, given by God to the believers, signifies that believers are empowered to live righteously and should honor this gift in their actions.|
|1TH 4:9|Now concerning brotherly love, you do not need me to write to you, for you yourselves have been taught by God to love one another.|The term 'φιλαδελφία' refers specifically to brotherly love, emphasizing the affectionate bond among believers. This verse encourages believers by stating that they do not need further instruction on love, as they are already taught by God.|
|1TH 4:10|And indeed, you are already showing love toward all the brothers throughout Macedonia. Yet we urge you, brothers, to increase this love even more.|The verse emphasizes the call for the Thessalonian believers to excel in their love for one another, particularly towards their brothers in Macedonia. The word 'περισσεύειν' conveys the idea of overflowing or exceeding, which indicates a deep, abundant love.|
|1TH 4:11|And aspire to lead a quiet life, attending to your own business, and working with your own hands, as we instructed you.|This translation emphasizes the call to live a quiet life, take care of one's own affairs, and work with one's own hands, which aligns with the ethos of self-reliance and community responsibility prevalent in the New Testament. The use of 'to aspire' in place of 'to be ambitious' captures a more positive connotation, fitting the context of living harmoniously.|
|1TH 4:12|so that you may walk properly toward those outside and be in need of nothing.|The phrase 'eὐσχημόνως' can be translated as 'in a decent manner' or 'with honor', which emphasizes the importance of living in a way that reflects well on oneself and the community. The instruction to have 'no need of anything' relates to living a self-sufficient life that does not burden others unnecessarily.|
|1TH 4:13|But we do not want you to be uninformed, brothers, about those who have fallen asleep, so that you may not grieve as others do who have no hope.|This verse speaks to the importance of understanding the fate of those who have died, especially in the context of Christian hope. It encourages believers not to grieve as those without hope, reinforcing the significance of resurrection and eternal life through Christ.|
|1TH 4:14|For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so, God will bring with him those who have fallen asleep through Jesus.|This verse emphasizes the resurrection of Jesus as a foundation for the hope of believers concerning those who have died. The phrase 'those who have fallen asleep' refers metaphorically to death for believers, while 'God will bring with him' indicates the assurance of resurrection for those who trust in Christ. The translation seeks to maintain clarity and theological accuracy, reflecting the hope and comfort promised in Christ's resurrection.|
|1TH 4:15|For this we declare to you by the word of the Lord, that we who are alive, who remain until the coming of the Lord, will not precede those who have fallen asleep.|In this verse, Paul emphasizes the certainty of believers who remain alive at the second coming of Christ in relation to those who have died. The use of the phrase 'we who are alive' directly contrasts with 'those who have fallen asleep,' indicating the distinction between living believers and deceased ones in the context of the resurrection. The term 'presence of the Lord' signifies a profound and awaited moment of reunion.|
|1TH 4:16|For the Lord Himself will descend from heaven with a commanding shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trumpet of God; and the dead in Christ will rise first.|This translation seeks to faithfully capture the significance of the Lord's return and the resurrection of believers, utilizing terms that emphasize authority, the divine call, and the resurrection. The imagery of the archangel's voice and the trumpet call highlights the power of God's intervention in the world, signifying both judgment and hope for the faithful.|
|1TH 4:17|Then we who are alive, who remain, will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air; and thus we shall always be with the Lord.|The phrase 'harpagēsometha' is translated as 'we shall be caught up' which emphasizes the sudden and divine action of being taken to meet the Lord. The term 'in the clouds' indicates a heavenly gathering and the context suggests a joyous reunion with Christ.|
|1TH 4:18|Therefore, comfort one another with these words.|The phrase 'παρακαλεῖτε ἀλλήλους' implies a strong encouragement and mutual support among believers. This captures the essence of Christian fellowship, urging them to bolster one another's faith, especially in light of the comforting truths previously discussed about the Lord's return.|
