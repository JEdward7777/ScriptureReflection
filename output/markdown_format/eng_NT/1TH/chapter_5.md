| Reference | Verse | Translation Notes |
|:---------:|-------|-------------------|
|1TH 5:1|Now concerning the times and seasons, brothers, you have no need for anything to be written to you.|In this verse, the apostle Paul indicates that the believers do not need further instruction about the times and seasons related to the Lord's return. The terms used convey a sense of God's sovereign control over time and events. 'Chronos' refers to general time, while 'kairos' signifies specific appointed times. The translation maintains the familial address of 'brothers' to emphasize community and unity in the faith.|
|1TH 5:2|For you yourselves are well aware that the day of the Lord will come like a thief in the night.|The phrase 'the day of the Lord' refers to a future time of divine judgment and intervention. The analogy of the thief coming in the night suggests the suddenness and unexpected nature of this event.|
|1TH 5:3|When they say, ‘Peace and safety,’ then sudden destruction comes upon them, like labor pains upon a pregnant woman, and they shall not escape.|In this verse, the Apostle Paul warns of a false sense of security among people who speak of peace and safety. The imagery of sudden destruction, akin to labor pains, conveys the inevitable nature of the coming judgment that cannot be avoided. The phrase 'as labor pains' suggests that just as one cannot escape the pains of childbirth, neither can one escape the consequences of ignoring the warnings of impending doom.|
|1TH 5:4|But you, brothers, are not in darkness, so that the day should surprise you like a thief.|In this verse, Paul contrasts the believers (who are not in darkness) with those who are. The term 'darkness' represents ignorance and spiritual blindness, while 'the day' symbolizes awareness and the truth of Christ’s coming. The reference to ‘as a thief’ implies suddenness and unexpectedness, emphasizing the need for vigilance among believers.|
|1TH 5:5|For you all are children of light, children of the day. We do not belong to the night or to the darkness.|In this verse, Paul uses the imagery of light and day to contrast the believers' identity with those who dwell in darkness. The term 'sons of light' emphasizes the transformative relationship believers have with Christ, while the contrast with night and darkness highlights their moral and spiritual distinction from the world.|
|1TH 5:6|So then, let us not sleep as others do, but let us be awake and sober-minded.|In this verse, Paul contrasts the behavior of the believers with that of those who are in darkness. The emphasis is on vigilance and sobriety, both physical and spiritual. The call to 'be alert' suggests an active engagement with the world and one's faith.|
|1TH 5:7|For those who sleep, sleep at night, and those who get drunk, are drunk at night.|This verse emphasizes the contrast between the behaviors of those who are spiritually awake and alert versus those who are asleep or intoxicated. The use of 'sleep' in this context metaphorically represents spiritual lethargy and lack of awareness. Similarly, the idea of drunkenness conveys a state of impaired judgment, which is not fitting for those who are called to be vigilant and wise.|
|1TH 5:8|But since we belong to the day, let us be sober, putting on the breastplate of faith and love, and for a helmet, the hope of salvation.|This verse emphasizes the importance of spiritual vigilance and preparedness, using metaphorical language from armor to illustrate faith, love, and hope as protective elements for the believer. The metaphor of being awake during the day implies a state of alertness and readiness in the Christian life, contrasting with those who are spiritually asleep or careless.|
|1TH 5:9|For God has not destined us for wrath, but to obtain salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ.|The phrase 'for God did not appoint us to suffer wrath' emphasizes the divine intention of salvation over judgment. The term 'salvation' is related to the ongoing process of being saved, which includes the redemptive work of Christ. The context reflects the hope and assurance believers have in Christ as the source of their salvation.|
|1TH 5:10|who died for us, so that whether we are awake or asleep, we might live together with Him.|In this translation, I emphasized the significance of life and death in Christ, reflecting the central theme of hope and eternal life found in Pauline theology. The phrase 'together with Him' underscores the unity believers have with Christ in both His death and resurrection.|
|1TH 5:11|Therefore, encourage one another and build each other up, just as you are already doing.|The Greek verb 'παρακαλεῖτε' indicates an exhortation or encouragement to others, and 'οἰκοδομεῖτε' emphasizes the act of building up one another in faith. This verse highlights the community aspect of Christian life, urging believers to support and strengthen each other.|
|1TH 5:12|But we ask you, brothers and sisters, to recognize those who labor among you and are in charge of you in the Lord and who admonish you.|The translation aims to maintain the essence of Paul's encouragement to respect and acknowledge those in leadership and teaching roles within the church, focusing on their hard work and guidance.|
|1TH 5:13|and hold them in the highest regard and love because of their work. Live in peace with one another.|In this verse, the emphasis is on showing profound respect and love for those in spiritual authority due to their work. The call to live in peace with one another ties closely to the communal spirit highlighted throughout the New Testament, echoing themes found in the related verses.|
|1TH 5:14|And we urge you, brothers and sisters, to admonish those who are idle, encourage the timid, help the weak, and be patient with everyone.|In this verse, the Apostle Paul is giving specific instructions to the church in Thessalonica. The use of terms like 'admonish', 'encourage', 'support', and 'be patient' reflects the relational and communal responsibilities of believers towards each other. This translation aims to maintain the original exhortative tone while using contemporary English for clarity.|
|1TH 5:15|See that no one repays evil for evil, but always seek to do good to one another and to everyone.|This verse emphasizes the Christian principle of responding to wrongdoings with goodness rather than retaliation. It calls believers to pursue good in all their interactions, fostering a spirit of unity and love among themselves and towards all people.|
|1TH 5:16|Always rejoice.|The phrase 'always rejoice' emphasizes a continuous state of joy, reflecting a deep-seated attitude rather than a fleeting emotion. This aligns with the biblical theme of finding joy in all circumstances, as highlighted in other scripture references.|
|1TH 5:17|Pray without ceasing.|The phrase 'ἀδιαλείπτως προσεύχεσθε' translates to 'pray without ceasing.' This emphasizes a continual, persistent approach to prayer that is integrated into every moment of a believer's life.|
|1TH 5:18|In everything give thanks; for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus for you.|The original Greek emphasizes the act of gratitude in all circumstances, underlining its significance as God's will for believers. The translation maintains the imperative form of the original, which encourages constant gratitude as a spiritual practice.|
|1TH 5:19|Do not extinguish the Spirit.|The phrase 'τὸ Πνεῦμα μὴ σβέννυτε' translates literally to 'Do not quench the Spirit.' In this context, 'quench' refers to the act of suppressing or extinguishing the work and presence of the Holy Spirit in believers' lives. This admonition emphasizes the importance of allowing the Spirit to guide and influence one’s actions and attitudes, particularly in the context of worship and community life.|
|1TH 5:20|Do not despise prophetic utterances.|In this translation, the term 'prophecy' is retained to reflect the importance of the prophetic gift within the early Church. The word 'despise' is used to convey a strong sense of disregard that the original Greek word carries. This translation aims to maintain the exhortation's urgency while ensuring clarity for modern readers.|
|1TH 5:21|But test all things; hold fast to what is good.|In this verse, the call to 'test' or 'prove' emphasizes the need for discernment in the Christian life, particularly in the context of prophetic messages. The term 'good' underscores the importance of holding fast to what aligns with God's will and character.|
|1TH 5:22|Abstain from every form of evil.|This verse emphasizes the need to distance oneself from all forms of evil. The phrase 'from every kind of evil' suggests a complete rejection rather than a mere avoidance, aligning with the moral exhortation present throughout Scripture to live righteously and pursue good.|
|1TH 5:23|Now may the God of peace Himself sanctify you completely, and may your whole spirit, soul, and body be preserved blameless at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.|In this translation, the focus is on the completeness and wholeness of the believer's spirit, soul, and body, emphasizing the importance of holiness and being preserved blameless until the return of Christ. The Greek term 'ὁλοτελεῖς' conveys the sense of being fully and perfectly sanctified.|
|1TH 5:24|Faithful is He who calls you, who also will accomplish it.|This translation captures the essence of the original Greek text, emphasizing the reliability of the one who calls and His commitment to fulfill His promises. The phrase 'who also will do it' signifies that God is not only the caller but also the one who actively brings about the fulfillment of His call in the lives of believers.|
|1TH 5:25|Brothers, pray for us.|The command to pray for one another emphasizes the communal aspect of faith and mutual support in the Christian community. This verse is a straightforward request for prayer, reflecting the importance of intercession among believers.|
|1TH 5:26|Greet all the brothers with a holy embrace.|The phrase 'holy kiss' signifies a greeting of affection and brotherly love, representative of the unity and sanctity expected among believers. The term 'brothers' extends to all members of the Christian community, emphasizing familial bonds in faith.|
|1TH 5:27|I solemnly charge you before the Lord to have this letter read to all the holy brothers.|The original Greek verb 'ὁρκίζω' translates to 'I urge' or 'I charge', indicating a strong exhortation. 'Κύριον' refers to 'the Lord', establishing authority behind the request. 'ἀναγνωσθῆναι' conveys the idea of being read aloud, emphasizing public acknowledgment. 'ἐπιστολὴν' means 'letter', and 'ἁγίοις ἀδελφοῖς' translates to 'holy brothers', underscoring the communal aspect of faith among believers. This verse thus carries a strong appeal for unity and communal recognition among the members of the faith community.|
|1TH 5:28|The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you. Amen.|In this translation, 'grace' is emphasized as a blessing from the Lord, indicating a heartfelt wish for divine favor to be with the readers.
