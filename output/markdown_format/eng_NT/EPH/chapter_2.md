| Reference | Verse | Translation Notes |
|:---------:|-------|-------------------|
|EPH 2:1|And you were dead in your transgressions and sins,|In this verse, the term 'dead' is used metaphorically to describe a state of spiritual separation from God due to sins and transgressions. This underscores the transformation that occurs when one accepts faith in Christ, moving from death to life.|
|EPH 2:2|in which you once walked, following the course of this world, following the prince of the power of the air, the spirit that is now at work in the sons of disobedience;|This verse emphasizes the spiritual state of believers prior to their salvation, highlighting their previous alignment with the world and the influence of evil spiritual forces. The terminology is consistent with Paul’s portrayal of spiritual realities, contrasting the life of faith with the previous bondage to sin and darkness.|
|EPH 2:3|Among them, we all once lived in the passions of our flesh, fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind, and were by nature children of wrath, like the rest of mankind.|This verse reflects the sinful condition of humanity prior to salvation, emphasizing the role of our fleshly desires and thoughts that lead to disobedience. The terms 'desires' and 'children of wrath' convey the concept of inherent sinfulness that results in divine judgment.|
|EPH 2:4|But God, being rich in mercy, because of the great love with which He loved us.|This verse emphasizes God's abundant mercy and love toward humanity, which is a key theme in Paul's letter to the Ephesians. The words 'rich' and 'mercy' suggest a depth and generosity in God's character, inviting believers to understand the foundation of their salvation and relationship with God. The phrase 'great love' highlights the intensity of God's affection for us, which ultimately leads to our salvation.|
|EPH 2:5|even when we were dead in our trespasses, He made us alive together with Christ; by grace you have been saved.|In this verse, the phrase 'made alive' captures the transformation from spiritual death to life through Christ. The use of 'grace' emphasizes that this salvation is a gift and not something earned, aligning with the theological theme present in Ephesians of salvation by grace.|
|EPH 2:6|and He raised us up with Him and seated us with Him in the heavenly places in Christ Jesus,|This verse emphasizes the profound spiritual reality that believers are raised and exalted with Christ in the heavenly realm. The verbs 'raised' and 'seated' highlight the transformation and new position believers occupy in relation to Christ, reinforcing the theme of union with Him. 'Heavenly places' conveys a sense of the divine realm where Christ currently reigns.|
|EPH 2:7|so that in the coming ages He might show the immeasurable riches of His grace in kindness toward us in Christ Jesus.|This verse highlights God's purpose in displaying His grace and kindness to humanity throughout eternity, emphasizing the abundance of His grace toward us in Christ Jesus.|
|EPH 2:8|For by grace you have been saved through faith; and this is not of yourselves; it is the gift of God.|The original text emphasizes that salvation is not a result of our own efforts, but rather a gift from God, underscoring the central Christian doctrine of grace and faith. The phrase 'through faith' indicates the means by which we receive salvation, while 'not of yourselves' asserts that it is entirely God's doing.|
|EPH 2:9|not of works, so that no one may boast.|The phrase 'not of works' emphasizes that salvation is not something we earn through our own efforts or achievements. The Greek word 'ἔργων' (ergon) specifically refers to deeds or actions, underlining that the believer cannot boast about their salvation as it is entirely a result of God's grace.|
|EPH 2:10|For we are His masterpiece, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared beforehand so that we may walk in them.|This translation emphasizes the fact that believers are created by God for the purpose of doing good works that He has already planned for them. It reflects the intimate connection between our identity in Christ and the works we are called to perform, highlighting the grace of God that transforms us into His handiwork.|
|EPH 2:11|Therefore, remember that formerly you, who are Gentiles by birth and called 'uncircumcised' by those who call themselves 'the circumcised' (which is done in the flesh by human hands),|In this translation, I aim to reflect the apostle Paul's emphasis on the contrast between the Gentiles and the Jewish people regarding their spiritual status. The term 'uncircumcised' refers to Gentiles, while 'circumcision' symbolizes the covenant relationship of the Jewish people with God. The phrase 'in the flesh' underlines the physical aspect of their identities at the time, stressing the separation between Jews and Gentiles before the redemptive work of Christ.|
|EPH 2:12|remember that at that time you were without Christ, excluded from the citizenship of Israel, and strangers to the covenants of promise, having no hope and without God in the world.|This verse emphasizes the separation of the Gentiles from the promises of God prior to their inclusion in Christ. Key terms include 'without Christ,' 'aliens,' and 'having no hope,' which reflect a state of estrangement from God's covenant people and His promises.|
|EPH 2:13|But now in Christ Jesus, you who once were far away have been brought near by the blood of Christ.|This translation captures the essence of the original Greek while maintaining clarity and coherence in English. The phrase 'those who were once far off' emphasizes the distance from God due to sin, while 'made near' indicates reconciliation through the sacrificial act of Christ.|
|EPH 2:14|For He Himself is our peace, who has made both one and has broken down the middle wall of separation.|This verse emphasizes that Jesus is not only the means of reconciliation between God and humanity, but also the unifying force between Jews and Gentiles, breaking down barriers that separate them. The term 'peace' indicates a deep sense of wholeness and unity, which is a central theme in the message of the Gospel.|
|EPH 2:15|Abolishing in His flesh the hostility that is the law of commandments contained in ordinances, so that He might create in Himself one new man from the two, thus establishing peace.|This verse emphasizes the unity and reconciliation that Christ has achieved through His sacrifice. The term 'hostility' reflects the enmity that existed due to the Law, which has now been nullified, allowing for the creation of a new identity in Christ.|
|EPH 2:16|and might reconcile both of them into one body to God through the cross, having slain the enmity in Himself.|In this verse, the concept of reconciliation is emphasized, highlighting the role of Christ in uniting both Jews and Gentiles into one body. The imagery of the cross is crucial, as it signifies the removal of hostility and the establishment of a new relationship with God.|
|EPH 2:17|And coming, He proclaimed peace to you who were far off and peace to those who were near.|In this verse, Paul emphasizes the duality of the message of peace brought by Christ, reaching both those who are far off and those who are near, reflecting the universal reach of the Gospel.|
|EPH 2:18|For through Him, we both have access by one Spirit to the Father.|The phrase 'we have access' captures the idea of approaching or coming near to God through Christ. The use of 'both' emphasizes the inclusion of all believers, whether Jew or Gentile, uniting them in one Spirit. 'To the Father' indicates the direct relationship we now have with God, made possible by Jesus' sacrifice.|
|EPH 2:19|Consequently, you are no longer strangers and foreigners, but fellow citizens with the saints and members of God's household.|This translation emphasizes the shift from being outsiders to becoming part of the household of God, aligning with the themes of inclusion and belonging present in Paul's letters.|
|EPH 2:20|built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, with Christ Jesus himself being the cornerstone.|In this translation, the term 'built upon' conveys the idea of a continual process of construction, emphasizing the believers’ active role in the church, with the foundation being explicitly identified with the apostles and prophets. The cornerstone reference to Jesus Christ highlights His critical and foundational role in the church's structure.|
|EPH 2:21|In whom the whole building, being fitted together, grows into a holy temple in the Lord.|This translation captures the essence of the original Greek text, focusing on the collective growth and the sacred nature of the building, which is the church, in connection with the Lord. The term 'grows' signifies a continual process of development in spiritual unity and purpose.|
|EPH 2:22|In Him you are also being built together into a dwelling place for God by the Spirit.|The phrase 'in whom' refers back to Christ as the cornerstone of the building that is being constructed, which is a metaphor for the church. The verb 'συνοικοδομεῖσθε' indicates a communal and cooperative action in building up the church. The term 'κατοικητήριον' emphasizes the aspect of God making His dwelling among His people through the Holy Spirit.|
