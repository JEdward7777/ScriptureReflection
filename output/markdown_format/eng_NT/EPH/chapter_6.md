| Reference | Verse | Translation Notes |
|:---------:|-------|-------------------|
|EPH 6:1|Children, obey your parents in the Lord, for this is right.|This translation aims to reflect the direct address to children, emphasizing their responsibility to obey their parents in a way that aligns with the Christian doctrine of respect and duty within familial relationships. The phrase 'in the Lord' indicates that this obedience is not merely societal but a spiritual obligation as well.|
|EPH 6:2|Honor your father and your mother, which is the first commandment with a promise.|In this verse, the directive to honor one's parents is presented as not just a moral guideline but as the first commandment with a promise. The word 'first' implies priority, and 'promise' suggests a divine assurance of well-being in response to honoring one's parents.|
|EPH 6:3|so that it may go well with you, and you may live long on the earth.|This verse emphasizes the blessings of obeying the command to honor one's parents, correlating directly with the promise of a long life in the land given by God.|
|EPH 6:4|And fathers, do not provoke your children to anger, but bring them up in the instruction and discipline of the Lord.|The verse emphasizes the dual responsibility of fathers in parenting: to avoid provoking their children to anger while also nurturing them in the teachings and discipline of the Lord. The word 'παροργίζετε' (parorgizete) suggests a strong warning against causing unnecessary anger or resentment in children, while 'ἐκτρέφετε' (ektrephete) indicates a positive nurturing and upbringing.|
|EPH 6:5|Servants, obey your earthly masters with respect and fear, and with a sincere heart, just as you would obey Christ.|This verse emphasizes the attitude of servants towards their masters, underscoring obedience and reverence. The terms 'fear' and 'trembling' convey a deep respect, while 'singleness of heart' suggests a sincere and undivided commitment, much like one would show towards Christ.|
|EPH 6:6|Not by way of eye-service, as people-pleasers, but as servants of Christ, doing the will of God from the heart.|In this verse, the focus is on the motivation behind actions, emphasizing sincerity and service to Christ rather than mere human approval. The terms reflect the contrast between being outwardly compliant for appearance's sake versus genuinely serving God with the heart.|
|EPH 6:7|Serve with goodwill, as to the Lord and not to men.|In this translation, I have focused on conveying the intent of serving sincerely and with goodwill as one would serve the Lord rather than men. The term 'with goodwill' is an essential addition to capture the essence of 'μετ᾽ εὐνοίας.'|
|EPH 6:8|Knowing that whatever good anyone does, this he will receive back from the Lord, whether he is a bondservant or free.|The verse emphasizes the certainty of divine reward for good deeds, irrespective of social status. The terms 'servant' and 'free' underscore the equality before God in the realm of ethics and morality.|
|EPH 6:9|And masters, treat your servants in the same way, refraining from threats, knowing that both they and you have a Master in heaven, and there is no favoritism with Him.|This verse emphasizes the equal standing of both masters and servants before God. The concept of 'impartiality' is critical here, underscoring that the Lord does not favor one over another based on earthly status. The exhortation for masters to treat their servants justly links back to the previous verse's theme of reciprocal justice and reward for good deeds.|
|EPH 6:10|Finally, my brothers, be strengthened in the Lord and in the power of His might.|This verse emphasizes the need for spiritual strength derived from the Lord. The original Greek uses 'ἐνδυναμοῦσθε,' which is a call to empower oneself through God's might. This fresh translation seeks to capture both the communal aspect (addressing 'brothers') and the source of strength (the Lord's power).|
|EPH 6:11|Put on the full armor of God, so that you may be able to stand against the schemes of the devil.|The phrase 'put on the whole armor of God' is rendered to emphasize both the completeness of the armor and the divine source. The term 'schemes' is used for 'μεθοδείας' to convey the strategic nature of the devil's attacks.|
|EPH 6:12|For we do not wrestle against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the authorities, against the cosmic powers of this present darkness, against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly places.|In this verse, Paul emphasizes that our struggle is not against physical beings (flesh and blood) but against spiritual entities. The terms used (such as 'rulers', 'authorities', and 'spiritual forces') align with the biblical concept of unseen battles against evil powers. The use of 'darkness' symbolizes the spiritual state of opposition to God. This fresh translation aims to encapsulate these themes while being clear and understandable in English.|
|EPH 6:13|Therefore, take up the whole armor of God, so that you may be able to withstand in the evil day, and having done all, to stand firm.|This verse emphasizes the necessity of spiritual preparation and readiness to withstand evil, as well as the importance of divine protection. The phrase 'the armor of God' indicates that believers are equipped with God’s provision to face spiritual challenges, while the 'evil day' refers to times of temptation and trial. The wording 'having done all' suggests a sense of perseverance in the face of these challenges.|
|EPH 6:14|Stand therefore, having girded your waist with truth, and having put on the breastplate of righteousness.|The Greek phrase 'περιζωσάμενοι τὴν ὀσφὺν' suggests a readiness and preparation, akin to a soldier fastening a belt to ready himself for battle. The 'θώρακα τῆς δικαιοσύνης' metaphorically represents a protective covering, emphasizing righteousness as a defense in spiritual warfare.|
|EPH 6:15|And having fitted your feet with the readiness that comes from the gospel of peace,|The phrase 'having shod your feet' conveys the idea of readiness and preparation, particularly in the context of sharing the gospel. The term 'gospel of peace' indicates both the message of salvation and the tranquility that comes from faith. This verse is integral to the overall message of standing firm in spiritual warfare, emphasizing the importance of readiness to spread the good news of Christ's peace.|
|EPH 6:16|In addition to all this, take up the shield of faith, with which you will be able to extinguish all the fiery darts of the wicked one.|This verse emphasizes the defensive aspect of faith, likening it to a shield that protects against the attacks of the evil one. The term "fiery darts" metaphorically refers to the various temptations and assaults faced by believers, which faith can extinguish.|
|EPH 6:17|And take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the Spirit, which is the Word of God.|The imagery in this verse connects to the concepts of protection and spiritual warfare found throughout scripture. The 'helmet of salvation' symbolizes the assurance of salvation, while 'the sword of the Spirit' represents the Word of God as both an offensive and defensive tool in spiritual conflict. It is important to maintain the emphasis on the action of taking up these elements as part of the believer's armor in Christ.|
|EPH 6:18|Praying at all times in the Spirit, with all prayer and supplication. To that end, keep alert with all perseverance, making supplication for all the saints.|This verse emphasizes the importance of persistent and Spirit-led prayer. The phrase 'in the Spirit' indicates that our prayers should be aligned with the will of the Holy Spirit, while 'keeping alert' suggests vigilance and watchfulness, essential for spiritual warfare. Additionally, 'with all perseverance' stresses the need for continual effort and dedication in prayer, particularly for the saints, highlighting the communal aspect of prayer within the body of Christ.|
|EPH 6:19|And pray for me, that whenever I open my mouth, words may be given to me so that I will fearlessly make known the mystery of the gospel.|In this verse, the Apostle Paul requests prayer for the boldness to proclaim the gospel clearly. The terms 'λόγος' (word) and 'παρρησία' (boldness) are key, reflecting both the message and the manner in which it is delivered. The phrase 'το μυστήριον τοῦ εὐαγγελίου' indicates that the gospel was once a mystery but has now been revealed, thus emphasizing its importance and urgency in proclamation.|
|EPH 6:20|for which I am an ambassador in chains, so that in it I may declare it boldly, as I ought to speak.|The phrase 'I am an ambassador in chains' emphasizes Paul's role as a representative of Christ, even while imprisoned. The request for boldness highlights the importance of speaking God's truth without fear, and the necessity of divine support in such a task.|
|EPH 6:21|But so that you may also know about my circumstances and what I am doing, Tychicus, the beloved brother and faithful minister in the Lord, will make everything known to you.|In this verse, Paul emphasizes Tychicus's role as a messenger and a faithful minister in the Lord, reinforcing the theme of community and shared mission in Christ. The original Greek uses terms that highlight Tychicus's affection and reliability, which is crucial for conveying Paul's thoughts to the Ephesians.|
|EPH 6:22|I have sent him to you for this very purpose, so that you may know about our circumstances and that he may encourage your hearts.|In this verse, the emphasis is on sending Tychicus to provide comfort and knowledge to the believers about Paul's situation, reflecting a caring pastoral concern. The Greek terms for 'know' and 'comfort' highlight the importance of both knowledge of circumstances and encouragement for the heart.|
|EPH 6:23|Peace be with the brothers, and love with faith from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.|In this verse, Paul emphasizes the blessings of peace and love that come from God the Father and Jesus Christ. The term 'ἀδελφοῖς' ('brethren') reflects a deep familial bond among Christians, while 'ἀγάπη' ('love') coupled with 'πίστεως' ('faith') suggests a strong relationship founded in shared belief. The use of 'εἰρήνη' ('peace') is common in Pauline greetings and is intended to convey spiritual tranquility and harmony within the community.|
|EPH 6:24|Grace be with all who love our Lord Jesus Christ with an imperishable love. Amen.|In this translation, I have emphasized the connection between grace and love for the Lord, aligning with the overall themes of affection and loyalty expressed throughout the epistle. The term 'immortality' is rendered here as 'imperishability' to highlight the eternal aspect of the believers' love for Christ.|
