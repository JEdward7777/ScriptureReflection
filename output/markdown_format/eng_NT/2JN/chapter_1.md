|2JN 1:1|The elder to the chosen lady and her children, whom I love in truth—and not I only, but also all who know the truth,|In this verse, the term 'the elder' signifies a leader or teacher in the church. 'Chosen lady' is a metaphorical reference to a congregation or church community, while 'children' refers to the members of that community. The expression of love 'in truth' emphasizes the importance of genuine affection grounded in the reality of God's truth. The mention of 'all who know the truth' signifies unity among believers in their shared understanding of the gospel.|
|2JN 1:2|because of the truth that abides in us, and will be with us forever.|This translation emphasizes the enduring nature of the truth that resides in believers and the promise of its eternal presence with them. It is drawn from the themes of love and truth prevalent in the Johannine writings, reflecting both the assurance of God’s presence and the community aspect of faith.|
|2JN 1:3|Grace, mercy, and peace will be with us from God the Father and from Jesus Christ, the Son of the Father, in truth and love.|The verse emphasizes the blessings of grace, mercy, and peace from God the Father and Jesus Christ. The terms 'grace' (χάρις), 'mercy' (ἔλεος), and 'peace' (εἰρήνη) are common themes in the New Testament, often reflecting God's relational attributes toward believers. The phrase 'from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ' establishes the source of these blessings, underlining the unity of God and Christ in the Christian faith.|
|2JN 1:4|I rejoiced greatly that I found some of your children walking in truth, just as we received commandment from the Father.|This verse expresses the joy of the writer upon discovering that his spiritual children are living according to the truth. The emphasis is on the relationship between obedience to God's commandments and the practice of truth in life. The translation seeks to capture the joy and the strong connection to both truth and the divine command received from the Father.|
|2JN 1:5|And now I ask you, dear lady, not as if I were writing you a new command, but the one we have had from the beginning, that we love one another.|In this verse, the author emphasizes the importance of loving one another, framing it not as a new commandment but as a continuation of a principle that has existed since the beginning. This reflects a central theme of New Testament teaching on love and community among believers.|
|2JN 1:6|And this is love: that we walk according to His commandments. This is the commandment, as you have heard from the beginning, that you should walk in it.|In this verse, the concept of love is directly tied to obedience to God's commandments, emphasizing the importance of living in accordance with His instructions as a demonstration of love. The term 'walk' (περιπατῶμεν) suggests an ongoing action, representing a lifestyle rather than a one-time act.|
|2JN 1:7|For many deceivers have gone out into the world, those who do not confess Jesus Christ as coming in the flesh. This is a deceiver and the Antichrist.|In this verse, the emphasis is placed on the presence of deceivers who do not confess Jesus Christ as coming in the flesh. The term 'deceivers' reflects the Greek term 'πλάνοι,' emphasizing the intention to mislead others regarding the true nature of Christ. The word 'Antichrist' (Ἀντίχριστος) is used to identify those who oppose Christ directly. The structure maintains the warning tone present in the original text while ensuring clarity for contemporary readers.|
|2JN 1:8|Watch yourselves, so that you may not lose what we have worked for, but may receive a full reward.|The verse emphasizes the importance of vigilance in one's spiritual walk, ensuring that the work done for Christ is not lost but rewarded. The language here stresses both personal responsibility and the encouragement to remain steadfast in faith and good works, echoing themes found in other New Testament writings.|
|2JN 1:9|Everyone who goes ahead and does not abide in the teaching of Christ does not have God; whoever abides in the teaching has both the Father and the Son.|This verse emphasizes the importance of remaining in the teachings of Christ. The phrase 'abiding' reflects a continuous, active engagement with the doctrine of Christ, which is essential for true communion with God. The verse contrasts those who violate this teaching with those who remain steadfast in it, thereby enjoying a relationship with both the Father and the Son.|
|2JN 1:10|If anyone comes to you and does not bring this teaching, do not receive him into your house or give him any greeting.|This verse warns against accepting anyone who does not uphold the teachings of Christ into one's home, reflecting a broader principle of maintaining doctrinal purity within the Christian community. The use of 'receiving' and 'greeting' here emphasizes the importance of not just acceptance but endorsement of false teachings.|
|2JN 1:11|For whoever greets him shares in his wicked works.|This translation maintains the emphasis on the consequences of extending greetings or hospitality to those who promote evil works, highlighting the connection between one's words and actions in a spiritual context.|
|2JN 1:12|Though I have many things to write to you, I did not wish to do so with pen and ink; instead, I hope to come to you and speak face to face, that our joy may be complete.|The original Greek text expresses a desire for direct and personal communication rather than written correspondence. The phrase ' στόμα πρὸς στόμα' ('face to face') indicates a longing for personal fellowship that goes beyond mere words. The joy mentioned reflects the mutual encouragement that comes from such direct relationships among believers.|
|2JN 1:13|The children of your chosen sister greet you. Amen.|The verse conveys a sense of warmth and connection, emphasizing the importance of relationships within the Christian community, particularly highlighting the idea of family in faith. The term 'children' is symbolic of spiritual kinship and love, reflecting the teaching of Christ about our identities as part of God's family.|
