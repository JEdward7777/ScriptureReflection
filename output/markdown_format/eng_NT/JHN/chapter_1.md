|:---------:|-------|-------------------|
|JHN 1:1|In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.|The translation maintains the emphasis on the preexistence of 'the Word' (Λόγος), its divine relationship with God (Θεόν), and its essential nature as God (Θεὸς). The structure reflects the original Greek syntax to preserve theological implications regarding the Trinity and the deity of Christ.|
|JHN 1:2|He was in the beginning with God.|This translation maintains the emphasis on the pre-existence of the Word, highlighting its presence with God from the very beginning. The phrase 'in the beginning' echoes the creation narrative in Genesis, affirming the eternal relationship between the Word and God.|
|JHN 1:3|All things came into being through Him, and without Him not even one thing was made that has been made.|This verse emphasizes the role of the Word (the Logos) in creation, indicating that everything came into being through Him. The negation used ('οὐδὲ ἓν') highlights that nothing was created without Him, underlining His central importance in the act of creation.|
|JHN 1:4|In Him was life, and that life was the light for humanity.|The phrase 'in Him was life' emphasizes the source of life found in Christ. The second clause 'and the life was the light of men' illustrates the transformative power of this life, highlighting the relationship between spiritual life and illumination. The word 'light' signifies guidance and truth in a dark world.|
|JHN 1:5|And the light shines in the darkness, and the darkness did not overpower it.|The phrase 'the light shines in the darkness' suggests a continual presence of light despite the existence of darkness. The term 'darkness' represents spiritual ignorance or evil, while the phrase 'did not overcome it' implies a defeat of darkness by light, emphasizing the ultimate victory of divine truth.|
|JHN 1:6|There came a man sent from God, whose name was John.|This translation emphasizes the divine commission of John the Baptist, aligning with the original Greek structure and intent. The term 'sent' reflects John's role as a messenger from God, and 'man' emphasizes his humanity.|
|JHN 1:7|He came as a witness, to bear witness about the Light, so that all might believe through him.|This verse emphasizes John the Baptist's role as a witness to the true Light, which is Christ. The use of 'witness' (μαρτυρία) indicates the importance of testifying to the truth and encouraging faith in Jesus as the Messiah. The phrase 'that all might believe through him' underscores the evangelistic purpose of John's ministry.|
|JHN 1:8|He was not the light, but came to bear witness concerning the light.|In this verse, the distinction between the witness and the Light itself is emphasized. The witness (John the Baptist) is not the Light, but his purpose is to testify about the true Light, which is Christ. The structure of the Greek highlights the contrast between John and the Light, and the phrase 'so that' indicates the intention behind his testimony.|
|JHN 1:9|The true light that gives light to everyone was coming into the world.|In this translation, the emphasis is placed on the nature of the light as 'true' and its illuminating power over all humanity, reflecting the intention of the original Greek text.|
|JHN 1:10|He was in the world, and though the world was made through him, the world did not recognize him.|In this verse, the emphasis is on the world's existence in relation to the Word, the rejection by the world, and the implication of ignorance towards its Creator. The terms 'world' (κόσμος) and 'made' (ἐγένετο) are critical in highlighting both the creative act and the subsequent failure to recognize the Creator. The use of 'knew' (ἔγνω) indicates a deeper relational understanding that was absent.|
|JHN 1:11|He came to his own, and his own people did not receive him.|The Greek term 'ἴδια' refers to one's own or to that which belongs to oneself. In this context, it highlights the idea of Jesus coming to His own people—those who should have recognized Him as their own. The phrase 'οἱ ἴδιοι' directly translates to 'his own,' emphasizing the rejection by those closest to Him.|
|JHN 1:12|But to all who received him, he gave the authority to become children of God, to those who believe in his name.|This translation aims to preserve the essence of the original Greek while ensuring clarity for the modern reader. The phrase 'authority to become' is an interpretation of the Greek 'ἔδωκεν αὐτοῖς ἐξουσίαν', which emphasizes both the act of receiving and the bestowed right or power.|
|JHN 1:13|who were not born of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God.|The phrase 'not of bloods' indicates a rejection of natural lineage or ethnic heritage as the means of becoming children of God. The expressions regarding the will of flesh and man emphasize that human desires or efforts are insufficient for spiritual rebirth. This aligns with the doctrine of divine regeneration, where believers are born of God, emphasizing the supernatural act of God in the process of salvation.|
|JHN 1:14|And the Word became flesh and dwelt among us, and we beheld His glory, the glory as of the only begotten from the Father, full of grace and truth.|This translation captures the essence of the Incarnation, emphasizing both the humanity of Christ ('the Word became flesh') and the divine nature ('full of grace and truth'). It also reflects on the glory of the only Son as recognized by His disciples.|

The phrase 'He who comes after me' signifies both a chronological and a hierarchical distinction, as John asserts that Jesus is pre-eminent even though He appears after him in ministry.|
|JHN 1:16|And from His fullness we have all received, and grace upon grace.|This translation captures the essence of receiving grace from Christ, highlighting the abundance of His fullness. The term 'grace' (χάριν) is emphasized in relation to the continuous flow of divine favor from Christ to believers.|
|JHN 1:17|For the law was given through Moses; grace and truth came into being through Jesus Christ.|In this verse, 'law' signifies the divine commandments given through Moses, while 'grace' and 'truth' refer to the embodiment of God's unmerited favor and ultimate reality as revealed through Jesus Christ. This contrasts the old covenant with the new covenant established in Christ.|
|JHN 1:18|No one has ever seen God; the only begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, He has declared Him.|This verse emphasizes the unique role of Jesus Christ as the only Son who has made God known.

The phrase 'in the bosom of the Father' suggests an intimate and unique connection.|
|JHN 1:19|And this is the testimony of John, when the Jews sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem to ask him, 'Who are you?'|In this verse, the term 'μαρτυρία' (testimony) reflects the importance of witness in the Gospel of John, highlighting the role of John the Baptist as a forerunner. The phrase 'ἀπέστειλαν' (sent) indicates a formal inquiry by the Jewish leaders, emphasizing their authority and the significance of John's mission.

This fresh translation captures John's affirmation and humility, which are central to his role as the forerunner of Christ.|
|JHN 1:21|And they asked him, 'What then? Are you Elijah?' And he said, 'I am not.' 'Are you the Prophet?' And he answered, 'No.'|The question posed to John the Baptist highlights the anticipation of the return of Elijah as a significant prophetic figure in Jewish expectation. John's emphatic denial serves to clarify his role and identity in relation to the coming Messiah, reflecting the prophetic tradition and the expectation surrounding it.|
|JHN 1:22|So they said to him, 'Who are you? Tell us, so that we can give an answer to those who sent us. What do you say about yourself?'|The Greek phrase 'τίς εἶ' translates directly as 'who are you?' The structure of the question indicates a formal inquiry into John’s identity. The addition of 'in order that we may give an answer to those who sent us' emphasizes the accountability to the sending authority, maintaining the context of the inquiry and the importance of John's response regarding his identity.|
|JHN 1:23|He said, 'I am the voice of one crying out in the wilderness, ‘Make straight the way of the Lord,’ as said by the prophet Isaiah.'|This verse references Isaiah's prophetic declaration, highlighting John the Baptist's role in preparing the way for the coming of the Lord.

The term 'standing among you' indicates Jesus’ physical presence, adding to the urgency of John's message.|
|JHN 1:27|It is He who comes after me, who was before me; I am not worthy to untie the strap of His sandal.|This verse emphasizes John's humility in comparison to the coming Messiah, asserting that he is not even worthy to perform the most menial task of loosening the sandal of Jesus. The use of 'come after me' and 'come before me' illustrates the preeminence of Christ, despite John's role as a forerunner.|
