| Reference | Verse | Translation Notes |
|:---------:|-------|-------------------|
|JHN 9:1|As Jesus was passing by, He saw a man who had been blind from birth.|In this verse, the phrase 'blind from birth' conveys both the physical condition of the man and his life situation. The word 'seeing' refers not only to physical sight but also to the spiritual perception that follows throughout the chapter. This is critical in understanding the miracle and its implications in the narrative.|
|JHN 9:2|And His disciples asked Him, saying, "Rabbi, who sinned, this man or his parents, that he was born blind?"|In this verse, the disciples question Jesus about the cause of the man’s blindness, displaying a common belief in the relationship between sin and suffering in their culture. The use of the term 'sin' is significant, as it reflects a theological understanding of punishment and familial consequences in biblical teachings.|
|JHN 9:3|Jesus answered, "Neither this man nor his parents sinned, but this happened so that the works of God might be displayed in him."|This verse emphasizes that the man's blindness is not a direct consequence of sin but rather serves a greater purpose: to reveal the works of God. The use of 'to reveal' indicates an unveiling or manifestation, reflecting God's power and glory in circumstances that may seem negative or unjust to human perception.|
|JHN 9:4|I must work the works of Him who sent me while it is day; night is coming when no one can work.|In this translation, I have aimed to capture the urgency and significance of Jesus' mission, emphasizing the need to work while the opportunity lasts. The concept of 'day' symbolizes the time allotted for doing God's work, and 'night' represents a time when such work will no longer be possible.|
|JHN 9:5|As long as I am in the world, I am the light of the world.|In this verse, Jesus asserts his identity as the light of the world, emphasizing his role in dispelling darkness and bringing spiritual illumination to humanity. The phrase ‘light of the world’ serves to highlight his divine mission and the transformational power of his presence.|
|JHN 9:6|Having said these things, He spat on the ground, made clay with the saliva, and anointed the blind man's eyes with the clay.|This verse emphasizes the act of creation and healing performed by Jesus. The use of clay (πηλὸν) resonates with the imagery of God creating man from the dust, and the act of anointing the blind man’s eyes is a demonstration of Jesus’ authority and power to restore sight. The gesture of spitting and making clay can be seen as a significant and intimate act of restoration.|
|JHN 9:7|He said to him, "Go, wash in the Pool of Siloam," which is translated as 'Sent.' So he went and washed, and came back seeing.|In this verse, the action of washing in the Pool of Siloam is significant not only for physical healing but also carries spiritual implications of obedience and faith. The term 'Siloam' translates to 'Sent,' linking the act of the man's healing to the broader theme of being sent by Jesus for a purpose.|
|JHN 9:8|Therefore, the neighbors and those who had seen him previously as a beggar said, "Is this not the man who used to sit and beg?"|The original Greek structure emphasizes the recognition of the formerly blind man by his neighbors. The term 'begging' used here reflects the social condition of the blind in that time, often reliant on the mercy of others. The translation captures the surprise and disbelief of the witnesses as they question whether this is truly the man they knew before his healing.|
|JHN 9:9|Some said, "This is the man." Others said, "No, but he is like him." But he himself declared, "I am he."|In this verse, the varying opinions about the identity of the man who was healed are emphasized. The phrase 'ἐγώ εἰμι' ('I am') indicates a strong affirmation of identity, connecting to the larger theme of self-revelation present in the Gospel of John.|
|JHN 9:10|So they asked him, 'How were your eyes opened?'|This verse reflects the astonishment and curiosity of those witnessing the miracle of the blind man's healing. The use of the word 'opened' here signifies the miraculous nature of his sight being restored. The questioning format underscores their disbelief and desire for explanation.|
|JHN 9:11|He answered, 'The man called Jesus made mud and anointed my eyes and told me, “Go to the pool of Siloam and wash.” So I went and washed, and I received my sight.'|This verse captures the moment of miraculous healing by Jesus, emphasizing the act of healing and the instruction given to the blind man. The use of 'mud' (πηλὸν) and 'wash' (νίψαι) highlights the physicality of the miracle, as well as the obedience required from the man. It is significant to maintain the sequence of actions that lead to the restoration of sight, a central theme in the Gospel of John.|
|JHN 9:12|They asked him, 'Where is the man who healed you?' He replied, 'I do not know.'|The original Greek phrase ‘οὐκ οἶδα’ translates directly as 'I do not know'. This phrase expresses uncertainty or lack of knowledge regarding the identity or location of a person. In this context, it shows the blind man's confusion about the whereabouts of Jesus after he received sight. It is important to retain the simplicity and honesty of his response in the translation.|
|JHN 9:13|They brought him who had been blind to the Pharisees.|In this verse, the action of bringing the healed man to the Pharisees underscores the tension between Jesus' miraculous acts and the religious authorities of the time. The word for 'brought' (ἄγουσιν) implies a sense of leading or guiding, which can carry connotations of authority and control, as the Pharisees are the recognized religious leaders. The reference to 'the once blind man' (τὸν ποτε τυφλόν) emphasizes the miraculous change in his condition, which contrasts sharply with the spiritual blindness of the Pharisees.|
|JHN 9:14|Now it was the Sabbath when Jesus made the clay and opened his eyes.|In this translation, the focus is on the miraculous act of healing and its timing on the Sabbath, which is significant in the context of Jewish law and customs. The term for 'made clay' captures the action of Jesus creating something new, while 'opened his eyes' emphasizes the restoration of sight. This miracle is pivotal in understanding Jesus' ministry and the challenges He faced from religious authorities.|
|JHN 9:15|So the Pharisees again asked him how he had received his sight. He replied, 'He put mud on my eyes, and I washed, and now I see.'|This verse depicts the inquiry by the Pharisees regarding the healing of the blind man. It emphasizes the method used by Jesus (applying clay) and the miraculous nature of the healing. The language used is straightforward to reflect the man's clear account of the event, emphasizing his transformation from blindness to sight.|
|JHN 9:16|Therefore, some of the Pharisees said, "This man is not from God, for he does not keep the Sabbath." But others said, "How can a man who is a sinner do such miraculous signs?" And there was division among them.|This verse reflects the ongoing debate among the Pharisees about Jesus' authority and the implications of healing on the Sabbath. The terms 'sinner' and 'signs' are pivotal in understanding the conflict between Jesus and the Pharisaical interpretations of the law.|
|JHN 9:17|They said to the blind man again, "What do you say about him, since he opened your eyes?" He replied, "He is a prophet."|The phrase 'What do you say about him' implies a question of authority and identity, which is central to the themes of revelation and acknowledgment of Jesus' divine role. The term 'prophet' indicates a recognized status in the Jewish tradition, aligning with the questioners' context and the man's understanding of Jesus' significance.|
|JHN 9:18|Therefore, the Jews did not believe concerning him that he had been blind and had received his sight, until they called the parents of the one who had received his sight.|This verse emphasizes the skepticism of the Jews regarding the miraculous healing of the blind man. Their unwillingness to believe even in the face of a significant miracle reflects a broader theme of disbelief encountered by Jesus during his ministry.|
|JHN 9:19|And they asked them, saying, "Is this your son, whom you say was born blind? How then does he now see?"|This translation aims to retain the inquiry made by the questioners regarding the identity of the man born blind, emphasizing the shock and disbelief expressed by the parents regarding their son's miraculous healing. The use of terms like 'son' and 'born blind' is crucial for clarity in the context of this miraculous event.|
|JHN 9:20|His parents answered them, saying, 'We know that this is our son, and that he was born blind;'|This verse highlights the affirmation by the parents regarding their son’s identity and his condition from birth. It reflects a clear understanding and acknowledgment of the miraculous event, establishing their son's authenticity in the face of questioning by the religious leaders.|
|JHN 9:21|But how he now sees, we do not know; or who opened his eyes, we do not know. He is of age; ask him, he will speak for himself.|The verse reflects the hesitance of the parents to provide further details about the miraculous healing of their son. They acknowledge their son's situation but refuse to speculate about how the miracle occurred or who performed it. The phrase 'he is of age' indicates that he is capable of answering for himself, which they emphasize to avoid potential repercussions from the Jewish authorities.|
|JHN 9:22|His parents said these things because they were afraid of the Jewish leaders; for already the Jewish leaders had agreed that if anyone confessed him as the Christ, he would be put out of the synagogue.|This verse emphasizes the fear that the parents had of the Jewish leaders, which prevented them from openly acknowledging their son's healing and the miracle performed by Jesus. The cultural context of fear of social ostracism due to the prevailing religious authorities is essential to understanding their response.|
|JHN 9:23|Therefore, his parents said, ‘He is of age; ask him.’|The verse reflects the fear and caution of the man's parents, who choose to defer to their son's age and decision-making capability in a moment of social and religious pressure. This translation emphasizes the respect for parental authority and the cultural context of age.|
|JHN 9:24|So they called the man who had been blind a second time and said to him, 'Give glory to God; we know that this man is a sinner.'|The phrase 'give glory to God' is a call to acknowledge God's authority and righteousness. The term 'sinner' indicates a moral judgment often used by the Pharisees in this context. The translation reflects the urgency of the question posed to the man born blind, highlighting their insistence on confronting him about his healer's identity.|
|JHN 9:25|He answered, 'Whether he is a sinner, I do not know; one thing I know: though I was blind, now I see.'|The phrase 'I do not know' is emphasized in this context to signify the man's lack of knowledge regarding the moral character of Jesus, contrasting it with his personal experience of receiving sight. The structure of 'one thing I know' highlights the importance of his newfound sight as the focal point of his testimony.|
|JHN 9:26|They said to him again, 'What did he do to you? How did he open your eyes?'|The question posed here emphasizes the miraculous act of healing that has taken place, specifically focusing on the act of opening the eyes of the blind man. The language reflects a sense of astonishment and inquiry into the nature of the miracle.|
|JHN 9:27|He answered them, 'I told you already, and you did not listen. Why do you want to hear it again? Do you also wish to become his disciples?'|This verse highlights the frustration of the healed man regarding the disbelief of the religious leaders. It emphasizes the idea of persistent refusal to listen to the truth, as well as the call to become a follower of Jesus.|
|JHN 9:28|They reviled him, saying, 'You are his disciple, but we are disciples of Moses.'|In this verse, the confrontation between the formerly blind man and the Pharisees highlights the dichotomy between the disciples of Jesus and the traditional teachers of the Law. The language reflects a strong sense of identity and adherence to religious authority, which the Pharisees claim, contrasting their relationship to Moses with the newly forming community around Jesus.|
|JHN 9:29|We know that God spoke to Moses; but as for this man, we do not know where he comes from.|In this verse, the contrast between the authority of Moses and the unknown origins of Jesus is emphasized. The phrase 'we know' denotes a certainty about the law given through Moses, while 'we do not know' expresses their lack of understanding regarding Jesus' divine authority and origin. The translation seeks to maintain the emphasis on the juxtaposition between established belief and emerging revelation.|
|JHN 9:30|The man answered and said to them, "This is truly remarkable: you do not know where He comes from, and yet He has opened my eyes."|This verse highlights the irony of the situation where the blind man recognizes the miracle done to him, while the religious leaders are ignorant of the source of this miracle. It serves to underline themes of revelation and spiritual blindness.|
|JHN 9:31|We know that God does not listen to sinners, but if anyone is a worshiper of God and does His will, He hears them.|This verse emphasizes the connection between a person's righteousness and God's willingness to listen to their prayers. The term 'sinner' contrasts with 'God-fearing' or 'righteous,' underscoring that a relationship with God is maintained through obedience and reverence.|
|JHN 9:32|Since the world began, it has never been heard that anyone opened the eyes of a man born blind.|The phrase 'from the beginning of the age' signifies a long-standing situation, emphasizing the extraordinary nature of the miracle. The word 'born blind' is key, indicating a complete lack of sight from birth, underscoring the miracle's significance.|
|JHN 9:33|If this man were not from God, he could do nothing.|This verse emphasizes the necessity of divine endorsement for the miraculous works performed. The phrase 'from God' denotes not just proximity but an acknowledgment of divine authority. The expression 'could do nothing' implies a total inability to perform miracles without divine sanction.|
|JHN 9:34|They answered and said to him, 'You were born entirely in sin, and are you teaching us?' And they cast him out.|In this verse, the words 'sinned' and 'teach' indicate a moral and spiritual condemnation from the religious authorities. The phrase 'cast him out' signifies the exclusion and ostracism faced by the one who challenges the prevailing norms. The translation reflects the tone and implications of the original Greek text.|
|JHN 9:35|Jesus heard that they had cast him out, and finding him, said, 'Do you believe in the Son of God?'|In this verse, Jesus approaches the man who had been cast out for his beliefs and asks if he believes in the Son of God. This reflects the theme of faith and recognition of Jesus's divine identity. The phrasing has been carefully chosen to reflect the personal and intimate nature of Jesus's inquiry, highlighting both His concern for the individual and the necessity of faith in Him.|
|JHN 9:36|He answered and said, 'Who is he, Lord, that I may believe in him?'|The phrase 'Who is he, Lord, that I may believe in him?' reflects the seeker’s desire to know and understand Jesus’ identity clearly. This mirrors the nature of faith as something that seeks understanding and relationship, which is consistent throughout the Gospel of John.|
|JHN 9:37|Jesus said to him, 'You have both seen Him, and the one speaking with you is He.'|This verse emphasizes the revelation of Jesus as the Messiah to the man who had been healed. The language reflects the certainty of both sight and identity, indicating a deep spiritual recognition.|
|JHN 9:38|He said, 'Lord, I believe!' And he worshiped Him.|In this verse, the man expresses his faith in Jesus as Lord and shows his reverence by worshiping Him. The original Greek word 'προσεκύνησεν' implies an act of worship that indicates both faith and recognition of Jesus' divine authority. This is significant as it showcases the response of believers when encountering the truth of Christ's identity.|
|JHN 9:39|And Jesus said, 'For judgment I have come into this world, that those who do not see may see, and those who see may become blind.'|This verse highlights the duality of spiritual sight and blindness. Jesus indicates that His coming into the world serves as a judgment, revealing the truth to those who are spiritually blind while allowing those who think they can see to remain in their blindness. The use of 'judgment' here underscores the division caused by His ministry between belief and disbelief.|
|JHN 9:40|Some of the Pharisees who were with Him heard these things and said to Him, 'Are we also blind?'|This verse illustrates the response of the Pharisees to Jesus’ profound statement about spiritual blindness and sight. It captures their self-awareness and defensive inquiry, emphasizing the theme of spiritual perception throughout John's Gospel.|
|JHN 9:41|Jesus said to them, "If you were blind, you would have no sin; but now that you say, 'We see,' your sin remains."|In this verse, Jesus addresses the spiritual blindness of the Pharisees, highlighting that acknowledgment of their sight (understanding) comes with the weight of sin. The construction reflects a condition where their claim to sight brings responsibility for their actions.|
