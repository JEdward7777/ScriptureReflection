|JHN 15:3|You are already clean because of the word I have spoken to you.|The term 'clean' in this context implies a spiritual purification that comes from accepting and adhering to the teachings of Jesus. The phrase 'through the word' emphasizes the power of Christ's message in effecting this state of cleanliness in believers.|
|JHN 15:4|Abide in me, and I in you. Just as the branch cannot bear fruit by itself unless it abides in the vine, neither can you bear fruit unless you abide in me.|The metaphor of the vine and branches illustrates the essential connection between Christ and His followers. 'Abide' suggests a continuous, intimate relationship, while the inability of the branch to bear fruit without the vine emphasizes dependence on Christ for spiritual life and productivity.|

The one who remains in me, and I in them, bears much fruit; for apart from me you can do nothing.|In this verse, the metaphor of the vine and branches illustrates the deep and essential relationship between Christ and His followers.

The notion of 'fulfillment' conveys completeness, suggesting that true joy is found in the fullness of Christ's presence and love.|
|JHN 15:12|This is my commandment, that you love one another just as I have loved you.|In this verse, the emphasis is placed on the command to love one another in the same manner as Christ has loved us.

|JHN 15:13|Greater love has no one than this, that someone lays down his life for his friends.|This translation aims to preserve the original meaning and significance of Jesus' words about love and sacrifice.

The use of 'world' here symbolizes those who are opposed to God's ways, and the reference to hatred reflects the rejection of Christ that His followers may encounter. The verb 'hated' denotes a strong animosity that begins with Jesus Himself, establishing a precedent for the experiences of His disciples.|
|JHN 15:19|If you belonged to the world, it would love you as its own; but because you do not belong to the world, and I have chosen you out of the world, therefore the world hates you.|In this translation, the phrase 'out of the world' is used to reflect the distinction made by Jesus between his followers and the secular world.

|JHN 15:21|But all these things they will do to you because of my name, for they do not know the one who sent me.|This verse highlights the reason for persecution, which stems from the name of Jesus. The phrase 'for my name's sake' signifies the authority and the identity that comes with being associated with Christ, while 'they do not know the one who sent me' indicates a lack of understanding of God the Father among those who oppose Jesus and his followers.|

|JHN 15:24|If I had not done among them the works that no one else did, they would not be guilty of sin; but now they have seen and hated both me and my Father.|In this verse, Jesus points out that if he had not performed such extraordinary works among the people, they would have no grounds for their unbelief. The focus is on the connection between witnessing miraculous deeds and the rejection of his message. The use of 'hatred' here ties back to the previous verse and emphasizes the relational aspect of belief and hostility towards him and the Father.|
|JHN 15:25|But this is to fulfill the word that is written in their Law: ‘They hated Me without a cause.’|This verse highlights the fulfillment of prophetic scripture regarding the unjust hatred towards Christ. It reflects the themes of enmity and rejection found throughout the Biblical narrative, emphasizing that such hatred is not only directed at Jesus but also aligns with the historical enmity expressed in the Hebrew Scriptures.|

The term 'Paraclete' is translated here as 'Helper,' aligning with the supportive role the Holy Spirit plays in the life of believers, guiding and affirming the truth about Jesus.|
|JHN 15:27|And you also will testify, because you have been with Me from the beginning.|This translation aims to reflect the original Greek meaning, emphasizing the communal aspect of witnessing and the relationship the disciples have with Jesus from the very beginning of their journey together.|
