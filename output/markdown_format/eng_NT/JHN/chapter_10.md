| Reference | Verse | Translation Notes |
|:---------:|-------|-------------------|
|JHN 10:1|Truly, truly, I say to you, the one who does not enter the sheepfold by the door but climbs in another way, that person is a thief and a robber.|This verse emphasizes the importance of legitimate access to the community of believers, highlighting the danger of those who attempt to enter without the rightful means, suggesting deception and harm.|
|JHN 10:2|But the one who enters through the door is the shepherd of the sheep.|In this translation, 'the one entering' is rendered to highlight the significance of the action of entering through the door, which emphasizes authority and rightful access. The term 'shepherd' is used to convey the role of a leader and protector of the sheep, aligning with the broader metaphor Jesus uses in this passage.|
|JHN 10:3|To this one, the doorkeeper opens; and the sheep hear his voice, and he calls his own sheep by name and leads them out.|In this verse, the focus is on the relationship between the shepherd and his sheep, emphasizing personal knowledge and care. The term 'thyroros' (θυρωρὸς) refers specifically to the doorkeeper, a figure indicating protection and access. The phrase 'calls his own sheep by name' indicates a personal connection and the importance of individual recognition within the flock.|
|JHN 10:4|And when he has brought out his own sheep, he goes before them, and the sheep follow him because they know his voice.|This verse emphasizes the relationship between the shepherd and the sheep, illustrating the idea of guidance and familiarity through the voice of the shepherd. The Greek term 'ἐκβάλῃ' (ekbalē) implies the action of leading or bringing out, while 'ἀκολουθεῖ' (akolouthei) stresses the notion of following with trust. Therefore, the translation captures the essence of shepherding and the inherent bond of trust between the shepherd and the sheep.|
|JHN 10:5|Yet they will never follow a stranger, but will flee from him, for they do not recognize the voice of strangers.|In this verse, Jesus contrasts the response of his sheep to the voice of a stranger. The term 'ἀλλοτρίῳ' (stranger) emphasizes the notion of unfamiliarity, indicating that true followers will reject the voice of those who do not speak with authority or truth. The verb 'ἀκολουθήσωσιν' (will follow) is used in a negative form, implying a strong refusal to follow, while 'φεύξονται' (will flee) signifies a swift withdrawal from danger. The phrase 'οὐκ οἴδασι' (they do not know) points to a lack of recognition and understanding of false voices.|
|JHN 10:6|Jesus used this figure of speech, but they did not understand what he was telling them.|This verse highlights the challenge of understanding spiritual truths and recognizes the metaphorical language used by Jesus. The word 'παροιμίαν' refers to a proverb or parable, which suggests that the message may not be immediately clear to all listeners, aligning with the themes found in other passages regarding understanding and recognition.|
|JHN 10:7|Therefore, Jesus said again, "Truly, truly, I say to you, I am the door of the sheep."|In this translation, I preserved the imagery of Jesus as the gate, emphasizing His role as the access point for the sheep (His followers) to find safety and sustenance. The repetition of 'Amen' emphasizes the certainty of His statement.|
|JHN 10:8|All who have come before me are thieves and robbers; but my sheep did not listen to them.|The phrase 'all who came before me' implies those false teachers and leaders who did not truly represent God. 'Thieves and robbers' suggests a deliberate intent to deceive and harm. The use of 'sheep' refers to Jesus' followers, emphasizing the protective role He plays as the true shepherd. This translation aims to capture the urgency and clarity of Jesus' warning against falsehoods.|
|JHN 10:9|I am the door; if anyone enters through me, he will be saved, and will go in and out, and find pasture.|In this verse, Jesus identifies Himself as the door, emphasizing His role as the only entry point to salvation and relationship with God. The terms ‘saved’, ‘enter’, and ‘find pasture’ allude to both physical and spiritual sustenance, which is reinforced through the analogy of shepherding common in biblical literature.|
|JHN 10:10|The thief comes only to steal, kill, and destroy. I have come that they may have life and have it abundantly.|This translation emphasizes the contrast between the thief's destructive intent and Christ's purpose of providing abundant life. The original Greek terms for 'thief', 'steal', 'kill', and 'destroy' are maintained for their strong connotations, while 'abundant life' is rendered to capture the richness of the original meaning.|
|JHN 10:11|I am the good shepherd. The good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep.|The term 'good shepherd' conveys the idea of a shepherd who cares deeply for his sheep, contrasting with a mere hired hand who lacks commitment. The phrase 'lays down his life' underscores the self-sacrificial nature of Christ's mission, emphasizing his willingness to suffer for the sake of those he loves.|
|JHN 10:12|But the hired hand, who is not the shepherd, and to whom the sheep do not belong, sees the wolf coming and leaves the sheep and flees; and the wolf snatches them and scatters the flock.|In this verse, the contrast is made between the hired hand (μισθωτὸς) and the true shepherd (ποιμήν). The term for hired hand signifies someone who is not committed to the sheep, indicating a lack of ownership and responsibility, while the true shepherd has an intimate relationship with the sheep. The imagery of the wolf represents a threat that the hired hand flees from, revealing his cowardice and self-preservation, in contrast to the protective nature of the true shepherd.|
|JHN 10:13|The hired hand flees because he is only a hired hand and cares nothing for the sheep.|This translation emphasizes the contrast between the hired hand's lack of concern for the sheep and the true shepherd's commitment to their well-being. It aims to capture the essence of the original Greek text, particularly the sense of abandonment implied by the hired hand's actions.|
|JHN 10:14|I am the good shepherd; I know my own, and my own know me.|In this translation, I aimed to preserve the significance of Jesus identifying Himself as the Good Shepherd, emphasizing the personal relationship He has with His sheep and His recognition of them. The phrase 'Good Shepherd' is translated as 'the shepherd who is good,' reflecting the character and the dedication of Jesus toward His followers.|
|JHN 10:15|Just as the Father knows me, and I know the Father, and I lay down my life for the sheep.|In this verse, the deep relational knowledge between the Father and the Son is emphasized. The use of 'soul' indicates a profound commitment and sacrifice made by Jesus for the sake of the sheep, highlighting the shepherd's role in caring for and protecting his flock.|
|JHN 10:16|And I have other sheep that are not of this fold; I must bring them also, and they will listen to my voice. So there will be one flock, one shepherd.|In this verse, Jesus speaks of other sheep not belonging to the current fold, indicating His mission to reach out beyond the immediate community of Israel. The language emphasizes the inclusive nature of His shepherding role and the unity of His followers under one shepherd.|
|JHN 10:17|For this reason, the Father loves me, because I lay down my life that I may take it up again.|In this verse, the act of laying down one’s life reflects profound sacrificial love and is central to the understanding of Jesus' mission. The term 'soul' (ψυχήν) conveys not just life but the essence of being, underscoring the significance of the sacrifice.|
|JHN 10:18|No one takes it away from me, but I lay it down of my own accord. I have authority to lay it down, and I have authority to take it up again. This command I received from my Father.|This verse emphasizes the authority of Jesus over His own life and death, indicating that His sacrificial act was voluntary and in obedience to the command of His Father. The terms 'laid down' and 'take up' reflect the themes of sacrifice and resurrection present throughout the New Testament.|
|JHN 10:19|Once again there was a division among the Jews because of these words.|This verse highlights the division that arose among the Jews due to Jesus' words. The use of 'schisma' suggests a deep division, perhaps ideological or theological, echoing the ongoing tensions present throughout the Gospel of John as it relates to Jesus' identity and teachings.|
|JHN 10:20|Many among them declared, 'He is possessed by a demon and is raving mad; why do you listen to Him?'|The phrase 'He has a demon and is mad' reflects the sentiment of disbelief and accusation often faced by Jesus during His ministry. This fresh translation aims to capture the original tone while avoiding reliance on existing translations.|
|JHN 10:21|Others said, 'These are not the words of one possessed by a demon. Can a demon open the eyes of the blind?'|In this verse, the argument centers around the capability of Jesus to perform miracles, specifically the opening of blind eyes, which contradicts the claim of demonic possession. The choice of words is aimed to reflect skepticism towards divine power versus demonic activity. The context of previous accusations and disbelief is significant in understanding the statements being made here.|
|JHN 10:22|Then came the Feast of Dedication in Jerusalem, and it was winter.|This verse speaks of the festival of dedication occurring in the winter season, highlighting a moment of significance within the religious life of the Jewish people.|
|JHN 10:23|And Jesus was walking in the temple, in the colonnade of Solomon.|In this translation, the phrase 'in the portico of Solomon' is chosen to reflect the specific location where Jesus was walking, which holds historical significance for the Jewish people. The term 'temple' has been avoided to emphasize the distinct area known for its colonnades, rather than the entire temple complex.|
|JHN 10:24|So the Jews gathered around him and said to him, 'How long will you keep us in suspense? If you are the Christ, tell us plainly.'|In this verse, the Jews surround Jesus and demand clarity about His identity as the Messiah (the Christ). The phrase 'until when will you keep our soul in suspense?' reflects their frustration and urgency in seeking a clear and definitive answer from Him. The term 'Christ' is translated consistently as it denotes the anointed one expected by the Jewish people. The word 'parrhesia' is a Greek term meaning 'boldness' or 'confidence,' which is significant in the context of how they wanted Him to speak plainly about His identity.|
|JHN 10:25|Jesus answered them, 'I told you, and you do not believe. The works that I do in my Father’s name bear witness about me.'|In this verse, Jesus is affirming that His works are a testimony to His divine identity. The phrase 'you do not believe' highlights the refusal of His listeners to accept the truth despite the evidence presented through His actions. This fresh translation seeks to capture the essence of Jesus’ statement while maintaining clarity and faithfulness to the original text.|
|JHN 10:26|But you do not believe, because you do not belong to my sheep, as I said to you.|This verse emphasizes the relationship between faith and belonging to Christ's flock. The use of 'believe' (πιστεύετε) is central, distinguishing those who are part of His community from those who are not. The term 'sheep' (προβάτων) is symbolic of His followers, indicating an intimate connection and knowledge.|
|JHN 10:27|My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me.|In this translation, I aimed to capture the essence of intimacy and recognition between the shepherd and his sheep. The Greek words convey a deep relationship built on trust and understanding, which is fundamental to the message of Jesus as the shepherd.|
|JHN 10:28|And I give them eternal life, and they will never perish, and no one will snatch them out of my hand.|The verse speaks of the eternal life given by Jesus, assuring believers of their security in Him. The phrases used denote permanence and the assurance of salvation, with emphasis on Jesus as the protector against loss or removal from His care.|
|JHN 10:29|My Father, who has given them to me, is greater than all, and no one can snatch them out of my Father's hand.|This verse emphasizes the supremacy of the Father in safeguarding believers, reinforcing the idea that no one can take them away from Him. The words used reflect both the authority of God and the assurance given to believers regarding their eternal security.|
|JHN 10:30|I and the Father are one.|This verse emphasizes the unity between Jesus and the Father, indicating a deep relational oneness rather than a merging of identities. The term 'one' (ἕν) signifies both a spiritual unity and a shared purpose within the Godhead.|
|JHN 10:31|Then the Jews picked up stones again to throw at Him.|This verse depicts the reaction of the Jewish leaders to Jesus' declaration of unity with the Father, emphasizing the gravity of His claims. The word 'stones' is indicative of the violent intent behind their actions, rooted in their interpretation of blasphemy as worthy of death according to the Law.|
|JHN 10:32|Jesus answered them, 'I have performed many good deeds before you from my Father. For which of these deeds are you attempting to stone Me?'|In this verse, Jesus highlights His works as a testimony of His divine authority. The phrase 'many good works' emphasizes the quality and quantity of His actions which reflect God's nature. The term 'stoning' is used here in the context of a serious charge against Him, showcasing the conflict between His identity and the Jewish leaders' understanding.|
|JHN 10:33|The Jews answered Him, saying, 'We are not stoning you for a good work, but for blasphemy, and because you, being a man, make yourself God.'|This verse highlights the accusation of blasphemy against Jesus by the Jews, emphasizing their understanding of His claims about Himself and the consequences of those claims in their cultural and religious context.|
|JHN 10:34|Jesus answered them, 'Is it not written in your law, 'I said, you are gods'?|In this verse, Jesus is responding to accusations of blasphemy by referencing scripture that designates human beings as 'gods' in the sense of having a special relationship with God. The quotation underscores the idea that the use of the term 'god' can refer to those who hold a significant position in God's plan.|
|JHN 10:35|If He called them gods to whom the word of God came, and Scripture cannot be broken,|In this verse, the term 'gods' refers to those who have received the word of God and been given authority, which establishes their standing as representatives of divine authority. The phrase indicates that scripture cannot be annulled or contradicted, emphasizing the permanence and truth of God's word.|
|JHN 10:36|Do you say of him whom the Father consecrated and sent into the world, 'You are blaspheming,' because I said, 'I am the Son of God'?}}|This verse emphasizes the unique relationship between Jesus and the Father, highlighting His divinity and the misunderstanding of His claims by the people. The term 'blasphemy' arises from their failure to recognize His true identity as the Son of God, a central theme throughout the Gospel of John.|
|JHN 10:37|If I am not performing the works of my Father, do not believe me.|This verse emphasizes the importance of the works of God in validating Jesus’ identity and authority. The structure reflects a conditional statement that calls for belief only if the works of the Father are present in Jesus' ministry. It serves as a direct challenge to His accusers, pointing to His actions as evidence of divine endorsement.|
|JHN 10:38|But if I do them, even if you do not believe me, believe the works, so that you may know and understand that the Father is in me, and I am in the Father.|This verse emphasizes the importance of recognizing Jesus' works as a manifestation of His unity with the Father. Even if some do not believe His words, His actions serve as evidence of His divine authority and relationship with God. The phrase 'the works' refers to miracles and teachings that demonstrate God's power and presence.|
|JHN 10:39|So they sought again to seize him, but he escaped out of their grasp.|The phrase 'to seize him' conveys an aggressive intent, reflecting the hostile environment Jesus faced. The term 'out of their hands' indicates deliverance and divine protection. This translation seeks to preserve the original intent while making it clear for contemporary readers.|
|JHN 10:40|And he went away again across the Jordan, to the place where John had been baptizing at first, and there he stayed.|The phrase 'beyond the Jordan' is significant as it indicates a return to a location associated with John the Baptist's ministry. The use of 'the place where John first baptized' reinforces the importance of baptism in this narrative and connects it with the identity of Jesus.|
