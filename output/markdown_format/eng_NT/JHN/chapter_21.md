|:---------:|-------|-------------------|
|JHN 21:1|After these things, Jesus revealed Himself again to the disciples at the Sea of Tiberias; and He revealed Himself in this way.|The phrase 'after these things' indicates a chronological connection to the events previously described in the Gospel. The term 'manifested' implies a revealing of His presence, emphasizing the tangible reality of Jesus' post-resurrection appearances to His disciples. The Sea of Tiberias is also known as the Sea of Galilee, and this location holds significance as a setting for several important events in Jesus' ministry.|
|JHN 21:2|Simon Peter, Thomas (called the Twin), Nathanael from Cana in Galilee, the sons of Zebedee, and two others of His disciples were together.|This verse identifies the disciples who were present, emphasizing their connections and the group dynamic among them. It reflects their relationships and roles, setting the stage for the events that follow in the narrative.|
|JHN 21:3|Simon Peter said to them, "I am going fishing." They said to him, "We will go with you." They went out and immediately got into the boat, and that night they caught nothing.|In this verse, Peter expresses his desire to return to fishing, a significant aspect of his identity prior to following Jesus. The mention of 'that night' indicates a moment of fruitlessness, reflecting a common theme of reliance on Christ for success. The verb choices convey a sense of urgency and collective decision among the disciples.|
|JHN 21:4|But when morning had now come, Jesus stood on the shore; yet the disciples did not know that it was Jesus.|The term 'πρωΐας' signifies 'morning', indicating a time frame after the night of fishing. 'ἔστη' denotes the action of standing, implying a presence or manifestation. The phrase 'οὐ μέντοι ᾔδεισαν' illustrates a lack of recognition, emphasizing the disciples' inability to recognize Jesus, which is crucial in the context of their encounter post-resurrection.|
|JHN 21:5|Then Jesus said to them, "Children, do you have any fish?" They answered Him, "No."|In this verse, the term 'παίδία' (paidia) refers affectionately to 'children' or 'little ones,' indicating a familiar and caring address from Jesus to His disciples. The phrase 'μή τι προσφάγιον ἔχετε;' translates to 'Do you have any fish?' highlighting the disciples' failed fishing attempt from the previous night. This reflects Jesus' concern for their physical needs.|
|JHN 21:6|He said to them, 'Cast your net on the right side of the boat, and you will find some.' So they cast it, and now they were not able to haul it in because of the multitude of fish.|In this verse, the act of casting the net to the right side of the boat symbolizes obedience and faith in Jesus' instructions. The mention of the multitude of fish emphasizes the abundance that comes from following Christ's commands.|
|JHN 21:7|Then that disciple, whom Jesus loved, said to Peter, 'It is the Lord!' As soon as Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord, he wrapped his outer garment around him (for he had taken it off) and jumped into the sea.|This verse illustrates the moment of recognition and immediate action. The disciple whom Jesus loved signifies a close relationship and loyalty. Peter's act of putting on his outer garment before jumping into the sea reflects his eagerness to approach the Lord, even in an unceremonious manner.|
|JHN 21:8|The other disciples came in the boat, for they were not far from land, but about two hundred cubits away, dragging the net full of fish.|In this verse, we observe the close proximity of the disciples to the shore, indicated by their distance being approximately two hundred cubits. The word 'drawing' emphasizes their labor as they bring in the net of fish, symbolizing their ongoing work in the ministry. The term 'others' denotes the collective nature of the disciples' actions, highlighting unity in their purpose.|
|JHN 21:9|When they had stepped onto the land, they saw a charcoal fire set up there, with fish laid upon it and bread.|In this verse, the imagery of a charcoal fire (ἀνθρακιὰν) suggests a setting of warmth and community. The presence of fish and bread symbolizes provision and sustenance, evoking both physical nourishment and the spiritual feeding Jesus provides.|
|JHN 21:10|Jesus said to them, 'Bring some of the fish that you have just caught.'|The original Greek text suggests a direct command from Jesus to His disciples to bring fish, emphasizing the relationship and the sustenance that Jesus provides. The word 'ὀψαρίων' indicates small fish, and 'ἐπιάσατε' indicates the recent catching of these fish, which highlights the miraculous catch they experienced.|
|JHN 21:11|Simon Peter went up and drew the net to land, full of large fish, one hundred fifty-three; and although there were so many, the net was not broken.|The verse emphasizes the abundance of fish caught by Simon Peter, showcasing both the miraculous nature of the event and the preservation of the net despite its heavy load. The translation seeks to capture the nuances of the Greek text, particularly the specific count of fish and the detail that the net did not tear, symbolizing divine provision and power.|
|JHN 21:12|Jesus said to them, "Come and eat breakfast." None of the disciples dared to ask him, "Who are you?" They knew it was the Lord.|In this verse, the phrase 'come and dine' is conveyed through the term 'ἀριστήσατε', which captures the sense of gathering to eat, emphasizing fellowship. The disciples' hesitation to question Jesus reflects their recognition of His authority as the risen Lord, encapsulated in the phrase 'οὐδεὶς δὲ ἐτόλμα' (but no one dared).|
|JHN 21:13|Jesus came and took the bread, and gave it to them; and likewise the fish.|This verse reflects the intimate and personal act of Jesus providing food for His disciples, emphasizing both His physical provision and spiritual presence among them. The term 'bread' is significant in Biblical texts, often symbolizing sustenance and fellowship, while 'fish' can denote abundance and the miraculous provision of God. The translation aims to convey the simplicity and warmth of this moment, reinforcing the relationship between Jesus and His disciples after His resurrection.|
|JHN 21:14|This was now the third time that Jesus revealed himself to his disciples after he had risen from the dead.|The phrase 'Jesus showed himself' emphasizes the act of revelation to his disciples after resurrection. The original text denotes the third appearance of Jesus to his disciples, which signifies its importance in affirming their faith.|
|JHN 21:15|When they had finished eating, Jesus said to Simon Peter, 'Simon son of John, do you love me more than these?' He replied, 'Yes, Lord; you know that I have affection for you.' Jesus said to him, 'Feed my lambs.'|In this verse, Jesus asks Peter if he loves Him more than these (referring to the other disciples or perhaps their fishing livelihood). The interplay between 'love' (ἀγαπᾷς) and 'affection' (φιλῶ) indicates a distinction between different levels of love. The command to 'feed my lambs' implies a pastoral responsibility entrusted to Peter by Jesus.|
|JHN 21:16|He said to him a second time, 'Simon son of John, do you love me?' Peter answered, 'Yes, Lord; you know that I hold deep affection for you.' Jesus said to him, 'Tend my sheep.'|In this verse, Jesus again asks Peter if he loves Him, emphasizing the relational aspect of their bond. The use of 'love' (ἀγαπᾷς) in this context is often interpreted as agape love, a selfless, sacrificial love, contrasting with Peter's affirmation of having 'affection' (φιλῶ) for Jesus. The command to 'shepherd' (ποίμαινε) suggests leadership and care for others, reinforcing the responsibilities Peter would undertake as a disciple.|
|JHN 21:17|He said to him the third time, 'Simon, son of John, do you love me?' Peter was grieved because He asked him the third time, 'Do you love me?' And he said to Him, 'Lord, you know all things; you know that I love you.' Jesus said to him, 'Feed my sheep.'|In this verse, the repetition of the question reflects Peter's deeper emotional struggle and the profound relationship between Jesus and Peter. The term 'love' used here corresponds to a more intimate understanding, distinguishing it from mere friendship. The instruction to 'feed my sheep' symbolizes the pastoral care Jesus expects from Peter, emphasizing leadership within the community of believers.|
|JHN 21:18|Truly, truly, I say to you, when you were younger, you used to dress yourself and walk wherever you wished; but when you grow old, you will stretch out your hands, and another will gird you and carry you where you do not wish to go.|In this verse, the imagery of youth and old age signifies the transitions in life and the eventual surrender to God’s will. The expression of being 'girded' and 'taken' indicates a loss of autonomy and the experience of being directed by others. This reflects a profound spiritual truth about discipleship and the call to follow Christ, even when it leads to discomfort or suffering.|
|JHN 21:19|This he said, signifying by what kind of death he would glorify God. And after saying this, he said to him, "Follow me."|This verse indicates the prophetic indication of Peter's martyrdom and the manner of his glorification in death, reinforcing the theme of discipleship and following Jesus, even unto death.|
|JHN 21:20|Turning around, Peter saw the disciple whom Jesus loved following them, the one who had leaned back against Jesus at the dinner and had said, 'Lord, who is it that is going to betray you?'|In this verse, the phrase 'the disciple whom Jesus loved' refers to John, traditionally understood as the author of this Gospel. The act of reclining at the table is indicative of intimacy and closeness, illustrating the deep relationship between Jesus and His disciples, especially John. This verse emphasizes Peter's awareness of John following him and evokes the themes of discipleship and love within the context of Jesus' post-resurrection appearances.|
|JHN 21:21|When Peter saw him, he said to Jesus, 'Lord, what about this man?'|This verse captures Peter's reaction upon seeing the disciple whom Jesus loved, highlighting Peter's curiosity and concern for others in the context of following Jesus. The term 'Lord' shows Peter's recognition of Jesus' authority, while 'this one' indicates his inquiry about the fate of the other disciple in contrast to his own path.|
|JHN 21:22|Jesus said to him, "If I want him to remain until I come, what is that to you? You follow me!"|In this translation, the essence of Jesus' message to Peter is retained, emphasizing the call to personal discipleship rather than concerning oneself with others' fates. The phrasing is adapted to convey clarity and faithfulness to the original Greek.|
|JHN 21:23|Therefore, this saying spread among the brothers that this disciple would not die; yet Jesus did not say to him that he would not die, but, 'If I desire him to remain until I come, what is that to you?'|This verse addresses the misunderstanding that arose among the early disciples regarding the fate of the beloved disciple. The language used here conveys the importance of personal discipleship and following Jesus individually rather than being preoccupied with the paths of others.|
|JHN 21:24|This is the disciple who testifies about these things and has written them down. We know that his testimony is true.|This verse emphasizes the credibility of the testimony of the beloved disciple. The use of the terms 'witness' and 'testimony' is crucial in establishing the reliability of the accounts written by him, aligning with the theme of truth that runs throughout the Gospel.|
|JHN 21:25|And there are also many other things that Jesus did, which if they were to be written one by one, I suppose that even the world itself could not contain the books that would be written. Amen.|In this verse, the emphasis is on the multitude of Jesus' actions and teachings that remain unrecorded. The Greek term "κόσμος" (kosmos) suggests the universe or the world, hinting at the impossibility of containing the entirety of Christ's deeds in written form. The phrase "οὐδὲ αὐτὸν οἶμαι τὸν κόσμον χωρῆσαι τὰ γραφόμενα βιβλία" literally implies that even the world could not contain the books that would be written about Jesus.|
