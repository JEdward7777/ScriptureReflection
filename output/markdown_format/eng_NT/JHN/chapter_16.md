| Reference | Verse | Translation Notes |
|:---------:|-------|-------------------|
|JHN 16:1|These things I have spoken to you so that you would not be led astray.|In this verse, Jesus is warning His disciples about future trials and persecutions. The term 'scandalized' implies not just offense but a deep spiritual stumbling that can come from encountering hardships in faith. The use of 'talked' or 'spoken' is to signify that these words are meant to prepare the disciples for what is to come, aiming to fortify their faith rather than let them fall into despair.|
|JHN 16:2|They will expel you from the synagogues; indeed, the hour is coming when anyone who kills you will think they are offering service to God.|This verse highlights the severity of the persecution that the followers of Christ would face. The phrase 'those who kill you will think they are offering service to God' reflects a misalignment between genuine faith and actions that are based on misunderstanding or deceit. It emphasizes the conflict that arises when true believers challenge the established religious norms.|
|JHN 16:3|And they will do these things because they have not known the Father nor Me.|The verse conveys the idea that those who persecute believers do so out of ignorance of God and Christ. It highlights a lack of knowledge or recognition of the divine nature of Jesus and His relationship with the Father, which is a theme that resonates throughout the Gospel of John.|
|JHN 16:4|But I have spoken these things to you so that when the hour comes, you may remember them, that I told you. These things I did not say to you from the beginning, because I was with you.|This verse emphasizes the importance of remembering Christ's teachings in the face of trials. The phrase 'when the hour comes' signifies a future time of difficulty, while 'I told you these things' indicates preparation for such moments. The context of the verse also highlights the personal connection between Jesus and His disciples, reinforcing the idea of forewarning for their benefit.|
|JHN 16:5|But now I am going to Him who sent Me, and none of you asks Me, ‘Where are You going?’|In this verse, Jesus speaks of His impending departure to the Father, indicating that His disciples do not grasp the significance of His words. The tone reflects both a sense of urgency and the emotional distance created by His departure, which contrasts with the previous assurance He provides them. This translation emphasizes the direct speech of Jesus and the disciples' confusion, making it clear that they are not questioning Him about His departure due to a lack of concern, but rather from a place of bewilderment.|
|JHN 16:6|But because I have spoken these things to you, your hearts have been filled with grief.|This translation emphasizes the emotional state of the disciples as Jesus prepares them for His departure. The word 'sorrow' is reflected as 'grief' to convey a deeper sense of emotional weight. The phrase 'has filled your hearts' is used to reflect the fullness of their sorrow, suggesting an overwhelming experience.|
|JHN 16:7|But truly, I tell you, it is for your benefit that I go away. For if I do not go away, the Helper will not come to you; but if I depart, I will send Him to you.|In this translation, the emphasis is placed on the necessity of Jesus' departure for the coming of the Helper, often understood as the Holy Spirit. The term 'Helper' is a key theological concept in this passage, as it signifies the continued presence and guidance of God with the believers after Jesus' ascension.|
|JHN 16:8|And when He comes, He will convict the world concerning sin, righteousness, and judgment.|In this verse, the emphasis is on the Holy Spirit's role in revealing truths about sin, righteousness, and judgment to the world. The terms 'convict', 'sin', 'righteousness', and 'judgment' are pivotal in understanding the scope of the Holy Spirit's ministry.|
|JHN 16:9|about sin, because they do not believe in Me.|This translation aims to convey the concept of unbelief leading to sin as presented in the original text. The phrase 'concerning sin' specifically points to the root issue of disbelief in Jesus, emphasizing the seriousness of rejecting faith in Him as the Messiah.|
|JHN 16:10|and concerning righteousness, because I am going to the Father, and you will see Me no more.|The term 'righteousness' in this verse emphasizes the divine standard of moral integrity and ethical behavior, contrasting the self-righteousness of the world. The phrase 'I go to the Father' signifies a return to divine authority, which highlights the distinction between earthly judgment and heavenly righteousness.|
|JHN 16:11|and concerning judgment, because the ruler of this world has been judged.|The term 'the ruler of this world' refers to Satan, indicating his judgment and defeat. The phrase 'has been judged' denotes a past completed action with ongoing effects, emphasizing the finality of this judgment in light of Christ's victory over sin and death.|
|JHN 16:12|I still have many things to say to you, but you cannot bear them now.|In this verse, Jesus emphasizes that there are many things He wants to share with His disciples, but acknowledges their current inability to grasp it. This communicates a profound truth about spiritual understanding, suggesting that the fullness of revelation comes with time and through the work of the Holy Spirit.|
|JHN 16:13|But when that one comes, the Spirit of truth, he will guide you into all truth; for he will not speak from himself, but whatever he hears, that will he speak, and he will declare to you the things that are to come.|This translation emphasizes the role of the Holy Spirit as the guide into all truth, highlighting the divine source of revelation and the absence of self-originated speech. The phrase 'Spirit of truth' is retained to reflect its importance in understanding the nature of the Holy Spirit's function. The use of 'will guide' stresses the active role of the Spirit in directing believers, while 'what is to come' denotes prophetic revelation that is part of the Spirit's ministry.|
|JHN 16:14|He will glorify me, for he will take what is mine and declare it to you.|The phrase 'ἐκεῖνος ἐμὲ δοξάσει' translates directly as 'He will glorify me,' emphasizing the role of the Holy Spirit in making Jesus known and honored. The use of 'ἐκ τοῦ ἐμοῦ λήψεται' reflects the idea that the Spirit receives what belongs to Jesus, showing the intimate connection between the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. This reinforces the understanding of the Trinity and the guidance of the Holy Spirit in revealing truth to believers.|
|JHN 16:15|All that the Father has is mine; therefore I said that He will take from what is mine and declare it to you.|This verse emphasizes the unity and sharing between the Father and the Son, indicating that everything the Father has belongs to the Son, which underscores the divine relationship and authority in the Trinity.|
|JHN 16:16|A little while, and you will no longer see me; and again a little while, and you will see me, because I am going to the Father.|In this verse, the phrase "a little while" (μικρὸν) indicates a brief period before the disciples will experience a profound change in their relationship with Jesus. The structure of the verse emphasizes both the absence and the eventual sighting of Jesus, linking it to His departure and return in a spiritual sense as He goes to the Father. The term "the Father" signifies the divine relationship and authority of God, underpinning the hope for the disciples in their faith journey.|
|JHN 16:17|So some of his disciples said to one another, 'What does he mean by saying to us, “A little while, and you will not see me; and again a little while, and you will see me,” and, “Because I am going to the Father”?'|In this verse, the disciples express confusion regarding Jesus' words about his departure and return. The use of 'a little while' emphasizes the temporary nature of their separation and the certainty of his return. This translation aims to capture the nuance of the original Greek, reflecting the disciples' dialogue and their emotional response to Jesus' impending departure.|
|JHN 16:18|So they were saying, 'What does he mean by saying, “A little while”? We do not understand what he is talking about.'|In this verse, the disciples are expressing confusion about Jesus’ cryptic statement. The use of 'little' here is pivotal as it highlights their lack of understanding of the spiritual truths he is revealing. The phrasing is intentionally retained to reflect their perplexity and the nature of their discourse.|
|JHN 16:19|Jesus knew they wanted to ask him about this, so he said to them, 'Are you discussing with one another what I meant when I said, “In a little while you will not see me, and then again in a little while you will see me”?'|This verse reflects Jesus’ awareness of his disciples' thoughts and questions about his previous statement regarding a short time of absence. The repetition of 'a little while' serves to emphasize the paradox of seeing and not seeing him, which is central to understanding his upcoming crucifixion and resurrection.|
|JHN 16:20|Truly, truly, I say to you, you will weep and mourn, but the world will rejoice; you will be sad, but your sadness will turn into joy.|In this verse, Jesus emphasizes the contrast between the sorrow His followers will experience and the joy that will ultimately come from their pain. The phrase 'your sorrow will turn into joy' indicates a transformative process, where grief gives way to rejoicing, reminiscent of the cyclical nature of suffering and joy present in other Scriptures.|
|JHN 16:21|A woman, when she is in labor, experiences anguish because her time has come; but when she gives birth to the child, she no longer remembers the pain, for joy has come that a human being has been born into the world.|This verse uses the imagery of childbirth to illustrate the transition from sorrow to joy. The Greek word 'λύπην' (pain) and 'χαρὰν' (joy) are pivotal in understanding the emotional journey described, emphasizing the temporary nature of pain in light of lasting joy.|
|JHN 16:22|So now you indeed have sorrow, but I will see you again, and your hearts will rejoice, and your joy no one will take from you.|In this verse, Jesus speaks to His disciples about the transformation of their sorrow into joy. The structure of the sentence emphasizes the emotional shift from grief to happiness, mirroring the metaphor of childbirth used in the preceding verse. The joy referred to here is deep and internal, suggesting that it is a lasting joy that is not susceptible to being taken away.|
|JHN 16:23|And in that day you will not ask Me anything. Truly, truly, I say to you, whatever you ask the Father in My name, He will give it to you.|This verse emphasizes the importance of asking the Father in Jesus' name, which reflects the authority and relationship believers have with God through Christ. The repetition of 'Amen' underscores the certainty of His promise.|
|JHN 16:24|Until now, you have not asked anything in My name. Ask, and you will receive, so that your joy may be complete.|This translation emphasizes the promise of answered prayer when asked in the name of Jesus. The word 'ask' is presented as an action that not only brings a response but also results in joy for the believer. The structure of the verse maintains a balance between the request and the resulting fulfillment, linking it closely to the joy experienced in receiving answers to prayers.|
|JHN 16:25|These things I have spoken to you in figures of speech; but the time is coming when I will no longer speak to you in figures, but will tell you plainly about the Father.|This verse contrasts the use of parables with direct communication. The phrase 'in parables' refers to the indirect, figurative language previously employed by Jesus, while 'with boldness' signifies the forthcoming clarity in His revelation of the Father. The intent is to emphasize a shift from obscured messages to straightforward and intimate disclosures.|
|JHN 16:26|In that day, you will ask in My name; and I do not say that I will ask the Father on your behalf.|In this verse, Jesus is assuring His disciples that they can directly ask for help or intervention in His name, emphasizing a personal connection with the Father. The Greek phrase 'ἐν ἐκείνῃ τῇ ἡμέρᾳ' signifies a specific future time when their relationship with the Father will be more direct. The word 'αἰτήσεσθε' (you will ask) indicates an active role for the believers in their communication with God, while the reference to His name points to authority and access.|
|JHN 16:27|For the Father himself loves you, because you have loved me and have believed that I came forth from God.|This verse highlights the deep affection the Father has for believers, which is a response to their love and belief in Jesus. The translation maintains the essence of familial love, emphasizing both belief and the divine origin of Jesus.|
|JHN 16:28|I came forth from the Father and have come into the world; again, I leave the world and go to the Father.|This verse illustrates the dual mission of Jesus, highlighting His origin from the Father and His return to Him. The use of 'world' signifies the earthly realm from which Jesus departs and the divine realm to which He is heading, encapsulating His purpose of bringing salvation.|
|JHN 16:29|His disciples said, 'Now You are speaking plainly and not using a figure of speech.'|In this verse, the disciples express their understanding of Jesus' clear communication, contrasting it with His previous use of figurative language. The term 'παρρησία' denotes a sense of boldness or openness in speaking. This freshness in translation seeks to capture the disciples' realization and acknowledgment of this shift.|
|JHN 16:30|Now we know that You know all things and do not need anyone to question You. By this, we believe that You came forth from God.|In this verse, the disciples affirm their understanding of Jesus’ knowledge and divine origin. The translation aims to capture the essence of their realization of His authority and connection to God, using contemporary language while maintaining the theological weight of the original text.|
|JHN 16:31|Jesus answered them, "Now you believe."|In this verse, Jesus acknowledges the disciples' belief. The term 'now' suggests a moment of realization or understanding. The word 'believe' (πιστεύετε) is pivotal in the discourse, indicating a transition in the disciples' faith journey after witnessing Jesus's works and teachings.|
|JHN 16:32|Behold, the hour is coming, and indeed has come, when you will be scattered, each to your own place, and you will leave me alone; yet I am not alone, for the Father is with me.|In this verse, the phrase 'each to his own' captures the idea of individuals returning to their separate lives or situations. The emphasis on being left alone is significant, highlighting the isolation that Jesus anticipates. The presence of the Father alongside Jesus is a crucial comfort amidst this anticipated abandonment.|
|JHN 16:33|I have spoken these things to you so that in me you may have peace. In the world you will have tribulation; but take heart, I have overcome the world.|In this translation, I have aimed to preserve the original intent and context of Jesus' words while using contemporary language that reflects a clear understanding of peace and overcoming difficulties. The terms 'peace' and 'overcome' are central themes, emphasizing the assurance Jesus offers amidst worldly challenges.|
