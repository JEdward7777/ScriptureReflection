The choice of words aims to capture the essence of public confession versus private conduct, reflecting the themes present in the Gospel of John.|

|JHN 7:7|The world cannot hate you, but it hates me because I testify about it that its deeds are evil.|This verse highlights the contrasting attitudes of the world towards believers and Jesus.

|JHN 7:10|But when his brothers had gone up to the feast, then he also went up, not openly, but as if in secret.|In this translation, I've focused on the contrast between public and private actions of Jesus. The terms 'openly' and 'secret' highlight the duality of Jesus' approach as He moves toward Jerusalem for the feast.

|JHN 7:13|Yet no one spoke openly about Him because of their fear of the Jews.|The phrase 'οὐδεὶς μέντοι παρρησίᾳ ἐλάλει περὶ αὐτοῦ' translates to 'No one spoke openly about Him'.

|JHN 7:16|Jesus answered them, saying, 'My teaching is not my own, but comes from the One who sent me.'|This verse highlights the divine origin of Jesus' teaching, emphasizing that it is not of human invention but rather from God, who sent Him.

The term 'glory' (δόξαν) is crucial in understanding the motivation behind the speaker's words, as is the distinction between self-serving and God-serving intentions.|
|JHN 7:19|Did not Moses give you the Law? Yet none of you keeps the Law. Why are you seeking to kill me?|In this verse, Jesus challenges the Jewish leaders regarding their understanding and observance of the law given through Moses.

The contrast with Sabbath observance highlights the tension between religious law and the compassionate acts of healing.|
|JHN 7:23|If a man receives circumcision on the Sabbath so that the law of Moses may not be broken, are you angry with me because I made an entire man well on the Sabbath?|In this verse, Jesus emphasizes the inconsistency in the Jewish leaders' interpretation of the Law regarding the Sabbath. He points out that if they permit circumcision on the Sabbath to uphold the law of Moses, how much more should He be allowed to heal a person, thereby demonstrating the heart of God's law. The contrast between ritual and compassion is central to understanding Jesus' ministry.|
|JHN 7:24|Do not judge according to appearance, but judge with righteous judgment.|In this verse, Jesus is teaching about the nature of judgment.

The use of 'to kill' (ἀποκτεῖναι) underscores the seriousness of the opposition he faced.|
|JHN 7:26|But behold, he speaks with boldness, and they do not say anything to him. Could it be that the rulers indeed know that this one is truly the Christ?|This translation aims to convey the sense of public perception and the authority of Jesus' speech. The use of 'boldly' reflects the confidence with which Jesus spoke, and the phrase 'truly know' emphasizes the skepticism surrounding the rulers' understanding of His identity.|
|JHN 7:27|But we know where this man comes from; when the Christ appears, no one will know where he comes from.|In this translation, I aim to capture the nuances of knowledge and identity associated with the Messiah, particularly how people's understanding is clouded by their preconceived notions. The terms 'know' and 'where' are emphasized to convey the tension between human perception and divine revelation.|
|JHN 7:28|Then Jesus cried out in the temple, teaching and saying, "You both know me and know where I am from; and I have not come on my own authority, but He who sent me is true, whom you do not know."|In this verse, Jesus asserts His divine origin and contrasts it with the crowd's lack of understanding regarding His true identity. The phrase 'I have not come of myself' emphasizes His mission as being from God, rather than self-appointed. The word 'cried out' is used to reflect the boldness with which He taught, fitting the context of a public setting.|
|JHN 7:29|But I know Him, for I am from Him, and He has sent me.|In this verse, Jesus asserts His intimate knowledge of the Father and emphasizes that His authority comes directly from Him.

This reflects the ongoing revelation of God’s plan through Christ and the eventual pouring out of the Holy Spirit on the church.|
|JHN 7:40|Many in the crowd, having heard His words, declared, "This man is truly the Prophet."|The term 'the prophet' is significant in this context, as it references a messianic expectation in Jewish tradition, particularly relating to the prophecy found in Deuteronomy 18:15.

|JHN 7:50|Nicodemus, who had come to Him by night, said to them, 'Does our law judge a man before it hears him and knows what he is doing?'|This verse highlights Nicodemus' role as a member of the Sanhedrin who seeks to understand Jesus' teachings despite the risk of facing his peers' judgment.
