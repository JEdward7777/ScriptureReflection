|JHN 19:1|Then Pilate took Jesus and had Him scourged.|In this verse, the term 'ἐμαστίγωσε' specifically refers to the act of scourging or whipping, which was a common punishment that involved the infliction of pain. The verb captures not only the physical suffering endured by Jesus but also signifies the mockery and abuse that He faced. This translation aims to emphasize the gravity of the action while maintaining clarity in the English language.|
|JHN 19:2|And the soldiers, weaving a crown of thorns, placed it upon His head, and arrayed Him in a purple garment.|This verse emphasizes the mockery and humiliation that Jesus faced before His crucifixion. The use of 'crown' signifies both His kingship and the derision of that claim by the soldiers. The purple robe further signifies royal authority, albeit in a context of mockery.|
|JHN 19:3|And they kept saying, 'Hail, King of the Jews!' and they struck Him with their hands.|This verse describes the mockery Jesus endured at the hands of the soldiers. The phrase 'Hail, King of the Jews' is a taunt, showcasing the irony of their proclamation given the suffering He was enduring. The term 'ῥαπίσματα' (rahipismata) refers to the blows or strikes, emphasizing the physical abuse that was part of His humiliation.|
|JHN 19:4|Then Pilate went out again and said to them, 'Behold, I am bringing Him out to you, so that you may know that I find no fault in Him.'|This verse emphasizes Pilate's declaration of Jesus' innocence before the crowd, reinforcing the theme of unjust suffering. The phrase 'I bring Him out to you' shows Pilate's intention to publicly demonstrate Jesus' lack of guilt.|
|JHN 19:5|Then Jesus came out wearing the crown of thorns and the purple robe. And Pilate said to them, 'Behold the Man!'|In this translation, I aimed to capture the imagery and the emotional weight of the moment as Jesus is presented to the crowd. The terms used reflect both the physical reality of what Jesus is wearing—a crown of thorns and a purple robe—and the irony of the mockery of His kingship.|
|JHN 19:6|When the chief priests and officers saw Him, they cried out, saying, 'Crucify Him! Crucify Him!' Pilate said to them, 'You take Him and crucify Him, for I find no fault in Him.'|The phrase 'Behold the Man' is a powerful declaration emphasizing Jesus’ humanity. Pilate’s interaction showcases his recognition of Jesus' innocence amidst the overwhelming pressure from the crowd.|
|JHN 19:7|The Jews answered him, 'We have a law, and according to our law, He ought to die because He made Himself the Son of God.'|The Jewish leaders assert their authority based on their interpretation of the Law. This verse highlights their legal justification for seeking Jesus' death, based on their claim that He has made Himself the Son of God.|
|JHN 19:8|When Pilate heard this statement, he became even more afraid.|The phrase 'ἐφοβήθη' indicates a heightened state of fear or concern that Pilate experiences upon hearing the declaration that Jesus is the Son of God. This psychological response reflects his internal conflict and apprehension about the implications of the trial and the accusations against Jesus. The translation aims to capture both the literal meaning and the emotional weight of the moment.|
|JHN 19:9|And he entered the Praetorium again and said to Jesus, "Where are You from?" But Jesus gave him no answer.|This verse highlights the tension in the conversation between Pilate and Jesus, with Pilate's inquiry about Jesus' origins underscoring his authority and confusion. The lack of response from Jesus can be interpreted as a profound statement of His kingship, as well as His awareness of the futility of Pilate's questioning.|
|JHN 19:10|Pilate said to Him, "Are You not speaking to me? Do You not know that I have the power to crucify You and the power to release You?"|In this verse, Pilate expresses his astonishment at Jesus' silence and emphasizes his authority to crucify or release Him. The translation aims to capture Pilate's authority and Jesus' composure in the face of interrogation. The term for authority (ἐξουσίαν) is significant, as it indicates a granted power that is acknowledged as coming from a higher source.|
|JHN 19:11|Jesus answered, "You would have no authority over Me at all unless it had been given to you from above. Therefore, the one who has delivered Me to you has the greater sin."|In this verse, Jesus speaks directly to Pilate, emphasizing that Pilate's authority is not inherent but rather granted from above. This implies a divine hierarchy in which all authority is ultimately subject to God's will. Jesus also highlights the gravity of the actions of the one who delivers Him, indicating that betrayal carries significant moral weight.|
|JHN 19:12|From then on, Pilate sought to release Him; but the Jews cried out, saying, "If you let this Man go, you are not Caesar's friend. Whoever makes himself a king speaks against Caesar."|This verse illustrates the intense political pressure Pilate faced from the Jewish leaders. Their threats concerning allegiance to Caesar reflect their determination to secure Jesus' condemnation, intertwining their religious authority with the political ramifications of the situation.|
|JHN 19:13|When Pilate heard these words, he brought Jesus out and sat down on the judgment seat at a place called Lithostratos, which in Hebrew is called Gabbatha.|The term 'bema' refers to the judgment seat, a place of authority and decision-making.

|JHN 19:14|Now it was the day of preparation for the Passover, about the sixth hour. He said to the Jews, "Behold, your King!"|This verse indicates the time during the preparation for Passover and refers to the Jewish leadership's acknowledgment of Jesus as their king, although ironically in a context of rejection. The term 'preparation' relates to the rituals preceding Passover, while 'the sixth hour' references a specific time that has symbolic significance in the narrative of Jesus' trial.|
|JHN 19:15|But they shouted, 'Away with Him! Away with Him! Crucify Him!' Pilate said to them, 'Shall I crucify your King?' The chief priests answered, 'We have no king but Caesar.'|In this verse, the words of the Jewish leaders reveal their rejection of Jesus as King, preferring allegiance to Caesar. The intensity of their cry for crucifixion shows their determination and willingness to choose political power over spiritual truth.|
|JHN 19:16|Then Pilate handed Him over to them to be crucified.|The phrase 'delivered him' in this verse corresponds to the Greek word 'παρέδωκεν' (paredōken), which indicates the act of handing someone over for punishment. This emphasizes the authority of Pilate in the judicial process, while also highlighting the fulfillment of prophetic scripture regarding the suffering of Christ. The term 'σταυρωθῇ' (staurōthē) directly translates to 'to be crucified,' which carries the weight of Christ's sacrificial death.|
|JHN 19:17|So they took Jesus, and He went out, bearing His cross to the place called The Skull, which is called in Hebrew, Golgotha.|In this translation, I aim to capture the physical act of Jesus carrying His cross and the significance of the location known as Golgotha, while also reflecting the gravity of the moment of His crucifixion.|
|JHN 19:18|There they crucified Him, and with Him were two others, one on either side, and Jesus in the middle.|This verse highlights the moment of Jesus' crucifixion, emphasizing the placement of Jesus among two others. The Greek term for 'crucified' (ἐσταύρωσαν) is a significant action word here, relating to the intense suffering and the fulfillment of prophecies. The use of 'between' (μέσον) indicates not just a physical position, but also the spiritual significance of being the mediator between two criminals, which aligns with His mission to save the lost.|
|JHN 19:19|Pilate also wrote a title and put it on the cross. It was written: "Jesus of Nazareth, the King of the Jews."|The phrase refers to the title placed above Jesus on the cross, identifying Him explicitly as the Nazarene and the King of the Jews. The wording is carefully selected to maintain the gravity of the accusation while affirming Jesus's identity in a profound theological context.|
|JHN 19:20|Therefore, this title was read by many of the Jews, for the place where Jesus was crucified was near the city; and it was written in Hebrew, Greek, and Latin.|This verse highlights the multilingual nature of the inscription that identified Jesus on the cross. The use of Hebrew, Greek, and Latin signifies the diverse audience present and the significance of Jesus' crucifixion. The translation aims to maintain clarity while reflecting the original intent of the message.|
|JHN 19:21|Therefore the chief priests of the Jews said to Pilate, "Do not write, 'The King of the Jews,' but rather, 'This man said, I am the King of the Jews.'"|The high priests of the Jews are requesting Pilate to change the inscription on the cross that identifies Jesus. They want the wording to reflect their own narrative about Jesus rather than His self-identification. The translation aims to convey their demand clearly while maintaining fidelity to the original Greek text.|
|JHN 19:22|Pilate answered, "What I have written, I have written."|In this verse, Pilate's response reflects his firm decision to leave the inscription as it is. The phrase 'what I have written, I have written' underscores the permanence and authority of his decree, serving as a statement of Pilate’s authority amidst the protests of the chief priests.|
|JHN 19:23|Then the soldiers, when they had crucified Jesus, took His garments and made four parts, to each soldier a part, and also the tunic; now the tunic was seamless, woven in one piece from the top.|In this verse, the action of the soldiers dividing Jesus' clothing reflects the fulfillment of Old Testament prophecy. The seamless garment signifies His purity and uniqueness. The use of 'four parts' aligns with Roman practice regarding spoils. Additionally, the seamless nature of the tunic emphasizes its value and the injustice of its treatment.|
|JHN 19:24|So they said to one another, 'Let us not tear it, but cast lots for it to see whose it will be,' so that the scripture might be fulfilled which says: 'They divided my garments among themselves, and for my clothing, they cast lots.'|This verse refers to the fulfillment of the prophecy found in Psalm 22:18, where the act of dividing garments and casting lots for clothing serves to emphasize the humiliation and suffering of Jesus during His crucifixion. The language highlights the communal decision among the soldiers and reflects a sense of destiny regarding the events of the crucifixion.|
|JHN 19:25|So the soldiers did these things. But standing near the cross of Jesus were his mother, and his mother’s sister, Mary the wife of Clopas, and Mary Magdalene.|This verse captures the scene of the crucifixion and highlights the presence of Jesus' mother and two women named Mary. The use of 'standing near the cross' indicates their steadfastness during His suffering, reflecting the deep emotional bond and loyalty amidst the tragedy.|
|JHN 19:26|When Jesus saw his mother and the disciple whom he loved standing nearby, he said to her, "Woman, behold your son!"|This verse highlights the deep bond between Jesus and His mother, as well as the care He shows towards John, the beloved disciple. The term 'Woman' used by Jesus is respectful and signifies His awareness of the moment's gravity as He entrusts His mother to John's care.|
|JHN 19:27|Then he said to the disciple, 'Behold, your mother!' And from that hour, the disciple took her into his own home.|This translation emphasizes the personal and familial connection Jesus establishes at the cross. The phrase 'into his own' suggests a sense of belonging and responsibility, reflecting the cultural context of care for family members in the Jewish tradition.|
|JHN 19:28|After this, knowing that all things were now accomplished, that the Scripture might be fulfilled, Jesus said, 'I thirst.'|The verse emphasizes Jesus' awareness of the fulfillment of prophecy and his human experience of thirst, illustrating his dual nature as both divine and human. The term 'thirst' is pivotal, symbolizing both physical need and a deeper spiritual thirst, which resonates throughout scripture.|
|JHN 19:29|Now a jar full of sour wine was sitting there; so they put a sponge soaked in the sour wine on a branch of hyssop and held it up to His mouth.|This translation aims to retain the original Greek structure while providing clarity in English. The mention of vinegar is consistent with the prophetic fulfillment from the Psalms, emphasizing the nature of Jesus’ suffering.|
|JHN 19:30|When Jesus had received the sour wine, He said, 'It is finished!' And bowing His head, He gave up His spirit.|The phrase 'It is finished' (τετέλεσται) indicates the completion of Jesus' mission and sacrifice. The use of 'sour wine' (ὄξος) symbolizes a fulfillment of prophecy and a final act of compassion from Jesus even in His suffering. The act of bowing His head signifies the moment of surrender to death, as He relinquishes His spirit.|
|JHN 19:31|Therefore, the Jews, because it was the day of Preparation, so that the bodies would not remain on the cross during the Sabbath (for that Sabbath was a high day), asked Pilate to have their legs broken and that they might be taken away.|In this verse, the urgency of the Jewish leaders to have the bodies removed from the crosses reflects their adherence to the Law regarding the Sabbath. This contextualizes the actions of the religious leaders in relation to the crucifixion, highlighting both their legalistic nature and their role in the events leading to Jesus’ death.|

This action emphasizes the physical suffering endured by those on the cross and also aligns with the prophecy about Jesus' bones not being broken, indicating His fulfillment of Scripture. The term 'soldiers' denotes Roman soldiers, who had authority and were executing the orders given by Pilate, thus highlighting the authority they held at the scene of crucifixion.|
|JHN 19:33|But when they came to Jesus and saw that He was already dead, they did not break His legs.|In this verse, the term 'teqnikōta' (τεθνηκότα) emphasizes that Jesus was already dead, which is crucial for understanding the fulfillment of prophecy regarding His death.

|JHN 19:36|For these things occurred so that the Scripture would be fulfilled: 'Not one of his bones shall be broken.'|The phrase 'not a bone of his shall be broken' emphasizes the fulfillment of prophecy concerning the Messiah. It ties together the theme of sacrificial lambs in the Old Testament, reflecting Jesus as the ultimate Passover Lamb.|
|JHN 19:37|And again another scripture says: 'They will look upon the one whom they have pierced.'|The phrase 'look upon' is rendered here to convey both the act of physical sight and the deeper recognition of significance. The word 'pierced' specifically highlights the nature of the suffering and the fulfillment of prophecy regarding the Messiah.|
|JHN 19:38|After these things, Joseph of Arimathea, who was a disciple of Jesus but secretly for fear of the Jews, asked Pilate that he might take away the body of Jesus; and Pilate gave him permission. So he came and took the body of Jesus.|This verse emphasizes the bravery of Joseph of Arimathea, a secret disciple of Jesus who, despite his fear of the Jewish authorities, boldly approaches Pilate to request the body of Jesus.
