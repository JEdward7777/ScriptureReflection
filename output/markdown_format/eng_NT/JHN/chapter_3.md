| Reference | Verse | Translation Notes |
|:---------:|-------|-------------------|
|JHN 3:1|Now there was a man of the Pharisees, named Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews.|In this translation, 'man' is used to refer to a human being, consistent with the original text. The term 'Pharisees' is maintained as it refers to a specific group of Jewish leaders, and 'Nicodemus' is transliterated to keep the proper name intact. The title 'ruler of the Jews' emphasizes Nicodemus' position in society, providing context to his interactions with Jesus.|
|JHN 3:2|This man came to Jesus by night and said to Him, 'Rabbi, we know that You are a teacher come from God; for no one can perform the signs that You do unless God is with him.'|The term 'Rabbi' is a respectful title for a teacher, indicating Nicodemus' acknowledgment of Jesus' authority. The phrase 'no one can do these signs unless God is with him' emphasizes the divine approval necessary for performing miracles, underscoring the belief that Jesus’ signs validate his divine mission.|
|JHN 3:3|Jesus answered and said to him, "Truly, truly, I say to you, unless one is born again, he cannot see the Kingdom of God."|The phrase 'γεννηθῇ ἄνωθεν' translates to 'born again' or 'born from above', which emphasizes the necessity of a spiritual rebirth to enter the Kingdom of God. This concept resonates throughout the New Testament, indicating a transformative experience that comes from God.|
|JHN 3:4|Nicodemus said to Him, "How can a man be born when he is old? Can he enter a second time into his mother’s womb and be born?"|In this verse, Nicodemus expresses confusion regarding the concept of spiritual rebirth. The original Greek emphasizes the impossibility of physical rebirth for an adult, and this translation captures that tension.|
|JHN 3:5|Jesus answered, "Truly, truly, I say to you, unless one is born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter the kingdom of God."|In this translation, I focused on the terms 'born again' and the necessity of water and Spirit, reflecting the theological significance of regeneration and the dual aspect of being born of both physical and spiritual elements. The phrase 'the kingdom of God' is translated in a way to emphasize its divine authority and nature.|
|JHN 3:6|That which is born of the flesh is flesh, and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit.|In this verse, the distinction between physical birth and spiritual birth is emphasized. The word 'flesh' refers to the human nature, while 'Spirit' refers to the divine, indicating a fundamental difference in origin and nature. The fresh translation seeks to convey this duality clearly.|
|JHN 3:7|Do not marvel that I said to you, 'You must be born from above.'|The term 'born again' in this context emphasizes the necessity of a spiritual rebirth, distinct from physical birth. The use of 'anew' or 'from above' highlights the divine origin of this new birth. It is imperative to convey the urgency in Jesus' message about the necessity of spiritual regeneration.|
|JHN 3:8|The Spirit blows where it wishes, and you hear its sound, but you do not know where it comes from or where it goes. So it is with everyone who is born of the Spirit.|This verse emphasizes the mysterious and sovereign nature of the Holy Spirit's work in the life of the believer. The metaphor of wind illustrates the Spirit's freedom and the lack of human ability to control or fully comprehend His movements. The phrase 'born of the Spirit' encapsulates the concept of spiritual regeneration essential to Christian faith.|
|JHN 3:9|Nicodemus answered and said to Him, "How can these things be?"|This verse reflects Nicodemus' confusion about the spiritual rebirth that Jesus is explaining. The phrase 'how can these things be?' conveys a sense of incredulity and highlights the challenge of understanding spiritual truths with a limited earthly perspective.|
|JHN 3:10|Jesus answered and said to him, "You are the teacher of Israel, and you do not understand these things?"|This verse emphasizes the irony in Nicodemus, a respected teacher of Israel, not understanding the spiritual truths that Jesus is revealing. The use of the term 'teacher' signifies his authority, yet his lack of understanding highlights a spiritual blindness among the religious leaders.|
|JHN 3:11|Truly, truly, I say to you, we speak of what we know and bear witness to what we have seen, yet you do not accept our testimony.|In this verse, Jesus emphasizes the authoritative nature of His teaching and the testimony of what He and His disciples have experienced. The repeated phrase 'Amen, amen' serves to underscore the truth and importance of what He is about to declare. The term 'testify' connects with the themes of witness and understanding, central to the Gospel of John.|
|JHN 3:12|If I have told you earthly things and you do not believe, how can you believe if I tell you heavenly things?|In this verse, Jesus contrasts the earthly with the heavenly, emphasizing the disbelief of those who cannot comprehend spiritual truths despite being taught about them. The use of 'how' underscores the difficulty in grasping heavenly concepts when one struggles with basic earthly truths. 'Believe' and 'heavenly' are significant themes in John's Gospel, often illustrating the transition from physical to spiritual understanding.|
|JHN 3:13|And no one has ascended into heaven except the one who descended from heaven, the Son of Man who is in heaven.|In this verse, Jesus emphasizes His unique authority and origin as the Son of Man who has descended from heaven. The term 'heaven' is used to denote the divine realm, contrasting with earthly understanding. The phrase 'the Son of Man' highlights His dual nature as fully human and fully divine, crucial for comprehending His role in salvation.|
|JHN 3:14|And just as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, so must the Son of Man be lifted up.|This verse draws a parallel between Moses lifting up the serpent in the wilderness and the future event of Jesus being lifted up (crucified). The act of being 'lifted up' indicates both exaltation and suffering, and signifies the means by which salvation would be provided to humanity through Christ.|
|JHN 3:15|that whoever believes in Him may not be lost, but may have everlasting life.|The translation captures the essence of faith in Christ leading to eternal life, paralleling the lifting of the serpent by Moses, which serves as a foreshadowing of Christ’s crucifixion. The use of 'believing' emphasizes the necessity of faith in Him to obtain eternal life, while the contrast of 'perish' versus 'eternal life' is pivotal in understanding salvation through belief.|
|JHN 3:16|For God so loved the world that He gave His one and only Son, that whoever believes in Him shall not perish but have eternal life.|This translation aims to capture the essence of God's profound love for humanity, emphasizing the unique relationship between God and His Son, as well as the universal invitation to believe in Christ for eternal life. The term 'only begotten' is rendered as 'unique Son' to convey the singularity and special nature of Christ's identity while ensuring clarity in contemporary English.|
|JHN 3:17|For God did not send His Son into the world to condemn the world, but to save the world through Him.|In this translation, the emphasis is placed on the purpose of Jesus’ coming, which is to offer salvation rather than condemnation. The use of the word 'save' reflects the intent of God's mission through Christ, aligning with the overall message of love and redemption in the surrounding context of the Gospel of John.|
|JHN 3:18|Whoever believes in Him is not condemned; but whoever does not believe is already condemned, because he has not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God.|In this translation, I sought to convey the essence of faith and judgment in relation to belief in Christ. The contrast between belief and disbelief is emphasized, reflecting the gravity of accepting or rejecting the Son of God.|
|JHN 3:19|And this is the judgment: the light has come into the world, but people preferred darkness over light, because their deeds were evil.|In this verse, the imagery of light and darkness serves to illustrate the moral choice between good and evil. 'Light' represents truth and righteousness, while 'darkness' symbolizes sin and evil actions. The use of 'love' in the context indicates a strong preference for sinfulness over the illuminating presence of God.|
|JHN 3:20|For everyone who practices evil hates the light and does not come to the light, lest his works should be exposed.|This verse highlights the rejection of light by those whose actions are wicked. It reflects the broader theme in John's Gospel of light versus darkness, emphasizing the moral choice individuals make in response to divine revelation.|
|JHN 3:21|But the one who practices the truth comes to the light, so that his works may be clearly seen, that they have been accomplished through God.|This verse emphasizes the idea that those who act in accordance with the truth are drawn to the light, contrasting with those who practice evil. The expression 'works' refers to one's deeds or actions that reflect one's nature or relationship with God. The term 'light' symbolizes truth and revelation, whereas 'darkness' represents sin and ignorance. The phrase 'in God' suggests that the deeds are not merely good but divinely inspired or in alignment with God's will.|
|JHN 3:22|After this, Jesus and His disciples went into the Judean countryside, where He spent time with them and baptized.|The phrase 'with them' emphasizes the companionship and active ministry of Jesus and His disciples, while 'baptizing' connects this passage with the practice of Christian initiation and repentance that is central to the Gospel message.|
|JHN 3:23|John was also baptizing in Aenon near Salim, because there was plenty of water there; and people were coming and being baptized.|This verse highlights John's ministry of baptism occurring in a specific location known for abundant water, indicating the practice's significance and necessity in that context. The term 'baptizing' (βαπτίζων) implies a ceremonial washing, which is central to John's role in preparing the way for Christ.|
|JHN 3:24|For John had not yet been cast into prison.|In this verse, the phrase 'εἰς τὴν φυλακὴν' specifically refers to John the Baptist not yet being imprisoned at the time the events described in John 3 are taking place. The use of 'οὔπω' signifies that it is a present condition, emphasizing John's freedom at this point in the narrative.|
|JHN 3:25|Now a discussion arose among John's disciples with a Jew concerning the matter of purification.|The verse discusses a debate among John's disciples regarding purification practices, specifically referencing the act of washing, which is significant in Jewish tradition. The term 'purification' relates to the Jewish customs surrounding cleanliness and ritual observance, linking to baptism's themes of repentance and spiritual cleansing.|
|JHN 3:26|And they came to John and said to him, 'Rabbi, the one who was with you across the Jordan, whom you have testified about, behold, he is baptizing, and all are coming to him.'|In this verse, the term 'Rabbi' indicates respect and acknowledgment of John’s authority in teaching and baptizing. The phrase 'baptizes and all are coming to him' shows the growing popularity and influence of Jesus as He begins His ministry.|
|JHN 3:27|John answered and said, 'A person cannot receive even one thing unless it is given him from heaven.'|This verse emphasizes the sovereignty of God in granting abilities and gifts to individuals. It reflects the idea that no one can claim success or authority without it being allowed by God. The use of 'heaven' implies divine origin and purpose.|
|JHN 3:28|You yourselves are witnesses that I said, ‘I am not the Christ, but I am the one sent before Him.’|This verse highlights John the Baptist's role as a forerunner to Christ, emphasizing his mission and the humility inherent in his proclamation. The structure of the original Greek indicates John's clear denial of being the Messiah and reinforces his appointed role as one sent by God.|
|JHN 3:29|The one who has the bride is the bridegroom; but the friend who stands and hears him rejoices greatly at the bridegroom’s voice. Therefore, this joy of mine is now complete.|This verse employs the metaphor of a wedding to illustrate the relationship between Jesus (the bridegroom) and His followers (the bride). The joy of the friend of the bridegroom reflects the joy of those who witness and celebrate the union of Christ and His church. The structure of the original Greek is maintained to convey the deep emotion and significance of this relationship.|
|JHN 3:30|He must increase, but I must decrease.|This verse highlights the essential role of Christ in the believer's life, emphasizing the necessity for John to diminish while Jesus increases in prominence. The contrast of growth and reduction is central to the understanding of discipleship and the believer's relationship to Christ.|
|JHN 3:31|He who comes from above is above all; he who is of the earth belongs to the earth and speaks in an earthly way; he who comes from heaven is above all.|This verse highlights the distinction between the earthly and the heavenly, emphasizing the superiority of Christ, who comes from above. The translation aims to capture the theological significance of being 'from above' versus 'from the earth.'|
|JHN 3:32|He bears witness to what he has seen and heard, yet no one receives his testimony.|This verse emphasizes the importance of personal witness and the challenge of acceptance. The word 'testimony' or 'witness' in this context underlines the authority and credibility of what is seen and heard. This fresh translation aims to reflect that nuance while maintaining fidelity to the original Greek.|
|JHN 3:33|The one who has accepted his testimony has certified that God is true.|In this verse, the term 'received' conveys a deep sense of acceptance and belief. The act of sealing (or 'esphragisen') implies a formal endorsement of the truthfulness of God. This captures the profound acknowledgment that those who truly receive the testimony do so with certainty about God's nature as the ultimate truth.|
