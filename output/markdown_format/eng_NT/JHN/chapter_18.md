| Reference | Verse | Translation Notes |
|:---------:|-------|-------------------|
|JHN 18:1|When Jesus had spoken these words, He went forth with His disciples across the Kidron Valley, where there was a garden, into which He and His disciples entered.|In this verse, the reference to Jesus going out with His disciples highlights His close relationship with them as they enter a significant moment in His ministry. The 'brook of Kidron' serves as a geographical marker, setting the scene for the events that will follow. The inclusion of a garden, a place of prayer and reflection, emphasizes the theme of preparation and the sacredness of the moment.|
|JHN 18:2|And Judas, who was betraying Him, knew the place, for Jesus had often met there with His disciples.|This translation focuses on the understanding that Judas knew the specific location where Jesus would be found, due to Jesus's habit of gathering there with His disciples. The word 'betraying' is central, indicating Judas's role in the coming events. The term 'often' emphasizes the familiarity and frequency of Jesus's gatherings at this location, setting the stage for the impending betrayal.|
|JHN 18:3|So Judas, having taken the detachment of soldiers and officers from the chief priests and Pharisees, came there with lanterns, torches, and weapons.|In this verse, the use of 'swords' and 'torches' reflects the ominous and hostile environment surrounding Judas's betrayal. The gathering of armed men signifies the gravity of the situation, emphasizing the treachery of Judas as he approaches Jesus with these implements of violence.|
|JHN 18:4|Jesus, knowing all that was about to happen to him, went forward and said to them, 'Whom do you seek?'|In this verse, Jesus demonstrates His awareness of the situation and the imminent events surrounding His arrest. The Greek term 'ἰησοῦς' refers specifically to Jesus, underscoring His identity. The phrase 'εἰδὼς πάντα τὰ ἐρχόμενα ἐπ᾽ αὐτόν' indicates a profound foreknowledge that is central to Jesus' character and mission. The question 'τίνα ζητεῖτε;' translates directly to 'Whom are you seeking?' highlighting His proactive approach in the encounter with those coming to arrest Him.|
|JHN 18:5|They answered him, 'Jesus of Nazareth.' Jesus said to them, 'I am.' And Judas, who was betraying him, stood with them.|In this verse, the use of 'I am he' indicates the self-identification of Jesus in a manner that echoes the divine name revealed in the Old Testament. The presence of Judas as the betrayer adds a poignant contrast to the declaration of Jesus' identity.|
|JHN 18:6|When Jesus said to them, 'I am he,' they drew back and fell to the ground.|This verse emphasizes the power of Jesus' declaration of 'I am,' which causes those who came to arrest Him to fall back. The phrase reflects a significant claim to divinity, similar to the usage in the Old Testament where God reveals His name to Moses.|
|JHN 18:7|Again he asked them, 'Whom do you seek?' And they replied, 'Jesus of Nazareth.'|The Greek term 'ζητεῖτε' (zēteite) translates to 'seeking' or 'looking for,' which denotes a search for a person or thing. Here, the inquiry emphasizes the intentional pursuit of Jesus by the authorities. The phrase 'Ἰησοῦν τὸν Ναζωραῖον' clearly identifies the person being sought, linking Jesus to his earthly origins.|
|JHN 18:8|Jesus answered, 'I told you that I am He. Therefore, if you seek Me, let these go their way.'|In this verse, Jesus asserts His identity and authority by stating 'I am.' This statement echoes the divine name given in Exodus 3:14, emphasizing His pre-existence and divinity. The directive to let the disciples go illustrates Jesus' protective nature over those who follow Him, reinforcing His role as the Good Shepherd.|
|JHN 18:9|This was to fulfill the word that He had spoken: ‘Of those whom You gave Me, I have lost not one.'|This verse reflects the theme of divine protection and fulfillment of God's promises, particularly concerning the safeguarding of those given to Christ.|
|JHN 18:10|Then Simon Peter, having a sword, drew it and struck the servant of the high priest, cutting off his right ear; the servant's name was Malchus.|This verse describes a violent reaction from Peter during the arrest of Jesus. It highlights both Peter's readiness to defend Jesus and the resulting injury to the high priest's servant. The names and titles used are consistent with the events leading to Jesus' crucifixion, maintaining the narrative's historical and theological accuracy.|
|JHN 18:11|Jesus said to Peter, "Put your sword back into its sheath. Shall I not drink the cup that the Father has given me?"|In this verse, Jesus addresses Peter with a tone of authority, instructing him to put away his weapon. The mention of 'the cup' symbolizes the suffering and sacrifice that Jesus is prepared to endure, which was ordained by the Father. The phrase 'the cup' here resonates with the other references to the cup of suffering in the Gospels, particularly in the context of Jesus' impending crucifixion. This translation captures the immediacy of Jesus' command and highlights the overarching theme of obedience to God's will.|
|JHN 18:12|So the cohort, along with the captain and the officers of the Jews, arrested Jesus and bound him.|The phrase 'Ἡ οὖν σπεῖρα καὶ ὁ χιλίαρχος καὶ οἱ ὑπηρέται τῶν Ἰουδαίων' indicates a formal arrest by a group of soldiers and the chief captain, specifically highlighting the authority behind the action. This translation maintains the tone and gravity of the situation while emphasizing the involvement of the Roman authority and Jewish servants. The structure reflects the urgency and decisiveness of the arrest.|
|JHN 18:13|And they led him first to Annas, for he was the father-in-law of Caiaphas, who was the high priest that year.|In this translation, the key names and roles are preserved to reflect their significance in the narrative. 'Annas' is rendered as 'Annas,' keeping the familiar biblical name, while 'Caiaphas' remains unchanged as he is a central figure in this account. The term 'first' (πρῶτον) indicates that Annas is being identified as the initial authority before the subsequent reference to Caiaphas, the high priest of that year, highlighting the hierarchical structure of Jewish leadership during this period.|
|JHN 18:14|Caiaphas was the one who had advised the Jewish leaders that it was more advantageous for one man to die for the people.|This verse emphasizes the role of Caiaphas in the Jewish leadership and his calculated suggestion that sacrificing one man (Jesus) would be beneficial for the people, reflecting a significant theological concept of substitutionary atonement. The use of the phrase 'it is advantageous for' closely mirrors the intent found in other biblical texts discussing sacrifice and leadership decisions made for the sake of the community.|
|JHN 18:15|Simon Peter followed Jesus, and so did another disciple. This disciple was known to the high priest, and he entered with Jesus into the courtyard of the high priest.|This verse depicts the scene where Simon Peter, despite earlier bravado, is now following Jesus at a distance, demonstrating a moment of vulnerability and the loyalty of another disciple who is known to the high priest, allowing him access. The nuances of following and intimacy are emphasized here, illustrating both the connection and separation experienced by the disciples in this critical moment.|
|JHN 18:16|But Peter stood outside by the entrance. Then the other disciple, who was known to the high priest, went out and spoke to the doorkeeper and brought Peter in.|In this verse, the emphasis is on Peter standing outside the door and the role of the other disciple who is known to the high priest. The narrative reflects the theme of belonging and access within the setting of the high priest's courtyard. The choice of the word 'entrance' instead of 'door' aims to maintain the distinction of being at the threshold without entering immediately, conveying Peter's hesitant position at this critical moment.|
|JHN 18:17|The servant girl who kept the door said to Peter, "You are not also one of this man's disciples, are you?" He said, "I am not."|The doorkeeper’s question highlights the tension and fear that Peter experienced at this moment. The use of 'this man' emphasizes Peter's association with Jesus, while his denial reveals his fear of persecution. This translation aims to maintain the original structure and intent of the Greek text while making it accessible in English.|
|JHN 18:18|Meanwhile, the servants and the officers had made a charcoal fire, because it was cold, and they were warming themselves. Peter was also with them, standing and warming himself.|In this verse, the imagery of the charcoal fire is significant as it creates a setting for Peter's subsequent denial. The word 'servants' emphasizes the lower social status of those present and sets a contrasting scene with Peter's prior position as one of Jesus' disciples. The term 'warming' illustrates the physical comfort they seek in the cold night, which also serves as a metaphor for the warmth of fellowship, now compromised by Peter's denial.|
|JHN 18:19|The high priest then questioned Jesus about his disciples and about his teaching.|In this verse, the high priest's inquiry is directed towards understanding Jesus' disciples and his teaching. The term 'disciples' (μαθητῶν) highlights the close followers of Jesus, while 'teaching' (διδαχῆς) underscores the content and influence of his message. The structure of the question conveys the authority and intention behind the interrogation.|
|JHN 18:20|Jesus answered him, 'I spoke openly to the world. I always taught in synagogues and in the temple, where all the Jews come together; I have said nothing in secret.'|In this translation, emphasis is placed on the openness of Jesus’ teaching and His consistent presence in public spaces, underscoring the contrast with secretive or hidden discourse. The term 'parrhesia' is translated as 'boldly' to convey the confident nature of His speech, and 'synagogues' and 'temple' reflect the communal and religious contexts where teaching occurred.|
|JHN 18:21|Why do you ask me? Ask those who heard me what I said to them; behold, they know what I said.|This translation emphasizes the call to public accountability and the invitation to verify Jesus' teachings with witnesses, reflecting the importance of public testimony in the Christian faith.|
|JHN 18:22|When He had said these things, one of the officers standing by gave a slap to Jesus, saying, "Is that how you answer the high priest?"|In this verse, the focus is on the physical violence directed towards Jesus in the context of a judicial trial. The verb used for 'to strike' (ῥάπισμα) indicates a deliberate action intended to insult or humiliate. The translation captures the confrontation between Jesus and the servant, emphasizing the unjust treatment He received during this moment.|
|JHN 18:23|Jesus answered him, "If I have spoken wrongly, testify concerning the wrong; but if I have spoken rightly, why do you strike me?"|In this verse, Jesus responds to an act of violence against him with a challenge to the nature of the accusation and the legitimacy of the treatment he received. The emphasis on 'evil' and 'good' highlights the contrast between the false accusations and his true nature.|
|JHN 18:24|Annas then sent him bound to Caiaphas the high priest.|The Greek term 'ἀπέστειλεν' is translated as 'sent', indicating the action taken by Annas towards Caiaphas. The word 'δεδεμένον' implies that Jesus was bound or tied, which reflects the treatment he received during his trial. This verse illustrates the chain of custody of Jesus from Annas to Caiaphas, highlighting the authority and role of both figures in the proceedings against him.|
|JHN 18:25|Now Simon Peter stood and warmed himself. They said to him, "Are you not also one of His disciples?" He denied it and said, "I am not."|This verse depicts Peter's attempt to remain inconspicuous while being associated with Jesus during a critical moment. The word 'warming' indicates a physical need for comfort amidst the tension of the moment, and the phrase about being a disciple is a direct challenge to Peter’s identity at this moment of fear and uncertainty.|
|JHN 18:26|But he denied it, saying, "I am not." One of the servants of the high priest, a relative of the one whose ear Peter had cut off, said to him, "Did I not see you in the garden with him?"|This verse depicts Peter's denial and serves as a poignant moment in the narrative, illustrating the tension between loyalty and fear. The use of the word 'denied' is significant, as it highlights Peter's struggle. The phrase 'I am not' reflects a direct repudiation of the identification with Jesus, which can also be seen in other instances of denial throughout the scriptures.|
|JHN 18:27|Again, Peter denied it, and immediately a rooster crowed.|In this verse, Peter's denial of Jesus is marked by the immediacy of the rooster's crow, which serves as a poignant reminder of Jesus' prophecy. The translation captures the essence of betrayal and regret, echoing the emotional gravity of Peter's actions as he responds to the accusation.|
|JHN 18:28|Then they led Jesus from Caiaphas to the governor’s headquarters. It was early morning; and they themselves did not enter the governor’s headquarters, so that they would not be defiled, but could eat the Passover.|This verse describes the early morning actions of the Jewish leaders as they bring Jesus to the Roman governor's residence (the praetorium) while avoiding ceremonial uncleanness in order to partake in the Passover meal. The emphasis is on their desire to maintain ritual purity at a time when they are orchestrating the trial and execution of Jesus.|
|JHN 18:29|So Pilate went out to them and said, 'What accusation do you bring against this man?'|The Greek phrase 'τίνα κατηγορίαν φέρετε' translates to 'what accusation do you bring' emphasizing the judicial inquiry. It reflects Pilate's confusion about the charges against Jesus, suggesting a formal legal procedure.|
|JHN 18:30|They answered him, 'If this man were not a wrongdoer, we would not have delivered him over to you.'|In this verse, the term 'κακοποιός' (translated here as 'wrongdoer') is used to indicate a person who commits evil or wrongdoing. This aligns with the accusations being made against Jesus, emphasizing the perspective of the accusers rather than the truth of the situation.|
|JHN 18:31|Then Pilate said to them, 'Take him yourselves and judge him by your own law.' The Jews replied to him, 'It is not lawful for us to put anyone to death.'|This verse reflects Pilate's attempt to delegate the authority of judgment back to the Jewish leaders. The terms used highlight the legal context and the conflict between Roman law and Jewish law, emphasizing Pilate's role as a Roman governor and the limits of his jurisdiction.|
|JHN 18:32|This was to fulfill the word that Jesus had spoken, signifying by what kind of death he was going to die.|In this verse, the emphasis is on the fulfillment of Jesus' prophecy regarding the manner of his death, which highlights the divine foreknowledge and the specific purpose of his sacrificial death. The phrase ‘the word of Jesus’ reflects the preordained plan that Jesus himself had indicated earlier about his impending crucifixion. The choice of vocabulary aims to capture the somber yet significant tone of Jesus’ mission.|
|JHN 18:33|Pilate then entered the praetorium again, called for Jesus, and said to Him, 'Are You the King of the Jews?'|In this translation, I aimed to convey Pilate's direct inquiry about Jesus' identity as the King of the Jews, maintaining the formal context of the exchange. The phrase 'So you are' is a common way to affirm a statement or inquiry, which captures the essence of Pilate's questioning attitude.|
|JHN 18:34|Jesus answered him, 'Are you saying this on your own, or have others told you about Me?'|In this verse, Jesus responds to Pilate's question by probing the origin of Pilate's inquiry. The structure reflects a dialogue where Jesus seeks to understand if Pilate's question is based on personal conviction or influenced by others, illustrating a deeper philosophical inquiry into truth and authority.|
|JHN 18:35|Pilate replied, 'Am I a Jew? Your own nation and the chief priests have delivered You to me. What have You done?'|This verse reflects the dialogue between Pilate and Jesus, highlighting Pilate's bewilderment about the Jewish leaders' actions against Jesus. It encapsulates the tension of the situation and Pilate's identity as a Roman authority questioning a Jew.|
|JHN 18:36|Jesus answered, 'My kingdom is not of this world; if My kingdom were of this world, My servants would fight, so that I should not be delivered to the Jews. But now My kingdom is not from here.'|In this verse, Jesus emphasizes the otherworldly nature of His kingdom, contrasting it with worldly kingdoms. The language suggests a divine origin and authority that is not derived from human governance or rebellion.|
|JHN 18:37|Therefore Pilate said to Him, 'So you are a king?' Jesus answered, 'You say that I am a king. For this purpose I was born, and for this purpose I have come into the world, to bear witness to the truth. Everyone who is of the truth hears My voice.'|This verse highlights Jesus' purpose of bearing witness to the truth, establishing His identity as a king in a spiritual sense, which contrasts with worldly kingdoms. The emphasis on truth resonates with several other passages in the Gospel of John, where the nature of truth is a central theme.|
|JHN 18:38|Pilate said to Him, 'What is truth?' And having said this, he went out again to the Jews and told them, 'I find no fault in Him.'|In this verse, Pilate asks Jesus a profound question about the nature of truth. The phrase 'What is truth?' captures the skepticism of Pilate amidst the serious inquiry of Jesus' identity. The translation strives to maintain the original intent while providing clarity and resonance with contemporary readers.|
|JHN 18:39|But it is your custom that I release one prisoner to you at Passover. Therefore, do you want me to release to you the King of the Jews?|This verse reflects the practice of releasing a prisoner during the Passover festival, highlighting the tension between the crowd's choice and the injustice of Jesus' impending crucifixion. The term 'King of the Jews' is used to emphasize the identity of Jesus and the ironic situation in which the Jewish leaders find themselves, rejecting their true king.|
|JHN 18:40|So they all shouted again, saying, "Not this man, but Barabbas!" Now Barabbas was a robber.|The phrase used for 'they cried out' is a strong expression, indicating a collective and intense vocal protest from the crowd. The term 'murderer' associated with Barabbas is crucial for the understanding of the crowd's choice and their rejection of Jesus, which sets the stage for the passion narrative.|
