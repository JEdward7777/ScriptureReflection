| Reference | Verse | Translation Notes |
|:---------:|-------|-------------------|
|JHN 20:1|On the first day of the week, Mary Magdalene came early, while it was still dark, to the tomb, and she saw that the stone had been taken away from the tomb.|In this translation, I have focused on the critical elements of time ('the first of the week'), the identity of Mary Magdalene, and the action of approaching the tomb. The phrase 'still dark' emphasizes the early hour, while the mention of the stone being removed highlights the miracle of resurrection. The phrase 'came to the tomb' is a direct action that indicates purpose and urgency.|
|JHN 20:2|So she ran and went to Simon Peter and to the other disciple, the one whom Jesus loved, and said to them, ‘They have taken the Lord out of the tomb, and we do not know where they have laid Him.’|This translation seeks to capture the urgency and emotional context of Mary Magdalene's actions as she discovers the empty tomb. The phrases used aim to emphasize her immediate reaction and her relationship with the disciples.|
|JHN 20:3|Then Peter went out, along with the other disciple, and they headed towards the tomb.|In this verse, the act of leaving is emphasized, reflecting Peter and the other disciple's immediate response to the news brought by Mary Magdalene. The term 'tomb' is consistent with the overall theme of resurrection and discovery that characterizes this chapter.|
|JHN 20:4|The two disciples ran together, but the other disciple outran Peter and reached the tomb first.|In this verse, the action of running is highlighted, emphasizing the urgency and speed of the other disciple compared to Peter. The terms used in the translation are chosen to capture the immediacy of the moment as they race to the tomb, reflecting the excitement and tension of the resurrection narrative.|
|JHN 20:5|And he bent down to look in and saw the linen cloths lying there, yet he did not go in.|In this verse, the action of looking into the tomb and observing the linen cloths provides insight into the initial response of the disciple to the empty tomb. The phrase 'οὐ μέντοι εἰσῆλθεν' indicates a hesitation to enter, emphasizing a moment of contemplation or fear before fully entering the tomb.|
|JHN 20:6|Then Simon Peter came, following him, and went into the tomb; he saw the linen cloths lying there.|This verse describes Peter entering the tomb and observing the linen cloths, emphasizing his actions and the scene he encounters. The choice of words highlights both the action of entering and the careful observation of the burial wrappings.|
|JHN 20:7|and the napkin that had been on His head was not lying with the linen cloths, but was folded up in a separate place.|The original Greek uses the term 'σουδάριον' to refer specifically to a cloth or headpiece, which indicates a significant detail in the context of the burial of Jesus. The phrase 'χωρὶς ἐντετυλιγμένον' suggests that the cloth was set apart, implying a purposeful arrangement rather than just carelessly tossed aside. This translation aims to convey both the physical arrangement and the significance of the cloth in relation to the resurrection narrative.|
|JHN 20:8|Then the other disciple, who had come first to the tomb, entered as well; and he saw and believed.|This verse reflects the moment of realization and belief in the resurrection of Christ by the disciple. The structure emphasizes the action of entering and seeing, which leads to faith. In this context, the word 'believed' (ἐπίστευσεν) highlights a significant moment of faith in the narrative.|
|JHN 20:9|For they had not yet understood the Scripture that he must rise from the dead.|In this verse, the disciples' understanding of Scripture is emphasized, particularly concerning the resurrection of Jesus. The phrase 'that he must rise from the dead' encapsulates a crucial theological point that they had yet to fully comprehend. The choice of words seeks to convey their lack of understanding at that moment.|
|JHN 20:10|So the disciples went back to their own places.|This verse indicates that the disciples returned to their previous state of understanding or feelings after the events of the resurrection were unfolding. The choice of words aims to capture their emotional transition and lack of comprehension in that moment.|
|JHN 20:11|But Mary stood outside the tomb, weeping.|This verse conveys deep sorrow, depicting Mary standing weeping outside the tomb. The verb 'κλαίουσα' indicates an ongoing state of crying, emphasizing her distress and the emotional weight of the moment. The setting outside the tomb suggests a transition from despair to the impending revelation of resurrection.|
|JHN 20:12|And as she wept, she stooped down to look into the tomb, and she saw two angels in white sitting, one at the head and the other at the feet, where the body of Jesus had been laid.|In this verse, the focus is on the sighting of two angels in white garments at the tomb where Jesus was laid. The imagery of angels dressed in white signifies purity and divine presence. The arrangement of one angel at the head and one at the feet correlates with traditional Jewish burial customs and is reminiscent of the mercy seat described in the Ark of the Covenant, emphasizing the holiness of the location.|
|JHN 20:13|And they said to her, "Woman, why are you weeping?" She said to them, "Because they have taken away my Lord, and I do not know where they have laid Him."|In this verse, the focus is on the emotional state of Mary, conveying her grief and confusion at the disappearance of Jesus' body. The translation aims to capture her poignant sorrow while maintaining fidelity to the original Greek structure.|
|JHN 20:14|Having said this, she turned around and saw Jesus standing there, but she did not recognize that it was Jesus.|In this verse, the key elements are the act of turning around, the sight of Jesus standing, and the lack of recognition of His identity. The phrase 'he stood' emphasizes the presence of Jesus after His resurrection, signifying hope and revelation. The term 'know' is used to express an intimate recognition, which is pivotal in understanding who Jesus is after His resurrection.|
|JHN 20:15|Jesus said to her, 'Woman, why are you weeping? Whom are you seeking?' She, thinking Him to be the gardener, said to Him, 'Sir, if you have carried Him away, tell me where you have laid Him, and I will take Him away.'|In this verse, the interaction between Jesus and Mary is pivotal as it highlights the themes of recognition and searching. The term 'gynai' translates as 'woman,' a respectful address. The emotional state of Mary, as reflected in her crying, and her misunderstanding of Jesus' identity serve as a central point in this encounter. This fresh translation seeks to maintain the original nuance while clarifying the dialogue's meaning.|
|JHN 20:16|Jesus said to her, 'Mary.' Turning around, she said to Him, 'Rabboni!' (which means Teacher).|In this verse, Jesus addresses Mary by her name, which is a significant moment of recognition and intimacy. The term 'Rabboni' is an expression of deep respect, translating to 'my teacher' in this context. This reflects Mary's understanding of Jesus as both her teacher and Lord.|
|JHN 20:17|Jesus said to her, 'Do not hold on to me, for I have not yet ascended to my Father. But go to my brothers and tell them, ‘I am ascending to my Father and your Father, to my God and your God.’|In this translation, I've chosen to use the phrase 'do not hold on to me' to convey the idea of Mary Magdalene's grasp on Jesus. The phrase 'I have not yet ascended to my Father' reflects the transition in Jesus' relationship with His followers following His resurrection. The reference to 'my Father and your Father' emphasizes the familial bond between believers and God. This translation maintains clarity and theological integrity while using accessible language.|
|JHN 20:18|Mary Magdalene came announcing to the disciples, ‘I have seen the Lord!’ And she told them the things he had said to her.|The translation aims to capture the sense of urgency and joy in Mary's proclamation of the Resurrection. The use of 'announcing' is intended to reflect the original Greek word ἀπαγγέλλουσα, which conveys the idea of sharing significant news.|
|JHN 20:19|On the evening of that day, the first day of the week, when the doors were locked where the disciples were gathered for fear of the Jews, Jesus came and stood among them and said to them, ‘Peace be with you.’|This translation aims to capture the profound sense of peace that Jesus conveys in the context of fear experienced by the disciples. The structure emphasizes both the setting of fear and the calming presence of Jesus in the midst of it.|
|JHN 20:20|And having said this, He showed them His hands and His side. The disciples rejoiced at seeing the Lord.|This translation aims to capture the original Greek meaning, emphasizing the act of Jesus showing His wounds to the disciples as a means of revealing His identity and assuring them of His resurrection. The word 'hands' and 'side' are particularly significant in establishing the physical reality of His resurrection body, which is a central theme in the New Testament accounts of Jesus post-resurrection appearances.|
|JHN 20:21|Then Jesus said to them again, "Peace be with you. Just as the Father has sent Me, I am sending you."|This translation aims to maintain the essence of the original Greek while providing clarity in modern English. The greeting of 'Peace be with you' reflects the common Jewish blessing, emphasizing Jesus' intent to comfort and commission the disciples.|
|JHN 20:22|And when He had said this, He breathed on them and said, 'Receive the Holy Spirit.'|In this verse, Jesus breathes on His disciples to impart the Holy Spirit, which signifies both empowerment and the fulfillment of His promise. The action of breathing is a symbolic representation of life and divine authority, reminiscent of the creation narrative where God breathed life into man. The phrase 'Receive the Holy Spirit' indicates a transformative act that initiates their ministry.|
|JHN 20:23|If you forgive anyone's sins, they are forgiven; if you retain anyone's sins, they are retained.|This verse conveys the authority given by Christ to His followers concerning the forgiveness of sins and the binding or retaining of them. The verbs used ('forgive' and 'retain') indicate actions that hold significant spiritual consequences. It highlights the responsibility of the apostles in their role as leaders in the early church, empowered by the Holy Spirit.|
|JHN 20:24|Now Thomas, one of the twelve, called the Twin, was not with them when Jesus came.|This verse introduces Thomas, one of the twelve disciples, highlighting his absence during Jesus' initial appearance to the group. The term 'Didymus' means 'twin' and emphasizes Thomas's unique identity among the disciples. The translation seeks to maintain the clarity and context of Thomas’s role within the group dynamics.|
|JHN 20:25|So the other disciples told him, "We have seen the Lord!" But he said to them, "Unless I see the marks of the nails in his hands and put my finger into the nail marks and put my hand into his side, I will not believe."|This verse depicts Thomas's skepticism about the resurrection, highlighting his desire for physical proof. The use of 'touch' and 'see' emphasizes a need for personal experience before belief, common in human nature, especially in profound matters like faith and resurrection.|
|JHN 20:26|Eight days later, His disciples were again gathered inside, and Thomas was with them. Jesus came, though the doors were locked, and stood in the midst, and said, 'Peace be with you.'|In this verse, the phrase 'the doors being shut' conveys the disciples' fear and isolation, while the sudden appearance of Jesus signifies His resurrection power. The greeting 'Peace to you' reflects Jesus’ comforting presence and reassurance in times of doubt.|
|JHN 20:27|Then He said to Thomas, 'Put your finger here and see My hands; and put your hand here and place it in My side. Do not be faithless, but believe.'|In this verse, Jesus invites Thomas to examine His wounds, a profound gesture that addresses Thomas's doubts and illustrates the importance of faith. The words used emphasize a personal interaction and invite a deep understanding of Jesus' resurrection and divine nature.|
|JHN 20:28|Thomas responded to Him, "My Lord and my God!"|This translation emphasizes Thomas's recognition of both the divinity and lordship of Jesus Christ, expressing a profound declaration of faith. The use of 'Lord' and 'God' captures the significance of Thomas's statement, aligning with other scriptural affirmations of Jesus's identity.|
|JHN 20:29|Jesus said to him, "Because you have seen Me, you have believed. Blessed are those who have not seen and yet have believed."|In this verse, Jesus acknowledges Thomas's faith based on sight while pronouncing a blessing on those who believe without seeing. This reflects a central theme of faith in Christianity, where belief is placed in the unseen truths of God.|
|JHN 20:30|Therefore, Jesus also performed many other signs in the presence of His disciples, which are not written in this book.|This verse highlights the multitude of signs and wonders performed by Jesus that were not recorded in this book, emphasizing the significance of what has been documented while alluding to the vastness of Jesus's ministry. The translation seeks to maintain fidelity to the original Greek text while conveying clarity and depth in English.|
|JHN 20:31|But these things are written so that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that by believing, you may have life in His name.|This verse emphasizes the purpose of the Gospel of John, underscoring belief in Jesus as the Christ, the Son of God, and the gift of eternal life through faith in His name. The verb 'believe' (πιστεύω) is central, highlighting its necessity for spiritual life.|
