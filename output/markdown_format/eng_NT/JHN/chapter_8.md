|JHN 8:3|Then the scribes and Pharisees brought a woman caught in adultery, and they set her in the midst of the crowd.|In this verse, the actions of the scribes and Pharisees reveal their intent to trap Jesus rather than seek justice. The term for 'woman caught in adultery' highlights their accusation, while 'standing her in the midst' underscores the public nature of the confrontation.|
|JHN 8:4|They said to Him, 'Teacher, this woman has been caught in the act of adultery.'|This translation captures the formal and accusatory nature of the original text while maintaining clarity and readability in English. The phrase 'caught in the act' reflects the immediacy and seriousness of the situation.|
|JHN 8:5|Now in the Law, Moses commanded us to stone such women. What do You say?|This verse references the Mosaic Law, which prescribed the punishment of stoning for adultery. The phrase 'this kind of woman' implies a reference to the sin of adultery, and the intention is to challenge Jesus' authority in the interpretation of the Law.|
|JHN 8:6|But Jesus stooped down and wrote on the ground with His finger, as they continued to question Him. He raised His head and asked, "What do you say about this?".|In this verse, Jesus is confronted with a question meant to trap Him. The words convey both the tension of the moment and the intention of those asking. The act of writing on the ground is significant, illustrating Jesus’ calm demeanor amidst pressure. The phrase 'what do you say?' is a direct inquiry aimed at challenging His authority and wisdom.|
|JHN 8:7|When they continued to press Him, He stood up and said to them, "Let the one among you who is without sin be the first to throw a stone at her."|In this translation, the essence of Jesus’ words is preserved, emphasizing the importance of self-examination before judging others. The term 'anamārtētos' conveys the idea of being without sin, highlighting the profound moral authority Jesus attributes to the one without sin. The phrase 'let him cast the first stone' has been adapted to resonate clearly with contemporary readers while remaining faithful to the original message.|
|JHN 8:8|And again He bent down and wrote on the ground.|In this verse, the action of writing on the ground can be understood as a symbolic gesture of ignoring or addressing the situation in a non-confrontational way.

|JHN 8:10|Jesus stood up and said to her, 'Woman, where are they?

The question 'Where are your accusers?' highlights the absence of condemnation, resonating with the themes of mercy and forgiveness that characterize Christ's ministry.|
|JHN 8:11|She replied, 'No one, Lord.' And Jesus said, 'Neither do I condemn you; go, and from now on, sin no more.'|In this passage, Jesus emphasizes both His authority to forgive sins and His call to righteous living. The term 'sin' used here is significant as it reflects the individual's need for repentance and transformation. The word 'condemn' indicates a judgment that is not in Jesus's character as He came to save rather than to judge.|
|JHN 8:12|Again, Jesus spoke to them, saying, 'I am the light of the world. Whoever follows Me will never walk in darkness, but will have the light of life.'|This translation emphasizes the metaphor of Jesus as the guiding light that dispels darkness, highlighting the contrast between following Him and remaining in spiritual ignorance or sin.|
|JHN 8:13|Then the Pharisees said to Him, 'You bear witness about Yourself; Your testimony is not valid.'|This verse reflects the skepticism of the Pharisees towards Jesus' self-witness. Their claim that His testimony is not true introduces the broader theme of authenticity in witness, particularly Jesus' divine authority as opposed to human judgment.|
|JHN 8:14|Jesus answered and said to them, "Even if I testify about myself, my testimony is indeed valid, for I know where I came from and where I am going; but you do not know where I come from or where I am going."|In this translation, I maintained the essence of Jesus' defense of His testimony. The key phrases "I know" and "you do not know" emphasize the contrast between His divine knowledge and the ignorance of His listeners. The use of 'valid' rather than 'true' in relation to His testimony reinforces the importance of understanding authority in bearing witness.|
|JHN 8:15|You judge according to human standards; I do not judge anyone.|This verse highlights the difference between the way the religious leaders were judging based on superficial understanding, versus Jesus' perspective which transcends human judgment.|
|JHN 8:16|But if I do judge, my judgment is true, for I am not alone in it, but I and the Father who sent me.|This verse emphasizes the truth of Christ's judgment in contrast to human judgment. It highlights His unique position and the authority of the Father who sent Him, underlining the communal aspect of their relationship and mission.|
|JHN 8:17|In your Law it is written that the testimony of two men is valid.|This verse emphasizes the necessity of multiple witnesses for establishing truth in legal and spiritual matters, reflecting the Jewish legal tradition.|
|JHN 8:18|I am the one who bears witness of myself, and the Father who sent me bears witness concerning me.|In this verse, Jesus emphasizes that he is testifying about himself, but importantly, he includes the testimony of the Father who sent him. The structure is straightforward, but capturing the authority and the divine mission behind his words is critical in translation.|
|JHN 8:19|They said to Him, 'Where is your Father?' Jesus answered, 'You neither know Me nor My Father. If you had known Me, you would have known My Father also.'|In this verse, Jesus emphasizes the connection between Himself and the Father. The use of 'know' indicates a deeper understanding and relationship, not merely recognition. This ties in with other verses that speak to the unique relationship between the Father and the Son.|
|JHN 8:20|These words Jesus spoke in the treasury, teaching in the temple; and no one seized Him, for His hour had not yet come.|In this verse, the phrase 'in the treasury' can be interpreted as 'in the court of the temple where offerings were made,' suggesting a location of teaching among the people. The context emphasizes the teaching of Jesus and the prevailing authority of His message, which stands out even in a place associated with religious observance.|
|JHN 8:21|So again Jesus said to them, 'I am going away, and you will search for me, but you will die in your sin. Where I am going, you cannot come.'|In this verse, Jesus emphasizes the consequences of sin and the inability of the people to follow Him because of their spiritual state. The phrases 'I am going' and 'you cannot come' convey a sense of separation due to sin, a theme echoed throughout the New Testament.|
|JHN 8:22|So the Jews said, 'Is He going to kill Himself because He says, |In this verse, the Jewish leaders express confusion and suspicion regarding Jesus' statement about going away, questioning whether He intends to take His own life due to His claim about going where they cannot follow. This reflects their misunderstanding and concern about His identity and mission.|
|JHN 8:23|And He said to them, 'You are from below; I am from above. You are of this world; I am not of this world.'|This verse highlights the contrast between the origin of Jesus and that of His listeners. The phrase 'you are from below' indicates a worldly perspective, while 'I am from above' indicates a divine and heavenly origin. The repetition of the phrase 'not of this world' serves to emphasize the distinction between earthly and heavenly realms.|
|JHN 8:24|Therefore, I said to you that you will die in your sins; for unless you believe that I am He, you will die in your sins.|This verse emphasizes the necessity of belief in Christ for salvation, contrasting spiritual death caused by sin with the life that comes through faith in Jesus. The phrase 'I am' is a reference to the divine identity of Jesus, echoing God's self-revelation in the Old Testament.|
|JHN 8:25|So they said to Him, 'Who are You?' And Jesus said to them, 'The beginning, just as I have been telling you from the start.'|In this verse, Jesus identifies Himself in relation to the questions posed by the Jewish leaders. The phrase 'the beginning' signifies not only the origin of His teachings but also alludes to His eternal existence. The use of 'I' emphasizes His authority and divine identity.|
|JHN 8:26|I have much to say about you and to judge; but he who sent me is true, and I declare to the world what I have heard from him.|In this verse, Jesus emphasizes His role as a messenger, highlighting the authority and truth of the One who sent Him. The contrast between His own words and the words of the Father is crucial in understanding His mission and the divine truth He conveys.|
|JHN 8:27|They did not understand that he was speaking to them about the Father.|The verse conveys the idea that the listeners failed to comprehend the true identity of Jesus and his relationship with the Father. The emphasis is on their lack of understanding and awareness of the divine connection between Jesus and God the Father.|
|JHN 8:28|So Jesus said to them, "When you have lifted up the Son of Man, then you will know that I am He, and that I do nothing on my own, but speak just as the Father taught me."|In this verse, Jesus indicates a future event where His crucifixion will reveal His true identity as the Messiah and the Son of God. The term 'lifted up' not only refers to the act of crucifixion but also carries a sense of exaltation and revelation. The phrase 'I do nothing of my own' emphasizes His dependence on the Father for authority and instruction, highlighting the unity between the Father and the Son.|
|JHN 8:29|And He who sent me is with me; the Father has not left me alone, for I always do the things that are pleasing to Him.|In this verse, the focus is on the relationship between Jesus and the Father, highlighting the unity of purpose and the assurance that the Father is always present and supportive of Jesus' mission. The phrase 'never left me alone' emphasizes the constant companionship and guidance of the Father in Jesus' ministry. The verb 'do' conveys action and intention, aligning with the theme of obedience to the will of God.|

|JHN 8:32|And you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free.|In this verse, the emphasis is placed on knowing the truth and the liberating power that truth has in the life of a believer. The term 'know' is derived from a deep, experiential knowledge, which leads to the understanding of God's revelation. This truth, as indicated in related verses, is central to the Christian faith, exemplified through Jesus Christ as the embodiment of truth.|
|JHN 8:33|They answered Him, "We are descendants of Abraham and have never been enslaved to anyone. How can You say, ‘You will become free’?"|In this verse, the speakers assert their lineage from Abraham, emphasizing their status and freedom. The words 'freedom' and 'servitude' are crucial themes in this dialogue, especially in light of Jesus' prior statement about the liberating nature of truth. This translation aims to maintain the rhetorical intensity and the implications of heritage and personal bondage in the context of faith.|
|JHN 8:34|Jesus answered them, "Truly, truly, I say to you, everyone who commits sin is a slave to sin."|In this verse, Jesus emphasizes the concept of slavery to sin, which implies a state of bondage that affects one's spiritual freedom.

|JHN 8:35|The slave does not remain in the house forever; the son remains forever.|In this verse, Jesus contrasts the status of a servant (or slave) with that of a son in the household. The original Greek text emphasizes permanence in the position of the son, which suggests the deep relationship and belonging that comes with being a child of God as opposed to a mere servant. The translation aims to capture this contrast clearly while maintaining the gravity of Jesus' statement about spiritual lineage.|
|JHN 8:36|So if the Son sets you free, you will truly be free.|In this verse, the emphasis is on the transformative power of the Son, Jesus Christ, in granting true freedom to those who believe in Him. The term 'freedom' is a key theological concept that underscores liberation from sin and bondage. The structure of the phrase is designed to affirm the assurance of true freedom as a result of the Son's work.|

Jesus said to them, "If you were truly children of Abraham, you would do the works of Abraham."|This verse reflects the ongoing dialogue between Jesus and the Jews who claim descent from Abraham. Jesus emphasizes that true lineage is shown through actions consistent with Abraham's faith and obedience, rather than mere biological descent.|
|JHN 8:40|But now you seek to kill me, a man who has told you the truth that I heard from God; this Abraham did not do.|This verse is a part of the ongoing dialogue where Jesus is addressing the religious leaders' intentions to harm him despite his message of truth. The choice of words highlights the contrast between their actions and the example set by Abraham. The term 'truth' is crucial, as it connects to the themes of divine revelation and the response of faithfulness expected from those who claim to follow God.|
|JHN 8:41|You are doing the works of your father.” They said to him, “We were not born of sexual immorality; we have one Father—even God.”|This verse reflects the accusation and defense presented by Jesus against the claims of His opponents. The phrase 'the works of your father' implies a contrast between divine parentage and earthly heritage, while the statement about not being born of fornication hints at a challenge to the legitimacy of Jesus' identity as the Messiah. The translation maintains the theological implications of divine sonship and the identity crisis that the audience is facing in their rejection of Jesus.|

The terms 'word' and 'voice' highlight the relationship between God’s communication and the ability to perceive it, emphasizing a spiritual barrier. The phrase 'you cannot hear' is indicative of a deeper issue related to spiritual blindness or deafness.|
|JHN 8:44|You are of your father the devil, and you desire to do the will of your father. He was a murderer from the beginning and has never stood for the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaks, he speaks out of his own nature, for he is a liar and the father of lies.|In this verse, Jesus is directly addressing those who oppose him, emphasizing their spiritual lineage to the devil and their alignment with his desires. The term 'father' is used metaphorically to indicate a source of influence, in stark contrast to God, who is seen as the ultimate source of truth and goodness. The contrast between truth and falsehood is a key theme.|
|JHN 8:45|But because I tell you the truth, you do not believe me.|In this verse, Jesus asserts the reliability of His words as truth and highlights the disbelief of His audience. The word 'truth' is emphasized, aligning with the theme of revelation and acceptance of divine knowledge throughout the Gospel of John.|

The phrase 'ὁ ὢν ἐκ τοῦ Θεοῦ' indicates a connection to God that enables one to understand and hear God's words. The latter part of the verse emphasizes that the listeners are not from God, which explains their inability to comprehend the truth. This translation aims to capture the essence of Jesus' teaching about spiritual discernment and the relationship between believers and God.|
|JHN 8:48|The Jews answered him, 'Aren’t we right in saying that you are a Samaritan and have a demon?'|In this verse, the Jews accuse Jesus of being a Samaritan and having a demon. The accusation reflects the animosity between Jews and Samaritans, as well as the spiritual opposition they felt towards Jesus’ message. This fresh translation seeks to capture the contempt and insult implied in the original text.|
|JHN 8:49|Jesus answered, "I do not have a demon, but I honor my Father, and you dishonor me."|In this verse, Jesus responds to accusations with a strong affirmation of his respect for the Father. The term 'demon' indicates the extreme view of his critics, while his declaration of honoring the Father underscores his divine mission. This fresh translation aims to maintain the original meaning while clarifying the contrast between Jesus' character and the accusations against him.|
|JHN 8:50|But I do not seek my own glory; there is One who seeks it and judges.|In this verse, Jesus asserts that He is not seeking personal glory, indicating His humble disposition and commitment to divine authority. The phrase 'the one who seeks and judges' implies the existence of a divine judge who is responsible for true glory, contrasting human judgment with God's perfect judgment.|
|JHN 8:51|Truly, truly, I say to you, if anyone keeps my word, he will never see death.|The phrase 'θάνατον οὐ μὴ θεωρήσῃ' indicates a strong negation of experiencing death, suggesting a promise of eternal life for those who adhere to Jesus' teachings. The repetition of 'ἀμὴν' emphasizes the certainty of the statement, akin to a solemn affirmation.|
|JHN 8:52|So the Jews said to Him, 'Now we know that you are possessed by a demon. Abraham died, and the prophets as well, yet you say, if anyone keeps your word, he shall never taste death for all eternity.'|This verse captures the Jews' response to Jesus' claim about eternal life through obedience to His words. The term 'demon' reflects their disbelief and attempts to undermine His authority. The juxtaposition of Abraham and the prophets with Jesus underscores the tension between traditional Jewish faith and the new teachings of Christ.|
|JHN 8:53|Are you greater than our father Abraham, who died? And the prophets died as well. Who do you make yourself out to be?|In this verse, the Jewish leaders challenge Jesus' claims about His superiority over Abraham, emphasizing Abraham's mortality and questioning Jesus' identity. The translation preserves the rhetorical nature of the question while clarifying the implied comparison between Jesus and Abraham.|
|JHN 8:54|Jesus answered, "If I glorify myself, my glory is nothing; it is my Father who glorifies me, of whom you say, ‘He is our God.’"|In this verse, Jesus emphasizes that true glory comes not from self-assertion, but from God the Father. The term 'glorify' (δόξα) is pivotal, as it contrasts the concept of human honor with divine endorsement. The context suggests a deeper relational dynamic between Jesus and God the Father, wherein God’s glorifying of Jesus substantiates his divine identity.|
|JHN 8:55|But you have not known Him; I know Him. If I were to say that I do not know Him, I would be a liar like you, but I do know Him and keep His word.|In this verse, Jesus contrasts the ignorance of His audience with His own knowledge of God the Father. The use of the term 'know' (γινώσκω) emphasizes a relational understanding rather than mere factual knowledge. Additionally, the assertion that denying knowledge of God would make Jesus a liar speaks to the truthfulness and authority of His claims as the Son of God.|
|JHN 8:56|Your father Abraham rejoiced at the thought of seeing My day; he saw it and was glad.|In this verse, Jesus highlights the joy and anticipation Abraham had for witnessing His day, which is a profound revelation of the connection between the Old Testament patriarch and the New Testament revelation. The term 'rejoiced' is translated from 'ἠγαλλιάσατο', suggesting a deep sense of joy rather than mere happiness. The phrase 'his day' refers specifically to the coming of Christ, which indicates that Abraham had a prophetic insight into the future fulfillment of God's plan of salvation.|
|JHN 8:57|So the Jews said to Him, 'You are not yet fifty years old, and have You seen Abraham?'|The phrase 'fifty years' is highlighted to emphasize the disbelief of the Jews regarding Jesus' claim of having seen Abraham. The original Greek presents a direct challenge to Jesus' assertion of His pre-existence and relationship to Abraham, illustrating the contrast between their understanding and His divine nature.|
|JHN 8:58|Jesus said to them, 'Truly, truly, I say to you, before Abraham was born, I AM.'|In this verse, Jesus makes a profound declaration of His eternal existence, echoing the divine name 'I AM' from the Old Testament. This term establishes His identity as pre-existing Abraham, asserting His divinity.|
|JHN 8:59|So they picked up stones to throw at Him, but Jesus evaded them and went out of the temple, passing through their midst.|In this translation, the action of Jesus hiding and leaving the temple is emphasized. The use of 'evaded' captures the sense of His departure, while 'through their midst' highlights the miraculous nature of His escape.|
