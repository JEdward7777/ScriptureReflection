|:---------:|-------|-------------------|
|JHN 2:1|On the third day, there was a wedding in Cana of Galilee, and the mother of Jesus was there.|The translation reflects the setting of a wedding, a significant cultural and communal event. 'The third day' indicates the chronological progression of events in the narrative, and the phrase 'wedding took place' captures the essence of the joyous occasion. The term 'mother of Jesus' is straightforward and respects the relationship, aligning with common usage in other biblical texts.|
|JHN 2:2|And Jesus and His disciples were also invited to the wedding.|The phrase "ἐκλήθη δὲ" suggests an invitation or calling, highlighting the significance of participation in social events like weddings, a common theme in the Bible. The inclusion of 'Ἰησοῦς' emphasizes Jesus' central role, and 'οἱ μαθηταὶ αὐτοῦ' indicates the close relationship with His disciples.|
|JHN 2:3|When the wine ran out, the mother of Jesus said to Him, 'They have no more wine.'|In this verse, the mention of wine is crucial as it highlights a moment of need and foreshadows the miracle to come. The term 'wine' is used to signify joy and celebration, contrasting the lack of it at the wedding. The wording has been adjusted to maintain the essence of the original Greek text while providing clarity in English.|
|JHN 2:4|Jesus said to her, 'What is that to you and to me, woman? My hour has not yet come.'|In this translation, the phrase 'What does this have to do with me?' reflects a cultural expression indicating a lack of direct obligation or responsibility, while 'woman' is a term of respect. The mention of 'my hour' signifies a recurring theme of timing and purpose in Jesus' ministry, which is pivotal to the understanding of His mission.|
|JHN 2:5|His mother said to the servants, 'Whatever he tells you, do it.'|This translation aims to reflect the original Greek's directive nature, emphasizing the mother's authoritative suggestion to the servants about obeying Jesus' instructions. The phrase captures the essence of obedience and action in response to divine command.|
|JHN 2:6|Now there were six stone water jars there for the Jewish rites of purification, each holding twenty or thirty gallons.|This verse describes the stone jars used for Jewish purification rites, emphasizing the cultural and religious practices of the time. The reference to the number of jars (six) and their capacity indicates a significant amount of water, suitable for ritual cleansing.|
|JHN 2:7|Jesus said to them, "Fill the jars with water." And they filled them to the brim.|In this verse, Jesus commands the servants to fill the jars with water, which highlights both the act of obedience and the transformative nature of water in the context of the miracle that follows. The word 'γεμίσατε' (fill) emphasizes the action that the servants must undertake, while 'ὕδατος' (water) represents both a physical substance and a deeper spiritual significance in the narrative.|
|JHN 2:8|And he said to them, 'Draw some out now and take it to the master of the feast.' And they brought it.|This verse captures the action of the servants in obeying Jesus' instructions, reflecting themes of service and the response to divine command. The word 'ἀντλήσατε' (draw) implies not only the physical act of drawing water but also a readiness to serve and bring forth what is needed.|
|JHN 2:9|But when the head waiter tasted the water that had now become wine, and did not know where it had come from (though the servants who had drawn the water knew), he called the bridegroom.|This verse describes the reaction of the head waiter upon tasting the wine that had been miraculously created from water. The head waiter's amazement emphasizes the quality and unexpected nature of the wine. It is crucial to convey the surprise of the head waiter and the knowledge of the servants who drew the water, thus highlighting the miraculous act of Jesus. The terminology used here conveys both a sense of tradition and the awe of the moment.|
|JHN 2:10|And he said to him, "Every man serves the good wine first, and when people have drunk freely, then the inferior. But you have kept the good wine until now."|This translation captures the metaphorical implications of wine in relation to quality and the unexpected blessings of the Kingdom. The emphasis is placed on the contrast between usual customs and the extraordinary situation presented by Jesus's miracle.|
|JHN 2:11|This, the first of His signs, Jesus performed at Cana in Galilee, and thus He manifested His glory; and His disciples believed in Him.|This verse captures the significance of Jesus' first miracle at the wedding in Cana, revealing His glory and leading to the faith of His disciples. The Greek word 'ἀρχὴν' implies the beginning or initiation, indicating that this event marks the commencement of Jesus' miraculous signs. The term 'δόξαν' refers to the manifestation of divine glory, and 'ἐπίστευσαν' denotes a deep, personal belief, not merely intellectual assent.|
|JHN 2:12|After this, He went down to Capernaum with His mother, His brothers, and His disciples; and they stayed there a few days.|The verse captures the sense of movement from one location to another, emphasizing the familial relationships present in the narrative. The term for 'brothers' reflects the close kinship among Jesus' family, which can imply either biological or extended relations in a cultural context.|
|JHN 2:13|The Passover of the Jews was approaching, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.|The phrase 'the Passover of the Jews' is significant as it ties into the Jewish customs and feasts, which are pivotal to understanding Jesus’ actions in Jerusalem. The term 'went up' indicates a physical and spiritual ascent to the holy city, reinforcing the significance of this pilgrimage during a festival that commemorates deliverance.|
|JHN 2:14|And He found in the temple those who were selling oxen, sheep, and doves, and the money changers sitting there.|This verse depicts Jesus' actions upon entering the temple, where He finds merchants and money changers. The choice of words emphasizes the commercial activities happening within a sacred space, reflecting a theme of purity versus corruption. The terms used in the related verses show parallels in context regarding the cleansing of the temple and the presence of commerce in holy places.|
|JHN 2:15|And making a whip of cords, He drove them all out of the temple, both the sheep and the oxen; and He poured out the coins of the money changers and overturned their tables.|In this translation, the action of Jesus is described vividly to reflect both His authority and His zealousness for the sanctity of the temple. The words used convey a sense of urgency and forcefulness, staying true to the original intent of the text.|
|JHN 2:16|And to those who were selling the pigeons He said, 'Take these things away; do not make My Father’s house a house of trade.'|This verse highlights Jesus’ cleansing of the temple, emphasizing the contrast between a place of worship and commercial activities. The original Greek employs strong verbs that convey authority and urgency, which I've attempted to reflect in the fresh translation.|
|JHN 2:17|His disciples remembered that it is written, 'The zeal for Your house will consume me.'|In this verse, the disciples recalled a scriptural prophecy regarding zeal for the temple. The emphasis on 'zeal' (ζῆλος) reflects a passionate commitment to God's house, indicative of the reverence and sacredness that surrounds worship. The translation seeks to convey the sense of urgency and intense emotion implied in the original Greek.|
|JHN 2:18|So the Jews answered Him, 'What sign do You show us for doing these things?'|In this verse, the term 'sign' refers to a miraculous indication or proof of divine authority, reflecting the demand of the Jews for evidence of Jesus' actions in the temple. The use of 'show' here implies a request for demonstration rather than a verbal explanation. The word 'doing' relates closely to Jesus' previous actions in cleansing the temple, highlighting the tension between His authority and the expectations of religious leaders.|
|JHN 2:19|Jesus answered them, "Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up."|This verse reflects Jesus' prophetic statement about His resurrection and foreshadows His own death and triumph over it. The term 'temple' here symbolizes not only the physical structure but also Jesus' own body, which He refers to in the context of His resurrection.|
|JHN 2:20|Then the Jews said, "This temple has been under construction for forty-six years, and will you raise it up in three days?"|This verse is a response from the Jews that highlights their disbelief and confusion regarding Jesus’ statement about the temple. The mention of 'forty-six years' indicates the time taken for the renovation of the temple, underscoring the significance of the physical temple versus the spiritual implications of Jesus' words.|
|JHN 2:21|But He was speaking of the temple of His body.|In this verse, 'the temple of His body' signifies Jesus' physical body as the true temple, contrasting with the physical structure of the Jerusalem temple. The use of 'His body' emphasizes the incarnation of Christ and the new covenant. This insight provides a deeper understanding of Jesus' mission and the nature of worship in spirit and truth.|
|JHN 2:22|Therefore, when He was raised from the dead, His disciples remembered that He had said this, and they believed the Scripture and the word which Jesus had spoken.|In this verse, the act of remembering plays a crucial role in the disciples' understanding of Jesus' resurrection and His teachings. The structure indicates a causal relationship between Jesus' resurrection and their recollection of His words, highlighting the fulfillment of His prophecy and the deepening of their faith in Scripture and His spoken promises.|
|JHN 2:23|Now when He was in Jerusalem at the Passover, during the feast, many believed in His name, observing the signs which He did.|This verse highlights the response of the people to Jesus' miraculous signs during the Passover festival in Jerusalem, illustrating the nature of faith based on observation. The phrase 'many believed in His name' indicates that their faith was connected to His identity and works, not merely to abstract concepts. The signs referred to are acts that manifest divine authority, serving to confirm the truth of His mission.|
|JHN 2:24|But Jesus did not entrust Himself to them, because He knew all people.|In this verse, the emphasis is on Jesus' awareness of human nature and His reluctance to trust their beliefs. This highlights His omniscience and the distinction between mere belief based on signs and genuine faith. The term 'believed' (ἐπίστευεν) suggests a surface-level faith, while Jesus' knowledge (γινώσκειν) indicates a deeper understanding of the true nature of those who believed in Him.|
|JHN 2:25|and He did not need anyone to testify concerning man, for He Himself knew what was in man.|This verse emphasizes the omniscience of Jesus, highlighting that He does not require external validation or testimony about human nature because He possesses an innate understanding of it.|
