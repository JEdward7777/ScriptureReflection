|JHN 11:1|Now a certain man named Lazarus was ill; he was from Bethany, the village of Mary and her sister Martha.|The name Lazarus comes from the Hebrew name Eleazar, which means 'God has helped.' Bethany is a small village near Jerusalem, significant for its connection to Mary, Martha, and Lazarus, who were close to Jesus.|
|JHN 11:2|Mary, who anointed the Lord with perfume and wiped His feet with her hair, was the sister of Lazarus, who was sick.|In this verse, the reference to Mary who anointed the Lord with ointment (myrrh) and wiped His feet with her hair is significant as it highlights her devotion and service. This context of caring actions prepares the reader for the emotional and miraculous events surrounding Lazarus's illness and eventual resurrection. The term 'anointing' signifies a deep respect and reverence.|
|JHN 11:3|So the sisters sent word to Him, saying, 'Lord, behold, he whom You love is sick.'|This verse captures the urgent plea of Mary and Martha regarding their brother Lazarus's illness. The phrase 'whom you love' highlights the deep personal relationship and affection that Jesus has with Lazarus, contrasting the physical ailment he is facing.|
|JHN 11:4|When Jesus heard it, He said, "This sickness is not unto death, but for the glory of God, so that the Son of God may be glorified through it."|This translation captures the essence of Jesus' statement regarding the purpose of Lazarus's sickness, emphasizing that it serves a greater purpose beyond physical death, focusing on the glory of God and the glorification of the Son.|
|JHN 11:5|Now Jesus loved Martha and her sister and Lazarus.|This verse highlights the deep love that Jesus had for Martha, her sister, and Lazarus. The use of the word 'love' is central to understanding the nature of their relationship and the compassion Jesus embodies.|
|JHN 11:6|So when He heard that he was ill, He stayed in the place where He was for two days.|In this verse, the phrase 'ἔμεινεν ἐν ᾧ ἦν τόπῳ' emphasizes the idea of remaining in a specific location, which conveys Jesus' intentional choice to stay where He was, despite hearing about Lazarus's illness. The two-day delay is significant in the context of the narrative, highlighting Jesus’ divine purpose and timing.|
|JHN 11:7|Then after this, He said to His disciples, "Let us go back to Judea."|In this verse, Jesus addresses His disciples directly about returning to Judea. The phrase 'ἄγωμεν' (let us go) is imperative, indicating a command or strong encouragement to move. The context suggests a shift from staying in one place to taking action despite previous reluctance due to the situation in Judea.|
|JHN 11:8|The disciples said to Him, "Rabbi, the Jews were just now seeking to stone You, and are You going there again?"|In this verse, the disciples are expressing concern about Jesus' safety as they prepare to return to Judea, where the Jews have sought to harm Him. The use of the term 'Rabbi' reflects the respect they hold for Him, while their mention of the threats illustrates the tense atmosphere surrounding His ministry.|
|JHN 11:9|Jesus answered, "Are there not twelve hours in the day? If anyone walks during the day, he will not stumble, because he sees the light of this world."|This verse emphasizes the importance of walking in the light of day, both literally and spiritually, as Jesus equates His presence and the knowledge of His mission to the light that guides believers, preventing them from stumbling.|
|JHN 11:10|But if anyone walks at night, he stumbles, because the light is not in him.|In this verse, the imagery of walking at night versus walking in light emphasizes the danger and confusion that comes from living in spiritual darkness. The use of 'light' here reflects the presence of Christ and His teachings, which guide believers in their spiritual journey.|
|JHN 11:11|He said these things, and after that, He told them, 'Our friend Lazarus has fallen asleep, but I go to awaken him.'|The term 'sleep' is used metaphorically here to refer to death, a common biblical theme that illustrates the temporary state of the body until resurrection. The phrase emphasizes Jesus' authority over death and His ability to awaken Lazarus from this state, highlighting His role as the source of life.|
|JHN 11:12|The disciples said to Him, 'Lord, if he has fallen asleep, he will recover.'|The disciples misunderstood Jesus' words about Lazarus's condition, interpreting 'asleep' literally rather than recognizing it as a metaphor for death. The Greek term 'κεκοίμηται' (he has fallen asleep) carries implications of rest and eventual awakening, reflecting the hope of resurrection.|
|JHN 11:13|Jesus had spoken of his death, but they thought that He meant he was taking rest in sleep.|In this verse, the Greek word for 'death' is contrasted with 'sleep,' which indicates a state of temporary rest rather than a permanent end. The misunderstanding by the disciples shows a lack of comprehension of Jesus' teachings about life, death, and resurrection. The term 'sleep' in a biblical context often refers to a state of being before resurrection.|
|JHN 11:14|Then Jesus told them plainly, "Lazarus has died."|In this verse, Jesus explicitly declares Lazarus' death to his disciples. The word 'apethanen' (ἀπέθανε) translates to 'has died', confirming the finality of death rather than mere sleep. This highlights the importance of the situation and sets the stage for the miracle to follow.|
|JHN 11:15|And I rejoice on account of you, so that you may believe, for I was not there; but let us go to him.|In this verse, Jesus expresses a sense of joy despite the death of Lazarus, emphasizing the importance of belief in His words and actions. The use of 'believe' and 'not being there' highlights the significance of faith even in challenging circumstances.|
|JHN 11:16|Then Thomas, who is called the Twin, said to his fellow disciples, 'Let us also go, that we may die with him.'|This translation reflects the commitment and willingness of Thomas and the disciples to follow Jesus even into potential danger, embodying the spirit of self-sacrifice and solidarity. The phrase 'let us go' indicates unity among the disciples, while 'that we may die with him' emphasizes their readiness to share in Christ's fate.|
|JHN 11:17|When Jesus arrived, he found that Lazarus had already been in the tomb for four days.|This translation captures the narrative and emphasizes the timeline of Lazarus' death as noted in the Greek text, using contemporary English for clarity.|
|JHN 11:18|Now Bethany was near Jerusalem, about fifteen stadia away.|The term 'Bethany' refers to a specific location near Jerusalem, while the phrase 'close to Jerusalem' indicates proximity. The measurement 'about fifteen stadia' corresponds to approximately two miles, which emphasizes the nearness of Bethany to Jerusalem. This context is important to establish the geographical setting of the events surrounding Lazarus.|
|JHN 11:19|And many of the Jews had come to Martha and Mary to offer them consolation concerning their brother.|The term 'paraklesis' in the original text suggests a form of comforting or encouragement, which is reflected in the selected related verses. The phrase 'many of the Jews' indicates a community gathering, emphasizing the social aspect of mourning and support during difficult times.|
|JHN 11:20|So when Martha heard that Jesus was coming, she went out to meet Him; but Mary sat still in the house.|In this verse, the emphasis is on Martha's action of going out to meet Jesus, while Mary remains in the house. The translation seeks to maintain the original meaning while conveying the contrast between the two sisters' responses to Jesus' arrival.|
|JHN 11:21|Martha then said to Jesus, "Lord, if You had been here, my brother would not have died."|Martha's expression of regret over Jesus' absence is reflective of her faith in His power. The phrase 'if you had been here' signifies her belief in Jesus' ability to heal and her sorrow over the circumstances of her brother's death. The tone is both sorrowful and hopeful, as Martha still acknowledges Jesus as 'Lord'.|
|JHN 11:22|But even now, I know that whatever you ask of God, God will grant you.|In this verse, Martha expresses her faith in God's ability to respond to requests, highlighting a relationship of confidence between believers and God. The translation captures the essence of her statement while maintaining clarity and faithfulness to the original Greek.|
|JHN 11:23|Jesus said to her, "Your brother will rise again."|In this verse, Jesus assures Martha of the resurrection of her brother Lazarus, highlighting His authority over death. The term 'ἀναστήσεται' is translated as 'will rise', reflecting the hope of resurrection that is central to Christian belief. This assurance can also be interpreted in the light of other scriptures that affirm resurrection and eternal life through faith in Christ.|
|JHN 11:24|Martha said to Him, "I know that he will rise again in the resurrection at the last day."|In this verse, Martha expresses her belief in the resurrection that will happen at the end of times. The translation focuses on maintaining the theological implications of resurrection and the context in which Martha speaks to Jesus about her brother.|
|JHN 11:25|Jesus said to her, 'I am the resurrection and the life.'|This verse captures the essence of Jesus' identity as both the source of resurrection and life itself. The Greek 'ἐγώ εἰμι' directly translates to 'I am', which indicates a profound declaration of existence and authority. The terms 'ἀνάστασις' (resurrection) and 'ζωή' (life) are fundamental to Christian belief, illustrating not just physical resurrection but spiritual life in Him.|
|JHN 11:26|And everyone who believes in me, even if he dies, will live; and everyone who is alive and believes in me shall never die. Do you believe this?|This verse emphasizes the promise of eternal life for those who believe in Jesus, even in the face of physical death. The original Greek contains a double assurance: those who die believing will live, and those who are alive and believe will never experience death eternally. The final question serves to challenge the listener's faith in this promise.|
|JHN 11:27|She said to Him, "Yes, Lord; I have come to believe that You are the Christ, the Son of God, who is coming into the world."|In this verse, Martha expresses her belief in Jesus' identity as the Messiah and the Son of God. The phrase "I have believed" conveys a strong sense of faith and trust. The translation aims to maintain the personal and direct nature of her response to Jesus, as well as the significance of acknowledging Jesus as the Christ, which is central to Christian faith.|
|JHN 11:28|And having said this, she went away and secretly called her sister Mary, saying, "The Teacher is here and is calling for you."|In this verse, the term 'Teacher' (διδάσκαλος) is used to refer to Jesus, emphasizing His role in guiding and teaching. The intimate call to Mary (Μαρίαν) reflects the personal nature of their relationship, as well as the urgency in Jesus' presence. The phrase 'is here' (πάρεστι) conveys a sense of immediacy and presence, suggesting that the Teacher is actively involved in their lives.|
|JHN 11:29|As soon as she heard this, she got up quickly and went to Him.|The phrase 'ἐγείρεται ταχὺ' conveys urgency in the action of rising. It reflects a strong sense of immediacy in the response of Martha. The term 'ἔρχεται' indicates the direction towards Jesus, which is significant in conveying her intent to meet Him quickly.|
|JHN 11:30|But Jesus had not yet come into the village, but was still in the place where Martha met Him.|The verse indicates that Jesus had not yet entered the village but was in the area where Martha had met Him. The translation seeks to maintain the structure and meaning of the original text, focusing on the setting and action described.|
|JHN 11:31|So the Jews who were with her in the house, comforting her, noticed that Mary had quickly risen and gone out. They followed her, saying, "She is going to the tomb to weep there."|This verse illustrates the deep communal support provided by the Jewish mourners and their misunderstanding of Mary's intent, highlighting their concern and empathy in a time of grief.|
|JHN 11:32|When Mary arrived where Jesus was and saw him, she fell at his feet, saying to him, "Lord, if you had been here, my brother would not have died."|In this verse, Mary expresses her grief and faith through a profound act of humility. The use of the word "Lord" (Κύριε) emphasizes her recognition of Jesus' authority and power over life and death, paralleling other passages where individuals display a similar reverence. The phrase 'if you had been here' suggests a longing for Jesus’ presence and reflects her belief in His ability to change her brother's fate. The translation captures both her sorrow and her acknowledgment of Jesus' power.|
|JHN 11:33|When Jesus saw her weeping, and the Jews who had come with her also weeping, he was deeply moved in spirit and troubled himself.|In this verse, the original Greek term 'ἐνεβριμήσατο' indicates a strong emotional response, often translated as 'groaned' or 'snorted with indignation.' The word 'κλαίουσαν' means 'weeping' or 'crying' which captures the emotional weight of the scene. It is important to convey Jesus's compassion and the disturbance he felt in his spirit due to the sorrow surrounding him.|
|JHN 11:34|And He asked, 'Where have you laid him?' They replied, 'Lord, come and see.'|In this verse, the interaction shows Jesus' concern and empathy towards the situation. The original Greek words emphasize His inquiry into the location of Lazarus, highlighting both His emotional state and the relationship He has with those mourning.|
|JHN 11:35|Jesus wept.|In this verse, the Greek term 'ἐδάκρυσεν' translates directly to 'wept,' denoting a deep emotional response from Jesus. This particular instance captures His empathy and sorrow in a moment of grief, reflecting His human emotions in the face of loss.|

|JHN 11:37|But some of them said, 'Could not this man, who opened the eyes of the blind, have also kept this man from dying?'|In this verse, the speaker questions whether Jesus, who performed miraculous healings, could prevent death in Lazarus, reflecting both skepticism and a lack of understanding of Jesus' divine authority. The choice of words emphasizes the miracle of restoring sight to the blind as a significant act of power.|
|JHN 11:38|Then Jesus, once more deeply moved within Himself, approached the tomb. It was a cave, and a stone was lying against it.|In this verse, 'ἐμβριμώμενος' indicates a deep emotional state, perhaps conveying both anger and grief. The word 'μνημεῖον' signifies a tomb or burial place, which is consistent with the traditional view of Jesus' power over death and resurrection. The stone mentioned ('λίθος') indicates a barrier, both physically and metaphorically, which Jesus is about to confront.|
|JHN 11:39|Jesus said, 'Remove the stone.' Martha, the sister of the deceased, said to Him, 'Lord, by this time there will be a stench, for he has been dead four days.'|This translation emphasizes the urgency and concern of Martha regarding her brother Lazarus, while also reflecting the authoritative command of Jesus. The term 'stone' signifies both a physical barrier and a metaphorical barrier of death that Jesus is about to overcome.|
|JHN 11:40|Jesus said to her, 'Did I not tell you that if you believe, you will see the glory of God?'|In this verse, Jesus emphasizes the necessity of faith for experiencing the revelation of God's glory. The wording captures both a rhetorical and an encouraging tone, inviting Martha to believe in His power to reveal God's majesty in the situation at hand. 'Glory' is presented as a tangible aspect of God's nature that can be witnessed through faith.|
|JHN 11:41|So they took away the stone from the place where the dead man was lying. And Jesus lifted His eyes upward and said, 'Father, I thank You that You have heard Me.'|In this verse, the act of rolling away the stone signifies the unveiling of death's barrier and emphasizes faith and gratitude towards God. The phrase ‘I thank You’ reflects the deep relational aspect between Jesus and the Father, indicating confidence in God’s responsiveness to prayer.|
|JHN 11:42|But I knew that You always hear Me; but because of the crowd standing here, I said this, so that they may believe that You sent Me.|In this verse, Jesus acknowledges His continuous communication with the Father and explicitly states the reason for His prayer before the crowd, emphasizing the purpose of His miracle: to foster belief among those present. The phrase 'that You have heard Me' reflects His assurance of being listened to, indicative of His unique relationship with the Father. This translation maintains the original meaning while ensuring clarity in modern English.|
|JHN 11:43|And when He had said these things, He called out in a loud voice, 'Lazarus, come forth!'|The phrase 'Λάζαρε, δεῦρο ἔξω' can be translated to convey a command that expresses authority and urgency. The term 'κραύγασε' indicates a loud and powerful voice, signifying the importance of this moment. In this context, Jesus is not only calling Lazarus out of the tomb but also demonstrating His power over death. 'ἔξω' literally means 'outside,' emphasizing the transition from death to life.|
|JHN 11:44|And the dead man came out, his hands and feet still wrapped in grave clothes, and a cloth was around his face. Jesus said to them, 'Unbind him and let him go.'|In this verse, we emphasize the action of Lazarus emerging from death, still bound but alive. The details regarding how he was bound and how the face was covered are significant in illustrating the miracle and its implications. The command to 'unbind' him is crucial as it indicates a release from the state of death.|
|JHN 11:45|Therefore, many of the Jews who had come to Mary and had seen what Jesus did believed in Him.|This verse highlights the response of many Jews who witnessed Jesus’ miracle and their subsequent belief in Him. It emphasizes the impact of Jesus' works on the faith of the onlookers.|
|JHN 11:46|But some of them went to the Pharisees and told them what Jesus had done.|This verse illustrates the divided response to Jesus' miracles, highlighting the tension between belief in Him and the opposition from religious leaders. The use of 'some' indicates that not everyone reacted positively to the miracle, thus setting the stage for conflict.|
|JHN 11:47|So the chief priests and the Pharisees gathered the Sanhedrin and said, 'What are we to do? This man is performing many signs.'|The original text reflects a gathering of religious authorities concerned about the signs Jesus is performing. This translation aims to capture the gravity of their deliberation regarding Jesus' impact.|
|JHN 11:48|If we let him go on like this, everyone will believe in him, and the Romans will come and take away both our place and our nation.|This verse reflects the fears of the religious leaders concerning the influence of Jesus on the people, emphasizing the concern about loss of power and control over the nation.|
|JHN 11:49|But one of them, Caiaphas, who was high priest that year, said to them, 'You know nothing at all.'|In this verse, Caiaphas is characterized as the high priest, emphasizing his authority and role during this pivotal moment. The phrase 'you do not know anything' reflects a lack of understanding or insight, common in discussions about spiritual and political matters, showing Caiaphas' dismissal of the disciples' concerns.|
|JHN 11:50|You do not realize that it is better for us that one man should die for the people, rather than the whole nation be destroyed.|The verse reflects the idea of sacrifice for the greater good, a common theme in both the Old and New Testament. Caiaphas's statement is a cold, pragmatic view of leadership, weighing the life of one against the fate of many.|
|JHN 11:51|But he did not say this on his own; as high priest that year, he prophesied that Jesus was going to die for the nation.|This verse emphasizes the prophetic role of Caiaphas as the high priest, indicating that his statement regarding Jesus’ death was not of his own will but rather a divine foretelling of the purpose of Christ’s sacrifice for the nation. The language used here reflects both authority and the prophetic tradition found in the Old Testament, linking the leadership of Israel with God's overarching plan.|
|JHN 11:52|And not for the nation only, but also to gather together in one the children of God who are scattered abroad.|This verse speaks of the purpose of Jesus' death, indicating that it is not only for the nation of Israel but also for all of God's scattered children. The use of the phrase 'gather into one' reflects the unifying mission of Christ for all believers, emphasizing inclusivity beyond just the Jewish nation.|
|JHN 11:53|From that day on, they plotted together to put Him to death.|This verse highlights the determination of the leaders to take extreme measures against Jesus after hearing His teachings. The phrase 'convened' indicates a formal decision-making process among the leaders, reflecting their fear and hostility towards Him.|
|JHN 11:54|Therefore, Jesus no longer walked openly among the Jews, but departed from there to a region near the wilderness, to a city called Ephraim, and there He stayed with His disciples.|In this verse, 'παρρησίᾳ' suggests boldness or openness, and its negation ('οὐκέτι') indicates a significant shift in Jesus' behavior due to the threat against his life. The phrase 'διέτριβε μετὰ τῶν μαθητῶν αὐτοῦ' indicates a period of teaching or fellowship among his disciples away from public scrutiny.|
|JHN 11:55|Now the Passover of the Jews was near, and many went up to Jerusalem from the country before the Passover to purify themselves.|This verse highlights the approach of Passover, a significant festival for the Jews, emphasizing the practice of ritual purity before the celebration. The use of 'to Jerusalem' indicates the centrality of the city in Jewish religious life, and 'to sanctify themselves' reflects the preparation required for such an important occasion. The language captures both the cultural context and the specific actions of the people as they prepared for Passover.|
|JHN 11:56|So they were seeking Jesus and were saying to one another in the temple, "What do you think? Will He not come to the feast?"|This verse captures the anticipation and curiosity surrounding Jesus' presence during the Passover festival. The phrase 'what do you think' indicates a deliberation among the people, reflecting their uncertainty about whether Jesus would attend the celebration, which is significant in the context of the tensions that existed between Jesus and the Jewish authorities.|
|JHN 11:57|So the chief priests and the Pharisees had given a command that if anyone knew where He was, he should report it, so that they might seize Him.|This verse reveals the intent of the chief priests and Pharisees to apprehend Jesus, reflecting their growing animosity toward Him and their willingness to resort to informants. The term 'μηνύσῃ' suggests the idea of betrayal or delivering information that could lead to someone's arrest, an important theme in the narrative of Jesus's trial and crucifixion.|
