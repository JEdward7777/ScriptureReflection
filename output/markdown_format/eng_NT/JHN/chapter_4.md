| Reference | Verse | Translation Notes |
|:---------:|-------|-------------------|
|JHN 4:1|Now when Jesus learned that the Pharisees had heard that He was making and baptizing more disciples than John—|This verse introduces a key point in the ministry of Jesus where His popularity begins to attract attention from the Pharisees, particularly in relation to His baptizing ministry. The emphasis on 'more disciples' serves to illustrate the growing influence of Jesus in contrast to John the Baptist.|
|JHN 4:2|Although Jesus Himself was not baptizing, it was His disciples who carried out the baptisms.|This verse clarifies the role of Jesus' disciples in the act of baptism, distinguishing it from Jesus’ direct involvement. This serves to emphasize the disciples’ active ministry while maintaining the primary focus on Jesus' teaching and mission.|
|JHN 4:3|He left Judea and went back once more to Galilee.|In this verse, the phrase "ἀφῆκε τὴν Ἰουδαίαν" indicates a departure from Judea, which is significant in the context of Jesus' ministry and interactions with the religious authorities of the time. The term "ἀπῆλθεν εἰς τὴν Γαλιλαίαν" emphasizes His journey to Galilee, which was often a region less associated with the religious elite. This translation captures both the literal movement of Jesus and the implied significance of His shift in focus to Galilee.|
|JHN 4:4|But he had to pass through Samaria.|In this translation, I have captured the essential meaning of the original Greek text, focusing on the necessity implied in the verb 'Ἔδει' (it was necessary). This reflects Jesus' purposeful journey through Samaria as part of His mission.|
|JHN 4:5|So He came to a town of Samaria called Sychar, near the plot of ground that Jacob gave to his son Joseph.|This verse introduces the city of Sychar in Samaria, connecting it to Jacob's heritage and his well, providing cultural and geographical context for the events that follow in the chapter.|
|JHN 4:6|Now Jacob's well was there. Jesus, therefore, tired from His journey, sat thus by the well. It was about the sixth hour.|In this verse, the imagery of Jesus sitting at Jacob's well emphasizes both the historical significance of the location and the physical fatigue of Jesus after His journey. The term 'wearied' indicates a deep human experience, connecting the spiritual encounter that follows.|
|JHN 4:7|A woman of Samaria came to draw water. Jesus said to her, "Give Me a drink."|This translation aims to convey the literal meaning while also emphasizing the context of Jesus' interaction with the Samaritan woman. The word choice reflects the importance of both physical thirst and spiritual longing.|
|JHN 4:8|For His disciples had gone into the city to buy food.|The original Greek emphasizes the action of the disciples going into the city for sustenance. In this translation, I've opted for a more straightforward modern phrasing that captures their purpose without losing the essence of the original.|
|JHN 4:9|The Samaritan woman said to Him, 'How is it that you, a Jew, ask for a drink from me, a Samaritan woman?' For Jews have no dealings with Samaritans.|This verse highlights the cultural and religious tensions between Jews and Samaritans. The woman's surprise at Jesus' request illustrates the barriers that existed at the time, making His offer of living water all the more significant.|
|JHN 4:10|Jesus answered and said to her, 'If you knew the gift of God, and who it is that says to you, “Give Me a drink,” you would have asked Him, and He would have given you living water.'|This translation aims to preserve the depth of Jesus' offer of spiritual sustenance and highlights the concept of God's gift to humanity. The phrase 'living water' has been interpreted to convey not just physical water, but spiritual life and renewal.|
|JHN 4:11|The woman said to Him, 'Sir, You have no bucket, and the well is deep. Where then do You get that living water?'|In this verse, the woman's response reflects her confusion and disbelief regarding Jesus' claim about living water. The words 'άντλημα' (draw) and 'φρέαρ' (well) illustrate the practical aspects of water sourcing in her culture, while 'ὕδωρ τὸ ζῶν' (living water) indicates a spiritual significance that Jesus is communicating.|
|JHN 4:12|Are You greater than our father Jacob, who gave us the well and drank from it himself, as did his sons and his livestock?|In this verse, Jesus is engaging the woman at the well, using Jacob's well as a point of reference to illustrate the distinction between earthly and spiritual gifts. The term 'greater' is emphasized to show Jesus' superior status compared to Jacob.|
|JHN 4:13|Jesus answered and said to her, "Everyone who drinks of this water will thirst again.|This verse emphasizes the temporary satisfaction of physical thirst compared to the eternal satisfaction found in Christ. The choice of words such as 'drink' and 'thirst' resonate with the deep longing of the soul for spiritual fulfillment.|
|JHN 4:14|But whoever drinks of the water that I will give him shall never thirst again; rather, the water that I give him will become in him a well of water springing up to eternal life.|This verse emphasizes the contrast between the physical thirst that comes from drinking ordinary water and the spiritual satisfaction offered through the water that Jesus gives, which leads to eternal life. The terms 'water' and 'thirst' symbolize deeper spiritual truths about life and fulfillment.|
|JHN 4:15|The woman said to Him, "Sir, give me this water, so that I will not thirst, nor come here to draw again."|This verse captures the woman's request for the water Jesus offers, emphasizing her need to quench her thirst without the burden of drawing water from the well continually. The phrase "give me this water" shows her longing for relief from her physical thirst and the implications of a deeper spiritual need.|
|JHN 4:16|Jesus said to her, 'Go, call your husband and come here.'|This verse captures the moment when Jesus invites the woman at the well to engage with Him more personally by bringing her husband, reflecting His knowledge and the desire for her to confront her circumstances. The invitation carries a sense of urgency and intimacy, encouraging a deeper interaction.|
|JHN 4:17|The woman answered him, 'I have no husband.' Jesus said to her, 'You are correct in saying, ‘I have no husband.’'|In this passage, the woman responds to Jesus about her marital status. The translation seeks to preserve the nuance of her honesty and Jesus’ recognition of her truthfulness. The phrase 'I have no husband' indicates her acknowledgment of her current situation, while Jesus affirms her statement as accurate.|
|JHN 4:18|For you have had five husbands, and the man you now have is not your husband. What you have said is true.|In this verse, Jesus addresses the woman's relationship history, revealing her past without condemnation. The terms used for 'husband' and 'man' convey a sense of ownership and recognition of truth. The structure maintains the original emphasis on the truthfulness of her admission.|
|JHN 4:19|The woman said to Him, 'Sir, I perceive that You are a prophet.'|In this verse, the woman recognizes Jesus as a prophet. The term 'prophet' in the original Greek text is ‘προφήτης’ (prophētēs), which conveys the idea of someone who speaks on behalf of God or conveys divine truths. This acknowledgment is significant because it marks a shift from viewing Jesus merely as a Jewish teacher to recognizing his prophetic role, indicating a deeper understanding of his identity.|
|JHN 4:20|Our fathers worshiped on this mountain, but you say that in Jerusalem is the place where people ought to worship.|In this verse, the woman speaks about the practice of worship in relation to geographical locations, highlighting the differences in traditions between her people and the Jews. The fresh translation aims to convey both the literal meaning and the theological implications of worship as understood in the New Testament context.|
|JHN 4:21|Jesus said to her, 'Woman, believe Me, the time is coming when you will neither worship the Father on this mountain nor in Jerusalem.'|In this verse, Jesus indicates a pivotal shift in the understanding of worship. The phrase 'the hour is coming' signifies a prophetic change, where location becomes less important than the manner of worship. The term 'worship' (προσκυνήσετε) highlights reverence, and the mention of 'the Father' underscores the intimate relationship believers have with God. The original Greek implies a contrast to previous practices of worship bound by location.|
|JHN 4:22|You worship what you do not know; we worship what we know, for salvation is from the Jews.|In this verse, Jesus contrasts the worship practices of the Samaritans and the Jews. He emphasizes that while the Samaritans worship what they do not understand, the Jews have a clearer understanding of God's revelation and the source of salvation. The term 'worship' (προσκυνέω) is significant in both the Old and New Testament, relating to reverence and adoration due to God.|
|JHN 4:23|Yet the hour is coming, and now is here, when the true worshipers will worship the Father in spirit and in truth; for the Father seeks such people to be his worshipers.|This translation emphasizes the necessity of genuine worship characterized by both spirit and truth, reflecting the deep relational aspect of worship that transcends physical location and mere ritualistic practice.|
|JHN 4:24|God is spirit, and those who worship him must worship in spirit and truth.|This verse emphasizes the dual aspect of worship in both the spiritual realm and the necessity of truthfulness. The terms 'spirit' and 'truth' highlight the profound connection between God and genuine worship. 'Spirit' refers to the inner aspect of worship that transcends physical forms, while 'truth' indicates alignment with God's reality and nature.|
|JHN 4:25|The woman said to him, "I know that the Messiah is coming, the one called Christ. When he comes, he will declare all things to us."|The term 'Messiah' in Hebrew translates to 'the anointed one,' which directly corresponds to the Greek term 'Christos.' In this verse, the woman acknowledges her understanding of the Messiah's role as a teacher and revealer of truth, anticipating his coming as an important event that will clarify all things.|
|JHN 4:26|Jesus said to her, "I who speak to you am he."|In this verse, Jesus identifies himself directly, affirming his role as the Messiah. The phrase 'I am' carries significant theological weight, referencing God's self-revelation in the Old Testament and highlighting the divinity of Christ. This direct statement from Jesus is a powerful confirmation of his identity to the Samaritan woman.|
|JHN 4:27|And at that moment, His disciples came, and they were amazed that He was speaking with a woman; yet no one said, "What do you seek?" or, "Why are you talking with her?"|This verse captures the disciples' astonishment at Jesus conversing with a woman, which reflects cultural norms of the time regarding gender interactions and the unexpected nature of Jesus' ministry. The phrasing is structured to maintain the original tone of surprise and curiosity without losing the context of the disciples' perspective.|
|JHN 4:28|So the woman left her water jar and went into the city, and she said to the people:|This verse depicts a pivotal moment where the woman leaves her water jar, symbolizing her transformation and urgency to share her encounter with Jesus. The action of leaving the jar signifies the importance of spiritual sustenance over physical needs. The verb 'ἀπῆλθεν' (went away) highlights her movement towards the community to witness about Jesus, reflecting the call to evangelism present in the related verses.|
|JHN 4:29|Come, see a man who told me everything I ever did. Could this be the Christ?|In this verse, the woman's exclamation is both a question and a declaration. It reflects her amazement and curiosity about Jesus' knowledge of her past. The use of the term 'Christ' indicates her recognition of Jesus' potential messianic identity.|
|JHN 4:30|So they left the city and began their journey toward Him.|The phrase ‘come to Him’ indicates an action of approaching Jesus, following the invitation expressed in the previous verse. The word 'city' here refers to the place from which the people are coming, highlighting the contrast between their previous location and the destination where Jesus is located. The tense used reflects immediacy, indicating that the people are actively moving toward Him.|
|JHN 4:31|Meanwhile, the disciples urged Him, saying, "Rabbi, eat."|In this verse, the disciples refer to Jesus as 'Rabbi', which denotes their respect and recognition of His authority as a teacher. The phrase 'φαγε' emphasizes the physical need for sustenance, reflecting a common theme in the Gospels where physical needs are presented alongside spiritual teachings.|
|JHN 4:32|But He said to them, 'I have food to eat that you do not know about.'|In this verse, Jesus contrasts the physical sustenance that the disciples are concerned about with a deeper, spiritual nourishment that they do not yet understand. The phrase 'I have food to eat' is significant as it emphasizes the spiritual mission of Jesus, which transcends mere physical needs. The verb 'φαγεῖν' indicates an ongoing action of consuming, which implies that the nourishment He speaks of is meant to be internalized rather than simply consumed externally.|
|JHN 4:33|Therefore, the disciples said to one another, 'Did someone bring Him food?'|This verse captures the confusion of the disciples as they question one another about whether someone has brought Jesus food. It highlights their misunderstanding of His statement about spiritual sustenance.|
|JHN 4:34|Jesus said to them, 'My food is to do the will of Him who sent me and to finish His work.'|In this verse, Jesus emphasizes the significance of fulfilling the mission assigned to Him by God. The terms 'my food' and 'to do the will' indicate a deeper spiritual nourishment that comes from obedience and purpose, reflecting the relationship between the messenger and the one who sent him. The use of 'finish His work' suggests a commitment to completion and purpose.|
|JHN 4:35|Do you not say, ‘There are still four months until the harvest’? Behold, I say to you, lift up your eyes and look at the fields, for they are already white for harvest.|In this verse, Jesus uses the metaphor of a harvest to illustrate the urgency and readiness of the spiritual work at hand. The phrase 'lift up your eyes' signifies the need for awareness and action, while 'white for harvest' emphasizes the immediate availability of souls ready to receive the Gospel. The term 'four months' represents a common understanding of the agricultural cycle, contrasting with the spiritual reality that harvest is ready now.|
|JHN 4:36|And he who reaps receives wages and gathers fruit for eternal life, so that both he who sows and he who reaps may rejoice together.|In this verse, the metaphor of harvest is significant. It emphasizes the rewards that come from diligent labor in God's service and the joy that accompanies the shared experience of sowing and reaping. The use of 'eternal life' highlights the spiritual aspect of the harvest.|
|JHN 4:37|For in this is the true saying, 'One sows and another reaps.'|In this verse, the distinction between the one who sows and the one who reaps highlights the cooperative nature of evangelism and spiritual harvest. The words used emphasize the roles in God's harvest, where both are essential and have distinct functions.|
|JHN 4:38|I sent you to reap what you have not labored for; others have worked hard, and you have entered into their labor.|This verse emphasizes the collaborative nature of ministry and the fulfillment of God's work through the efforts of others. The contrast between those who labor and those who benefit from their work highlights the community aspect of faith and service.|
|JHN 4:39|And many of the Samaritans from that city believed in him because of the woman's testimony, saying, "He told me everything I ever did."|This verse emphasizes the significant impact of the Samaritan woman's testimony, leading many to believe in Jesus. The use of 'believed' conveys a deep conviction based on personal experience, aligning with themes found in other passages about faith and witness.|
|JHN 4:40|So when the Samaritans came to him, they urged him to stay with them, and he stayed there for two days.|This verse highlights the hospitality of the Samaritans and their desire to learn more from Jesus. The word 'μεῖναι' emphasizes their request for him to stay, which indicates their willingness to receive his teachings over a period of time. The two days he stayed symbolizes the deepening of their faith and understanding during his time with them.|
|JHN 4:41|And many more believed because of His word.|This verse emphasizes the impact of Jesus' words on the faith of the people, highlighting a theme prevalent in the Gospel of John where belief is often linked to the power of Jesus’ teachings. The phrase 'many more' indicates a significant increase in faith among the Samaritans after their encounter with Him.|
|JHN 4:42|And they said to the woman, "Now we believe, not because of what you said; for we ourselves have heard Him and we know that this is indeed the Savior of the world, the Christ."|In this verse, the transition from belief due to the woman's testimony to belief from personal experience underscores the personal relationship one develops with Christ. The term 'Savior' and 'Christ' is pivotal in understanding Jesus' role as the Redeemer of the world, emphasizing His divine mission.|
|JHN 4:43|After the two days, He departed from there and went to Galilee.|This verse indicates the movement of Jesus after spending two days in Samaria, highlighting His return to Galilee, where He was from. The use of 'went out' and 'departed' helps convey a sense of journey and purpose in His ministry.|
|JHN 4:44|For Jesus Himself testified that a prophet has no honor in his own country.|This verse reflects the sentiment that a prophet, despite his divine mission and authority, often does not receive the respect or recognition in his own familiar surroundings. The Greek term 'τιμὴν' emphasizes the lack of honor, which ties closely to the cultural context of recognition and esteem.|
|JHN 4:45|So when He came to Galilee, the Galileans welcomed Him, having seen all the things He did in Jerusalem at the feast; for they also had gone to the feast.|In this verse, the term 'Galileans' refers to the people of Galilee who received Jesus upon His arrival, demonstrating their recognition of His previous works in Jerusalem. The use of 'received' indicates acceptance and acknowledgment of His authority based on their prior observations of His miracles.|
|JHN 4:46|So Jesus came again to Cana of Galilee, where He had made the water wine. And there was a certain royal official whose son was sick at Capernaum.|This translation aims to capture the original intent of the Greek text while using contemporary English that resonates with readers today. The mention of Jesus returning to Cana serves as a crucial connection to His earlier miracle of turning water into wine, establishing the context of His authority and miraculous power.|
|JHN 4:47|When this man heard that Jesus had come from Judea into Galilee, he went to Him and implored Him to come down and heal his son, for he was at the point of death.|This verse describes a royal official's urgent plea to Jesus to heal his son, reflecting both desperation and faith in Jesus' healing power. The choice of words emphasizes the official's social status and the gravity of the situation with his son's impending death.|
|JHN 4:48|Jesus said to him, "Unless you see signs and wonders, you will not believe."|In this verse, Jesus highlights a critical aspect of faith, emphasizing that mere witnessing of signs and wonders does not lead to true belief. The wording captures the contrast between shallow faith, based solely on miraculous evidence, and the deeper, more genuine faith that is necessary for a true relationship with Him.|
|JHN 4:49|The royal official said to him, "Sir, come down before my child dies."|In this translation, I have maintained the urgency and the heartfelt plea of the royal official for Jesus to come quickly to heal his son, capturing both the emotion and the desperation of the situation.

|JHN 4:50|Jesus replied, "Go; your son is alive." The man believed the word that Jesus spoke to him, and he departed.|The phrase 'Your son lives' indicates a restoration of life, emphasizing the miraculous nature of Jesus' words. The emphasis is placed on belief in Jesus' spoken word, which aligns with the overall theme of faith throughout the Gospel of John.|
|JHN 4:51|As he was descending, his servants met him and reported, saying, 'Your son is alive!'|This verse conveys the joy of the servants as they bring good news to the nobleman. The Greek verb ἀπήγγειλαν (they reported) indicates a sense of urgency and happiness, reflecting the importance of the news about the boy's well-being. The word ‘ζῇ’ (is alive) emphasizes the miraculous aspect of the event, reinforcing the faith that Jesus has in his words. This connection to belief is a central theme in the preceding and subsequent verses, highlighting the power of faith in the context of healing.|
|JHN 4:52|So he asked them at what hour he had begun to get better. They told him that yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him.|This verse captures the moment of realization for the father regarding the timing of his son's healing. The word 'ἑβδόμην' (seventh) is key in connecting the miraculous event with the time frame provided by the servants. This translation aims to maintain clarity while conveying the emotional gravity of the father's understanding.|
|JHN 4:53|So the father knew that it was at that very hour when Jesus had said to him, 'Your son lives.' And he himself believed, along with his entire household.|This verse emphasizes the recognition of healing and the immediate belief that followed, highlighting the theme of faith and its impact on both the father and his entire household.|
|JHN 4:54|This was the second miraculous sign that Jesus performed when He came from Judea into Galilee.|In this verse, the term 'sign' refers to a miraculous act that serves as a confirmation of divine authority or identity.
