| Reference | Verse | Translation Notes |
|:---------:|-------|-------------------|
|MRK 3:1|And he entered again into the synagogue; and there was a man there who had a withered hand.|The term 'withered hand' reflects the condition of the man's hand, emphasizing physical ailment and disability, which sets the stage for a miraculous healing. The term 'synagogue' is translated directly as it denotes the place of worship relevant to the context of Jesus’ ministry.|
|MRK 3:2|And they closely observed Him to see if He would heal him on the Sabbath, so that they might accuse Him.|This verse highlights the tension between the strict interpretation of Sabbath laws held by the Pharisees and the compassionate actions of Jesus. The phrase 'to heal on the Sabbath' is significant as it points to the debate over what constitutes proper observance of the Sabbath.|
|MRK 3:3|And He said to the man with the withered hand, "Stand up in the middle."|This translation aims to convey the command and the urgency in Jesus' words to the man with the withered hand, emphasizing the act of rising up and taking a stand among the gathered audience.|
|MRK 3:4|And He said to them, "Is it lawful to do good or to do harm on the Sabbath? To save a life or to kill?" But they were silent.|In this verse, Jesus challenges the traditional understanding of Sabbath observance by emphasizing the importance of doing good and preserving life. The use of 'good' (ἀγαθοποιῆσαι) and 'evil' (κακοποιῆσαι) sets a moral framework for the discussion of actions permissible on the Sabbath. The rhetorical question reflects Jesus’ authority and invites deeper contemplation among His listeners regarding the nature of God's law and mercy.|
|MRK 3:5|And after looking around at them with anger, grieved by the hardness of their hearts, He said to the man, "Stretch out your hand." He stretched it out, and his hand was restored to full health, just like the other.|In this verse, Jesus exhibits both righteous anger and deep compassion. The terms used for 'anger' and 'hardness of heart' reflect a profound concern for human suffering and the spiritual state of those who are unwilling to empathize. The command to 'stretch out your hand' is not only a physical act but a call to restoration and healing, symbolizing faith and obedience.|
|MRK 3:6|And the Pharisees went out, and immediately they began to conspire with the Herodians against Him, how they might put Him to death.|This verse reflects the collusion between the Pharisees and Herodians against Jesus. The use of 'conspire' conveys a sense of plotting and scheming, indicating their serious intent to oppose Him. The phrase 'that they might destroy Him' captures their desire to eliminate Jesus, highlighting the conflict between Him and the religious leaders of the time.|
|MRK 3:7|And Jesus withdrew with His disciples to the sea; and a great multitude from Galilee followed Him.|In this verse, the phrase 'the multitude from Galilee followed him' indicates the significant interest and desire of the people to be near Jesus. The term 'multitude' denotes a large gathering, emphasizing the popularity and influence of Jesus during His ministry in Galilee.|
|MRK 3:8|And from Judea, Jerusalem, Idumea, beyond the Jordan, and the regions around Tyre and Sidon, a vast crowd came to Him, having heard about all the things He was doing.|This verse emphasizes the extensive geographical reach of Jesus' ministry, noting the various regions and the great number of people who came to hear Him. The mention of different locations underlines the significant impact of His works, and the use of the term 'multitude' conveys a sense of urgency and need for His teachings.|
|MRK 3:9|And He instructed His disciples to have a small boat ready for Him because of the crowd, so that they would not crush Him.|This translation aims to capture the urgency and intent of Jesus asking for a boat to avoid being pressed upon by the crowd. The term 'boat' (πλοιάριον) is used in a diminutive sense to indicate a small vessel, emphasizing the need for space rather than a larger ship. 'Pressing upon' (θλίβωσιν) conveys a sense of physical pressure or overwhelming numbers that could hinder Jesus' ministry.|
|MRK 3:10|For He had healed many, so that those who were troubled pressed in around Him to touch Him.|In this verse, the emphasis is on the overwhelming need of the people who sought to touch Jesus, particularly those afflicted by various ailments. The term used for 'suffering' relates closely to the various diseases and conditions mentioned in other Gospel accounts. The word 'many' underlines the significant number of people drawn to Him for healing.|
|MRK 3:11|And whenever the unclean spirits saw Him, they fell down before Him and cried out, saying, 'You are the Son of God!'|In this verse, the unclean spirits recognize Jesus' divine nature and identity as the Son of God. The term 'unclean spirits' highlights the spiritual opposition to God, while their acknowledgment of Jesus’ identity emphasizes His authority over evil. The phrase structure mimics the directness of their proclamation, enhancing the immediacy of their recognition.|
|MRK 3:12|And he sternly warned them not to make him known.|In this verse, the Greek word 'ἐπετίμα' (epetima) implies a strong rebuke or command. The use of 'φάνερον' (phaneron) refers to revealing or making something known. Thus, the translation focuses on the authority of Jesus and his command to silence the spirits. It captures the essence of Jesus instructing the spirits not to reveal his true identity to the public at this point in his ministry.|
|MRK 3:13|And He went up to the mountain, and called to Himself those whom He desired, and they came to Him.|In this translation, I have chosen to use 'He went up to the mountain' for 'ἀναβαίνει εἰς τὸ ὄρος' to preserve the geographical and spiritual significance of the act. 'Called to Himself' reflects the personal invitation of Jesus, while 'those He wanted' captures the intention behind the selection without implying exclusivity in a negative sense. This context emphasizes Jesus' authority and choice in gathering His followers.|
|MRK 3:14|And He appointed twelve, that they might be with Him, and that He might send them out to proclaim.|This translation maintains the essence of Jesus' appointment of the twelve disciples, emphasizing His intention for them to be with Him and to be sent out for ministry.|
|MRK 3:15|and to have authority to heal diseases and to cast out demons.|This verse emphasizes the authority given to the disciples for healing and casting out demons, which is consistent with the mission of Christ and His apostles. The translation aims to capture the active role of authority and healing.|
|MRK 3:16|And He gave the name Peter to Simon.|The verse focuses on the moment Jesus renames Simon to Peter, highlighting the significance of this new identity in relation to his role in the church. The name 'Peter' means 'rock,' symbolizing strength and stability.|
|MRK 3:17|And He named James, the son of Zebedee, and John, the brother of James; He gave them the name Boanerges, which means Sons of Thunder.|In this verse, Jesus gives a new name to James and John, reflecting their role and nature as disciples. The name 'Boanerges,' which means 'Sons of Thunder,' suggests their strong and fiery personalities. This term highlights their passion and zeal for the mission ahead. The Greek term 'βροντή' means 'thunder,' and its connection to the personalities of the two brothers is crucial in understanding their character as portrayed in the Gospels.|
|MRK 3:18|And Andrew, and Philip, and Bartholomew, and Matthew, and Thomas, and James the son of Alphaeus, and Thaddeus, and Simon the Zealot.|In this verse, the names of the disciples are mentioned. Care has been taken to preserve the order and specific naming as found in the original Greek. The cultural and historical significance of the names is acknowledged, reflecting their identities in the early Christian community.|
|MRK 3:19|and Judas Iscariot, who also betrayed Him.|The phrase "ὃς καὶ παρέδωκεν αὐτόν" translates to 'who also delivered Him up' indicating Judas Iscariot's role in the betrayal of Jesus. In this fresh translation, emphasis is placed on the betrayal as a pivotal moment in the narrative.|
|MRK 3:20|And they entered a house; and again a crowd gathered, so that they were not even able to eat bread.|This verse highlights the pressing nature of the crowds surrounding Jesus, indicating their eagerness to be near Him, which becomes so overwhelming that it disrupts His basic needs. The phrase 'could not even eat bread' suggests a severe lack of personal space and time for nourishment.|
|MRK 3:21|And when His family heard of this, they went out to seize Him, for they said, 'He is out of His mind.'|The term 'κρατῆσαι' conveys the idea of attempting to seize or control someone, while 'ἐξέστη' indicates a state of being beside oneself or astonishment. This context reveals the family's concern about Jesus's mental state and their intention to take Him away from the overwhelming crowd.|
|MRK 3:22|And the scribes who had come down from Jerusalem were saying, 'He is possessed by Beelzebul, and by the chief of demons, He casts out demons.'|In this translation, I have used 'scribes' to reflect the authority of the religious leaders of the time. The term 'Beelzebul' is maintained as it is a specific name that carries cultural significance, linking to ancient Near Eastern traditions. 'Ruler of demons' highlights the belief they attributed to Jesus' power over evil spirits, echoing the conflict between good and evil central to the Gospel message.|
|MRK 3:23|And calling them to Him, He spoke to them in parables, saying, 'How can Satan cast out Satan?'|In this verse, Jesus uses a rhetorical question to illustrate the absurdity of the accusation against Him. The term 'Satan' is significant, as it refers to the adversary in the spiritual realm, emphasizing the contrast between His work and that of evil forces. The term 'cast out' ('ἐκβάλλειν') suggests authority over demons, reinforcing the power of Jesus' ministry.|
|MRK 3:24|And if a kingdom is divided against itself, that kingdom cannot stand.|This verse illustrates the principle of unity necessary for any kingdom or authority to remain effective and withstand challenges. The emphasis on division and its consequences is crucial in understanding the nature of conflict within a community or kingdom.|
|MRK 3:25|And if a house is divided against itself, that house cannot stand.|This translation emphasizes the theme of division within a household, reflecting the original Greek structure while maintaining clarity for modern readers.|
|MRK 3:26|And if Satan rises up against himself and is divided, he cannot stand, but his end has come.|This verse presents the idea of internal division leading to destruction, emphasizing that a unified entity cannot thrive if it turns against itself. The focus is on the futility of self-destruction, using strong language to illustrate the consequences of internal conflict.|
|MRK 3:27|No one can enter the strong man’s house and plunder his goods unless he first binds the strong man; then indeed he may plunder his house.|In this verse, the strong man symbolizes a powerful entity (often interpreted as Satan), and the act of binding represents the necessity of overcoming opposition before taking action. This fresh translation emphasizes the sequence of actions needed to successfully overcome and take possession.|
|MRK 3:28|Truly, I say to you, all sins will be forgiven to the sons of men, and whatever blasphemies they may utter.|This verse emphasizes the extent of God's forgiveness, indicating that all sins and blasphemies are forgivable except for blasphemy against the Holy Spirit. The use of 'Amen' at the beginning highlights the certainty of the statement being made.|
|MRK 3:29|But whoever blasphemes against the Holy Spirit will never find forgiveness; he is guilty of an eternal sin.|This verse emphasizes the severity of blaspheming the Holy Spirit, indicating it is an unforgivable sin that has eternal consequences. The Greek term used, "βλασφημήσῃ" (blaspheme), denotes a serious offense against God, specifically in rejecting His Spirit. The emphasis on eternal judgment underscores the gravity of this act, distinguishing it from other sins that can be forgiven.|
|MRK 3:30|For they were saying, 'He has an unclean spirit.'|This verse highlights the accusation made against Jesus regarding his authority and power over demons, emphasizing the spiritual opposition he faced. The term 'unclean spirit' used here corresponds with other references to demonic forces in the Gospels, indicating a direct link to the idea of spiritual corruption and the conflict between Jesus and evil.|
|MRK 3:31|Then His mother and His brothers came, standing outside and sending to Him, calling for Him.|The phrase 'came' indicates a physical movement, and 'mother and brothers' refers to Jesus' immediate family. The term 'outside' suggests they were not in the same location as Jesus, while 'calling to Him' implies urgency in their request. The structure is designed to highlight both the familial relationship and the contrast between earthly ties and spiritual commitments, particularly in the context of the accusation made about Jesus in the previous verse.|
|MRK 3:32|And a crowd was sitting around Him, and they said to Him, "Look, Your mother and Your brothers are outside, seeking You."|In this verse, the focus is on the crowd surrounding Jesus and their announcement regarding His family outside. The terms used highlight the familial relationship while also portraying the notion of seeking or searching, common themes throughout the Gospels.|
|MRK 3:33|And He answered them, saying, "Who are My mother and My brothers?"|In this verse, Jesus is responding to a statement about His family, using a rhetorical question that challenges conventional views of family ties. This reflects a broader theme in His teaching about spiritual relationships over biological ones.|
|MRK 3:34|And looking around at those seated in a circle around Him, He said, "Behold, My mother and My brothers!"|This verse emphasizes the relational aspect of Jesus' family, distinguishing between physical family ties and spiritual kinship based on faith and discipleship. The use of 'mother' and 'brothers' in the context highlights the importance of those who follow Jesus as part of His spiritual family.|
|MRK 3:35|For whoever does the will of God, this one is my brother, and my sister, and my mother.|In this verse, the emphasis is on the familial ties that are formed through obedience to God's will.
