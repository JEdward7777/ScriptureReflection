They were testing him.|In this verse, the term 'Pharisees' signifies the Jewish religious leaders who often challenged Jesus. The phrase 'testing him' indicates their intention to trap Jesus with difficult questions regarding the law.

The phrase captures the essence of the dispute between Jesus and the Pharisees regarding the allowances for divorce in Mosaic Law.|
|MRK 10:5|Jesus replied, "It was because of your hard hearts that Moses wrote you this commandment."|The term 'hardness of heart' (σκληροκαρδία) signifies a stubbornness or refusal to heed God's commandments. In this context, it refers to the inability or unwillingness of the people to embrace God's design for marriage as intended from creation. The commandment mentioned relates to a concession made by Moses in response to the prevailing hardness of their hearts rather than God's ideal.|
|MRK 10:6|But from the very beginning of creation, God made them male and female.|The verse emphasizes the divine intention behind the creation of male and female, reflecting God's purpose from the beginning.

|MRK 10:9|Therefore, what God has united, let no human separate.|This verse emphasizes the divine intention behind marriage, highlighting that it is God who joins a couple together, establishing a bond that should not be severed by human actions.

|MRK 10:13|And people were bringing little children to Him, so that He might touch them; but the disciples rebuked those who brought them.|The verse emphasizes the importance of children in the eyes of Jesus and contrasts the warm reception He gives them with the stern attitude of the disciples.

|MRK 10:14|But when Jesus saw this, he became indignant and said to them, "Let the little children come to me; do not stop them, for to such belongs the kingdom of God."|In this translation, the key terms 'children' and 'kingdom of God' are emphasized to reflect their significance in the context of Jesus' teachings. The phrase 'let the children come' is used to convey Jesus' invitation and the urgency behind it, while 'do not hinder them' captures the disciples' misunderstanding of Jesus' openness to the vulnerable and innocent.|

|MRK 10:16|And taking them in his arms, he blessed them, placing his hands upon them.|The verb 'ἐναγκαλισάμενος' is translated as 'embracing', indicating a tender and welcoming action. The phrase 'κατηυλόγει' signifies the act of blessing, a common practice in biblical narratives, especially in the context of children and Jesus' ministry. The hands being placed 'upon them' conveys the notion of both blessing and impartation of grace, which is characteristic of Jesus' interactions with the vulnerable.|
|MRK 10:17|As he was setting out on his journey, a man ran up to him, knelt before him, and asked, "Good Teacher, what must I do to inherit eternal life?"|In this fresh translation, the focus is on maintaining the core meaning of the original text while rendering it into smooth, contemporary English.

|MRK 10:18|Jesus said to him, 'Why do you call me good? No one is good except God alone.'|In this verse, Jesus challenges the notion of 'goodness' ascribed to Him by the questioner.

Each command reflects a foundational principle of conduct within the Judeo-Christian ethic, and is vital for understanding the nature of sin and societal responsibility in the context of Christ's teachings.|

|MRK 10:23|And looking around, Jesus said to His disciples, "How hard it is for those who have riches to enter the kingdom of God!"|This verse emphasizes the difficulty that those who possess wealth face in entering the kingdom of God. The choice of words reflects the concern for material possessions versus spiritual values, mirroring other teachings in the Gospels.|
|MRK 10:24|But the disciples were astonished at His words. Jesus answered them again, saying, "Children, how hard it is for those who trust in riches to enter the kingdom of God!"|In this verse, Jesus is addressing the disciples with a tone of warning and teaching. The word 'difficult' (δύσκολόν) emphasizes the struggle of those who rely on wealth rather than on God. The term 'trusting in riches' (πεποιθότας ἐπὶ χρήμασιν) indicates a misplaced reliance, contrasting with the need for faith in God to enter His kingdom.|

Key terms such as 'house', 'brother', 'mother', 'sister', and 'lands' underline the personal sacrifices one makes for faith.|
|MRK 10:30|but he will receive a hundredfold now in this time—houses, brothers, sisters, mothers, children, and fields, along with persecutions; and in the age to come, eternal life.|This translation emphasizes the reward that Jesus promises to those who sacrifice for Him and the Gospel. The use of 'hundredfold' captures the essence of the original Greek phrase 'ἑκατονταπλασίονα', while ensuring clarity in modern English.|
|MRK 10:31|But many who are regarded as first will be last, and many who are regarded as last will be first.|The phrase emphasizes a reversal of expectations regarding status and position in the kingdom of God. The first will find themselves in a lesser position, while those considered last will be exalted.|

The use of strong verbs emphasizes the physical and emotional abuse He would face.|
|MRK 10:35|Then James and John, the sons of Zebedee, approached Him, saying, "Teacher, we want You to do for us whatever we ask of You."|The request made by James and John is significant as it reveals their understanding of Jesus' authority and their desire for position. Their approach to Jesus as 'Teacher' indicates respect, while their request showcases a misunderstanding of His impending suffering. The verb 'ποιήσῃς' (to do) is notable as it highlights their expectation of action from Jesus in response to their request.|
|MRK 10:36|But He said to them, 'What do you want Me to do for you?'|In this translation, I focus on conveying the directness of Jesus' inquiry while capturing the informal and relational nature of the conversation.

This reflects Jesus' mission and the commitment required of his disciples to follow him in their own trials.|

|MRK 10:43|Yet it shall not be so among you. Whoever desires to be great among you must become your servant.|In this verse, Jesus contrasts the behavior expected of His followers with that of secular leaders.

The verb 'γενέσθαι' suggests a becoming or transforming into something, emphasizing a change in attitude and behavior for those aspiring to leadership among believers.|
|MRK 10:44|And whoever desires to be first among you shall be the servant of all.|In this verse, the emphasis is on the concept of servitude as a virtue, aligning with the teachings of Christ on humility and leadership.
