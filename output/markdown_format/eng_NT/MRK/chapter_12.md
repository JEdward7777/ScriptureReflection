|MRK 12:2|And at the proper time, he sent a servant to the tenants, so that he might receive from the tenants the fruit of the vineyard.|In this verse, the act of sending a servant signifies the owner's claim over the vineyard, while the phrase 'to receive from the farmers the fruit of the vineyard' emphasizes the expectation of yield from the hard work of the farmers.|

The use of 'stoned' and 'sent away dishonored' is significant in conveying the seriousness of the actions against those sent to appeal for repentance.|
|MRK 12:5|And again he sent another servant; and they killed that one too. Many others were sent, some they beat, and others they killed.|The original text employs a sequence of actions that reflect the treatment of the servants sent by the owner of the vineyard. The verbs used—'to send,' 'to kill,' and 'to wound'—are essential in conveying the increasing hostility faced by the messengers. The word 'ἀποκτείνω' specifically emphasizes the violent act of killing, while 'δέρω' indicates a beating that implies not only physical harm but also humiliation. This fresh translation seeks to maintain the dramatic tension present in the original Greek.|
|MRK 12:6|He had yet one more to send, a beloved son. Finally, he sent him to them, saying, 'They will surely respect my son.'|This verse depicts the poignant moment of a father sending his beloved son as a final attempt to reach the tenants of the vineyard. The term 'beloved' (ἀγαπητὸν) is deeply significant, highlighting the special relationship between the father and the son, mirroring similar biblical themes of divine sonship and sacrifice. The phrase 'they will respect my son' conveys the father's hope and expectation for a different response than what had been previously shown to the servants.|
|MRK 12:7|But those tenants said to one another, 'This is the heir. Come, let us kill him, and the inheritance will be ours.'|This verse emphasizes the murderous intentions of the tenants who, seeing the son, conspired to kill him, believing they could then claim the inheritance for themselves. The term 'heir' is crucial here, highlighting the son's status and the gravity of their plot.

|MRK 12:13|And they sent to Him some of the Pharisees and the Herodians to catch Him in His words.|This verse depicts the plot of the Pharisees and the Herodians against Jesus, highlighting their collaborative efforts to entrap Him. The choice of the words 'sent' and 'to catch' reflects their intention to outsmart Him with clever rhetoric. The phrase 'by word' indicates the method of their attempt to ensnare Him in His own teachings, an approach seen throughout the Gospels in the way His enemies challenged Him.|
|MRK 12:14|And when they came, they said to Him, 'Teacher, we know that You are true and that You do not regard the person of men, but teach the way of God in truth.

The phrase 'bring me a denarius' is a straightforward translation of 'φέρετέ μοι δηνάριον' and maintains clarity in the request for the coin to demonstrate His point regarding taxes.|
|MRK 12:16|They brought it to Him, and He said to them, "Whose likeness and inscription is this?" They replied, "Caesar's."|The phrase 'image and inscription' refers to the likeness and official markings that signify ownership or authority, pertinent in the context of Roman coinage and governance.|

The term 'left no offspring' is chosen to communicate the meaning of 'οὐδὲ αὐτὸς [οὐκ] ἀφῆκε σπέρμα' with clarity, emphasizing the absence of children without introducing ambiguity.|
|MRK 12:22|And the seven took her, and they left no offspring. Last of all, the woman died.|The phrase 'the seven took her' indicates a succession of marriages as per the Levirate law, reflecting the cultural practice of preserving a family line.

It emphasizes the importance of knowing the Scriptures to avoid being led astray.|
|MRK 12:25|For when they rise from the dead, they neither marry nor are given in marriage, but are like angels in the heavens.|This verse highlights the nature of existence after resurrection, contrasting earthly relationships with the divine state of being like angels. The use of 'marry' and 'given in marriage' signifies the earthly practices that are not present in the heavenly realm, emphasizing the transformed nature of resurrected beings.|
|MRK 12:26|But concerning the dead, that they rise again, have you not read in the book of Moses, at the burning bush, how God spoke to him, saying, 'I am the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob'?|In this translation, I have emphasized the divine continuity of God's relationship with the patriarchs and the implication of resurrection. The phrase 'I am' highlights God's eternal existence, and the focus is on the present tense, reflecting the belief that the patriarchs live on through God.|
|MRK 12:27|He is not the God of the dead, but of the living. Therefore, you are greatly mistaken.|This verse emphasizes the living nature of God and the belief in resurrection, contrasting the notion of being 'dead' with 'living' which aligns with Jesus' teachings on eternal life.|

And no one dared to ask Him any more questions.|In this translation, 'nunuichōs' is interpreted as responding thoughtfully or wisely, indicating the depth of the man's understanding of the command to love God and neighbor. The phrase 'οὐ μακρὰν εἶ' captures Jesus’ recognition of the man's insight and places him in close proximity to the kingdom of God. The final part emphasizes the growing hostility towards Jesus and His teachings, reflected in the words 'οὐδεὶς οὐκέτι ἐτόλμα αὐτὸν ἐπερωτῆσαι.'|

The translation uses 'great crowd' to reflect the original's implication of a significant gathering of people, emphasizing the communal aspect of the experience.|
|MRK 12:38|And he said to them in his teaching: "Beware of the scribes who desire to walk in long robes and love greetings in the marketplaces.|This verse highlights the behavior of the scribes, emphasizing their desire for outward appearance and recognition.

The translation aims to maintain the nuances of the original language while being accessible in English.|
|MRK 12:39|and the chief seats in the synagogues, and the places of honor at banquets.|The term 'first seats' or 'chief seats' implies a position of honor or prestige, particularly in religious gatherings. The mention of 'dinners' suggests social gatherings where status and rank are highlighted. The translation reflects the original Greek intention of criticizing the ostentation of religious leaders.|

These men will receive the greater judgment.|The phrase 'κατεσθίοντες τὰς οἰκίας τῶν χηρῶν' refers to the act of exploiting widows, symbolizing the deep moral corruption among the religious leaders. 'προφάσει μακρὰ προσευχόμενοι' suggests a facade of piety through lengthy prayers that hide their true intentions. The term 'κρῖμα' implies a judgment or condemnation that will come upon them for such actions.|

This passage emphasizes the value of sacrificial giving over the amount given.|
|MRK 12:43|And calling his disciples to him, he said to them, "Truly, I tell you, this poor widow has put in more than all those who are contributing to the treasury."|In this verse, the emphasis is placed on the sacrificial giving of the widow. The term 'poor' signifies her financial status, while 'greater than all' emphasizes the value of her offering in the sight of God, contrasting with the contributions of the rich who gave from their abundance. This serves to highlight the principle that God values the heart and intent behind the giving more than the actual monetary amount.|
|MRK 12:44|For they all contributed out of their abundance; but she, out of her poverty, has put in everything she had, all she had to live on.|In this verse, the emphasis is placed on the sacrificial nature of the widow's offering.
