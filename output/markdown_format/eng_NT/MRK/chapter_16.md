|MRK 16:1|And when the Sabbath was past, Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James, and Salome bought spices so that they might go and anoint Him.|This translation maintains the emphasis on the women preparing spices and the context of their actions in relation to Jesus’ burial. The term 'spices' is chosen to reflect the nature of the substances they were buying for anointing.|
|MRK 16:2|And very early on the first day of the week, as the sun was rising, they came to the tomb.|In this translation, the term 'very early' captures the urgency and significance of the time, while 'the first day of the week' indicates the dawning of a new era with the resurrection. The phrase 'after the Sabbath' emphasizes the transition from the rest of the Sabbath to the work of God in the resurrection. The mention of the sun rising evokes a sense of hope and new beginnings.|
|MRK 16:3|And they said to one another, "Who will roll away the stone for us from the entrance of the tomb?"|In this verse, the focus is on the concern of the women regarding the large stone sealing the tomb. The phrase 'who will roll away the stone' emphasizes their worry and lack of understanding about the divine power at work. The verb 'roll' is significant, as it conveys not just physical action but also hints at the supernatural events they will soon encounter. The translation aims to preserve the urgency and emotional state of the women as they approach the tomb.|
|MRK 16:4|And when they looked up, they saw that the stone had been rolled away; for it was exceedingly large.|The Greek word 'ἀναβλέψασαι' (anablepsasai) indicates a lifting of the eyes or looking up, suggesting a moment of revelation or clarity. 'θεωροῦσιν' (theōrousin) implies that they perceive or witness something significant. The phrase 'ἀποκεκύλισται ὁ λίθος' (apokekulistai ho lithos) indicates that the stone has been rolled away, emphasizing its great size and significance in the context of the resurrection. The use of 'μέγας σφόδρα' (megas sphodra) stresses the impressive nature of the stone's size, which is essential for the miraculous event that has just occurred.|
|MRK 16:5|And upon entering the tomb, they saw a young man sitting on the right side, clothed in a white robe, and they were greatly astonished.|The term 'young man' is used here in a similar context as seen in other accounts, denoting a figure of significance in the resurrection narrative. The description of the white robe emphasizes purity and divinity, which aligns with the traditional symbolism of angels in biblical texts.|
|MRK 16:6|But he said to them, "Do not be astonished; you seek Jesus of Nazareth, who was crucified. He has risen; He is not here. See the place where they laid Him.|The translation aims to maintain the original Greek structure while making it accessible in modern English. The key themes of astonishment, seeking, and resurrection are emphasized. The phrase 'Do not be astonished' conveys the imperative nature of the angel's command, which is an important aspect of the message of hope being delivered.|
|MRK 16:7|But go, tell His disciples and Peter, 'He is going ahead of you to Galilee; there you will see Him, just as He told you.'|In this verse, the emphasis is placed on the message that must be conveyed to the disciples, especially highlighting Peter's significance. The term 'go' denotes action and urgency, indicating the importance of spreading the news of Jesus' resurrection. 'See Him' underscores the promise of His appearance, which serves to reassure and guide the disciples after His resurrection.|
|MRK 16:8|And they went out and fled from the tomb, for trembling and astonishment had seized them, and they said nothing to anyone, for they were afraid.|The verse emphasizes the women’s reaction of fear and astonishment upon discovering the empty tomb. It highlights their immediate response, which was to flee in fear without communicating what they had seen, demonstrating the overwhelming impact of the resurrection announcement.|
|MRK 16:9|Now when Jesus rose early on the first day of the week, He appeared first to Mary Magdalene, from whom He had cast out seven demons.|The term 'ἀναστὰς' indicates resurrection, and 'πρωῒ πρώτῃ σαββάτου' is translated to reflect the time of day and the day of the week accurately. 'ἐφάνη' denotes appearance, which is significant as it introduces the event of Christ revealing Himself. The phrase 'ἀφ᾽ ἧς ἐκβεβλήκει ἑπτὰ δαιμόνια' emphasizes Mary's past deliverance from seven demons, establishing her as a witness to the resurrection.|
|MRK 16:10|She went and reported to those who had been with Him, who were mourning and weeping.|In this verse, the emphasis is on the action of Mary as she moves to convey the news of the resurrection to the disciples. The terms for mourning and weeping highlight the emotional state of the disciples after the crucifixion.|
|MRK 16:11|And when they heard that He was alive and had been seen by her, they did not believe.|This verse highlights the disbelief of the disciples in response to the news of Jesus’ resurrection. The Greek word 'ἀπίστησαν' indicates a strong skepticism, contrasting with their prior relationship with Him. The phrase emphasizes their shock and struggle to accept the miraculous event.|
|MRK 16:12|Afterward, He appeared in a different form to two of them as they were walking to the country.|The phrase 'ἐφάνερωθη ἐν ἑτέρᾳ μορφῇ' can be translated as 'was revealed in another form' which emphasizes the transformation or different appearance of Jesus in this encounter. The context of 'walking to the country' indicates a journey or movement towards a destination, which may symbolize the search for understanding or faith.|
|MRK 16:13|And they went and reported to the others; but they did not believe them.|This verse conveys the reaction of the disciples who were informed about the resurrection. The choice of 'reported' rather than 'told' captures the formal nature of their communication, while 'did not believe' emphasizes their disbelief in the reports of the resurrection, which is a key theme in the post-resurrection narratives.|
|MRK 16:14|Later, as they were reclining at the table, He appeared to the eleven and rebuked them for their unbelief and hardness of heart, because they had not believed those who had seen Him after He had risen.|This verse emphasizes the moment when Jesus appeared to the eleven disciples, confronting their disbelief and hard-heartedness. The use of 'revealed' highlights the divine nature of this appearance, while 'reproached' indicates the seriousness of their doubt given their prior experiences of His resurrection. 'Unbelief' and 'hardness of heart' are crucial in understanding their struggle to accept His resurrection, as they had been eyewitnesses to many of His miracles.|
|MRK 16:15|And He said to them, "Go into all the world and proclaim the good news to all creation."|This translation aims to maintain the essence of the original Greek text while making it accessible and understandable in modern English.

|MRK 16:16|Whoever believes and is baptized will be saved, but whoever does not believe will be condemned.|In this verse, the emphasis is on the connection between belief and baptism as prerequisites for salvation. The terms used for 'believes' and 'baptized' are crucial, indicating both faith and action. The future passive verbs signify the divine guarantee of salvation for believers.|
