|:---------:|-------|-------------------|
|MRK 4:1|Again, He began to teach by the sea. And a great multitude gathered around Him, so that He got into a boat and sat in it on the sea; and the whole multitude was on the shore.|In this translation, care is taken to maintain the meaning of gathering crowds by the sea and Jesus' action of teaching from a boat, reflecting the significance of water in biblical narratives and the authority of Jesus as a teacher.|
|MRK 4:2|And He taught them many things in parables, and said to them in His teaching:|In this translation, I emphasize the teaching method employed by Jesus, specifically His use of parables. The term 'parables' signifies a deeper truth conveyed through stories, which aligns with the nature of His teachings throughout the Gospels. Additionally, the word 'taught' signifies not just speaking but conveying lessons meant for understanding.|
|MRK 4:3|Listen! Behold, a sower went out to sow.|The phrase 'the sower went out to sow' emphasizes the active role of the sower, paralleling the work of spreading the Gospel. The use of 'Behold' calls for attention, indicating the importance of what is to follow. The translation seeks to maintain the imperative sense of 'Listen' or 'Hear' from the original Greek, which signifies an invitation to engage with the message.|
|MRK 4:4|And as he was sowing, some seed fell along the path, and the birds came and ate it up.|In this verse, the imagery of sowing and the immediate reaction of birds eating the seed emphasizes the vulnerability of the Word when it is not rooted in fertile soil. The use of the word 'sower' ties back to the overarching theme of receptivity to God's message. 'Birds' symbolize distractions or forces that come to consume the Word before it can take root.|
|MRK 4:5|And other seed fell on rocky ground, where there was not much soil, and it sprang up quickly because it had no depth of soil.|In this verse, the imagery of seed falling on rocky ground is used to illustrate the reception of God's Word. The terms 'rocky' and 'soil' are central to understanding the depth of spiritual commitment and growth. The use of 'depth' indicates the necessity for a solid foundation in faith to endure challenges.|
|MRK 4:6|But when the sun rose, it was scorched; and since it had no root, it withered away.|The phrase 'when the sun had risen' is used to depict the harsh conditions that lead to the withering of the plants, highlighting the lack of sufficient roots that would support the plants in such adversity.|
|MRK 4:7|And other seed fell among the thorns, and the thorns grew up and choked it, and it yielded no crop.|This verse highlights the dangers of the thorns, which symbolize worldly distractions and cares that can suffocate spiritual growth. The word 'choke' signifies the overwhelming nature of these distractions, leading to a lack of spiritual fruitfulness. The term 'fruit' here is metaphorical, referring to the results of a life influenced by the Gospel, including spiritual maturity and good works.|
|MRK 4:8|And other seed fell on the good ground, and it produced a crop that increased and grew, yielding thirtyfold, sixtyfold, and a hundredfold.|In this verse, the emphasis is placed on the good ground that receives the seed and yields fruit abundantly. The numerical yields (thirty, sixty, and a hundred) symbolize varying degrees of spiritual fruitfulness. The terms used are carefully chosen to convey the notion of growth and abundance in a spiritual context, reflecting the teaching of Jesus on the impact of the word of God.|
|MRK 4:9|And He said to them, 'Whoever has ears to listen, let him listen!'|This verse emphasizes the importance of listening and understanding spiritual truths. The phrase 'he who has ears to hear' implies a readiness to perceive deeper meanings, not merely hearing the words spoken. The call to listen serves as a challenge to the audience to engage thoughtfully with the message being presented.|
|MRK 4:10|When He was alone, those around Him with the twelve asked Him about the parable.|The term 'alone' is important to denote the setting of private inquiry among the disciples, emphasizing their desire for deeper understanding of the teachings of Jesus. The phrase 'those around Him' indicates a close group that was intimately connected to His ministry.|
|MRK 4:11|And He said to them, "To you has been granted to know the secrets of the kingdom of God; but to those who are outside, all things are done in parables."|This verse speaks to the distinction between those who are given understanding of God's kingdom and those who are not. The word 'mysteries' implies deep spiritual truths that are revealed to believers, while 'parables' indicate that the message may be concealed to others, requiring careful interpretation.|
|MRK 4:12|So that seeing they may see but not perceive, and hearing they may hear but not understand; otherwise they might turn, and their sins be forgiven them.|This verse highlights the paradox of seeing and not perceiving, and hearing but not understanding. It reflects the spiritual blindness that results from the rejection of God’s message, emphasizing a profound sense of lostness and the necessity of divine intervention for repentance.|
|MRK 4:13|And He said to them, 'Do you not understand this parable? How then will you understand all the parables?'|In this translation, the focus is on conveying the direct speech of Jesus and maintaining the structure and tone of His question. The use of 'know' in this context implies a deeper understanding of spiritual truths conveyed through parables. The reference to understanding all parables emphasizes the importance of grasping the underlying principles of Jesus’ teachings.|
|MRK 4:14|The sower sows the word.|In this translation, I aim to convey the essence of the original Greek phrase, focusing on the act of sowing and the significance of 'the word.' The verb 'σπείρει' (sows) indicates a deliberate action of planting the word, which is crucial for understanding the broader context of the parable of the sower.|
|MRK 4:15|And these are the ones along the path where the word is sown; when they hear, immediately Satan comes and takes away the word that was sown in their hearts.|In this verse, 'the way' represents those who are unprepared or distracted, leading to an inability to accept the word of God. The term 'devil' emphasizes the adversarial role of Satan in preventing belief. The translation aims to capture the immediacy of the action described, highlighting the urgency of spiritual attentiveness.|
|MRK 4:16|And these are the ones sown on rocky ground, who, when they hear the word, immediately receive it with joy;|The Greek term 'χαρᾶς' denotes a sense of joy and gladness, which is essential to understanding the reception of the word in this context. The reference to the 'rocky places' highlights the lack of depth in faith, while the immediate acceptance of joy signifies an initial enthusiasm that is not sustained due to shallow roots.|
|MRK 4:17|and they have no root within themselves, but are only temporary; then, when trouble or persecution arises because of the word, they immediately stumble.|This translation reflects the meaning of the original Greek text while maintaining clarity for modern readers. The emphasis is placed on the lack of deep-rootedness leading to an inability to endure challenges arising from their faith.|
|MRK 4:18|And these are the ones sown among thorns; they are the ones who hear the word.|This verse discusses the seed sown among thorns, which represents those who hear the word but are overwhelmed by worldly concerns. The imagery of thorns conveys the idea of choking and stifling growth. The use of the word 'hear' emphasizes the initial acceptance of the message, but also highlights the conflict with external pressures.|
|MRK 4:19|But the cares of this age, the deceitfulness of wealth, and the desires for other things enter in and suffocate the word, and it becomes unfruitful.|This verse emphasizes the detrimental effects of worldly distractions and desires on the spiritual growth of a believer. It uses terms that signify the concerns and deceit that can arise from the pursuit of material wealth and desires. The word 'suffocate' captures the idea of choking or hindering the growth of God's word in one's life.|
|MRK 4:20|And these are the ones sown on good soil: they hear the word, accept it, and produce fruit—thirtyfold, sixtyfold, and a hundredfold.|In this verse, the emphasis is on those who receive the word positively and allow it to take root, resulting in fruitfulness. The translation reflects the original Greek structure while ensuring clarity and flow in English. The numbers indicate different measures of spiritual fruitfulness, emphasizing abundance in spiritual growth.|
|MRK 4:21|And He said to them, "Is a lamp brought in to be put under a basket or under a bed? Is it not to be set on a stand?"|This verse uses the metaphor of a lamp to illustrate the purpose of light: to shine forth and provide illumination rather than to be hidden. The terms for 'lamp', 'basket', and 'stand' are significant in depicting the contrast between obscurity and visibility. The context emphasizes the revelation of truth through Christ's teachings.|
|MRK 4:22|For nothing is hidden that will not be revealed, nor has anything been kept secret but that it should come to light.|This verse emphasizes the inevitability of hidden truths being revealed. The language used here underscores a divine intention behind the unveiling of what is concealed. The contrast between hiddenness and revelation plays a significant role in understanding the nature of God's revelation in the world.|
|MRK 4:23|If anyone has ears to hear, let him listen.|This verse emphasizes the importance of attentiveness to Jesus' teachings. The phrase 'He who has ears to hear' is a call for active listening and understanding of spiritual truths. The word 'hear' (ἀκούειν) indicates not just auditory reception but a deeper comprehension and application of the message being conveyed.|
|MRK 4:24|And He said to them, "Take care what you listen to. With the measure you use, it will be measured to you, and even more will be added to you who hear."|This verse emphasizes the importance of how we receive and respond to the teachings of Jesus. The metaphor of measuring indicates that our engagement with His word will determine our spiritual gain. It reflects a principle of reciprocal understanding and wisdom gained from actively listening and applying God's teachings.|
|MRK 4:25|For whoever has, to him more will be given; and whoever does not have, even what he seems to have will be taken away.|This verse illustrates a principle of spiritual abundance and the consequences of neglect. The use of 'having' and 'not having' suggests a deeper truth about one's spiritual and moral state, and emphasizes that what we possess in understanding and grace is either cultivated or lost depending on our response to it.|
|MRK 4:26|And He said, "The kingdom of God is as if a man should scatter seed on the ground.|This verse illustrates the process of sowing seeds, paralleling the Kingdom of God’s growth with a farmer's act of planting. The focus is on the natural development that follows the initial act of sowing, highlighting the idea that the Kingdom of God unfolds organically, much like a seed planted in the ground.|
|MRK 4:27|And he sleeps and rises night and day, and the seed sprouts and grows; how, he does not know.|The verse captures the process of growth in the kingdom of God, emphasizing that while the farmer sleeps and rises, the seed grows without his direct knowledge or intervention. The use of ‘night and day’ signifies a continuous, natural process that reflects God's sovereign work in nature.|
|MRK 4:28|For the earth produces fruit by itself, first the blade, then the ear, and then the full grain in the ear.|The phrase 'αὐτομάτη' suggests an automatic or spontaneous process of growth, reflecting how nature operates without human intervention. The terms 'χόρτον' (grass), 'στάχυν' (head of grain), and 'πλήρη σῖτον' (full grain in the ear) signify different stages in the life cycle of grain, emphasizing the natural order of development from one stage to another.|
|MRK 4:29|But when the fruit is ready, immediately he sends out the sickle, because the harvest has come.|The phrase 'when the fruit is ripe' emphasizes the divine timing in agricultural processes, illustrating God's sovereignty in spiritual matters. The use of 'sends the sickle' corresponds to the act of harvesting, symbolizing the culmination of growth and the readiness for reaping what has been cultivated.|
|MRK 4:30|And He said, "With what can we compare the kingdom of God, or what parable shall we use to describe it?|In this verse, Jesus employs a rhetorical question to provoke thought regarding the nature of the Kingdom of God. The words chosen reflect the essence of comparison and metaphor which is characteristic of parabolic teaching. The structure maintains the original emphasis on understanding the kingdom through familiar analogies.|
|MRK 4:31|It is like a mustard seed, which when sown on the ground, is the smallest of all the seeds that are upon the earth.|The verse emphasizes the humble beginnings of the Kingdom of God, using the metaphor of a mustard seed, which is small but can grow into something significant. The use of 'sown' and 'earth' connects with agricultural imagery found throughout scripture.|
|MRK 4:32|But when it is sown, it rises and becomes greater than all the herbs, and it puts forth large branches, so that the birds of the sky may nest under its shade.|In this verse, the mustard seed metaphor is used to illustrate the growth of the kingdom of God from the smallest beginnings to something much greater. The emphasis on its growth and the shelter it provides connects to the theme of divine provision and care.|
|MRK 4:33|And with many such parables He spoke the word to them, as they were able to hear.|This verse highlights Jesus' method of teaching through parables, allowing listeners to grasp profound truths at their own level of understanding. The phrase 'as they were able to hear' indicates the accessibility of His teachings, tailored to the audience's comprehension.|
|MRK 4:34|Without a parable, He did not speak to them; but privately, to His own disciples, He explained everything.|This verse emphasizes the distinction in the way Jesus communicated with the crowds compared to His disciples, highlighting the use of parables in public teaching and private explanation. The term 'parables' reflects Jesus' method of imparting truth through relatable stories. 'Alone' or 'privately' indicates a personal, intimate instruction for His close followers, suggesting a deeper understanding granted to them.|
|MRK 4:35|And on that same day, when evening had come, He said to them, 'Let us go over to the other side.'|The phrase 'Let us cross over' emphasizes the intention of moving from one side to another, highlighting the disciples' participation in the journey.

The reference to 'other boats' implies that there were additional vessels following them, highlighting the popularity and influence of Jesus at that time.|

|MRK 4:40|And he said to them, 'Why are you so afraid? How is it that you have no faith?'|This verse emphasizes the themes of fear and faith, which are prevalent in the New Testament, particularly in the context of Jesus calming the storm.
