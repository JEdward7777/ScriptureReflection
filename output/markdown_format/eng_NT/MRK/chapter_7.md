| Reference | Verse | Translation Notes |
|:---------:|-------|-------------------|
|MRK 7:1|And the Pharisees and some of the scribes gathered to Him, having come from Jerusalem.|This verse introduces the confrontation between Jesus and the religious authorities, specifically the Pharisees and some scribes. The phrase 'they came together' reflects their collective action, which sets the stage for the ensuing dialogue about traditions and purity laws. It is essential to maintain the formal titles and the geographical context of Jerusalem to preserve the original intent.|
|MRK 7:2|And seeing some of His disciples eat with unclean hands, that is, unwashed, they found fault.|This verse highlights the cultural and ritual importance of handwashing among the Jewish people, particularly in the context of the Pharisees' strict adherence to traditions. The term 'common' (κοιναῖς) implies something that is considered ceremonially unclean, indicating the religious implications of the act of eating without washing.|
|MRK 7:3|For the Pharisees and all the Jews, unless they wash their hands in a ritual manner, do not eat, holding fast to the tradition of the elders.|This translation emphasizes the significance of hand washing as a tradition among the Pharisees and all Jews, linking it to the customs passed down from their elders. The word 'tradition' in this context refers specifically to religious customs that are upheld in contrast to the practices of Jesus and His disciples.|
|MRK 7:4|And when they return from the marketplace, they do not eat unless they have washed themselves. And there are many other traditions they observe, such as the washings of cups, pitchers, and kettles.|In this translation, I emphasize the ceremonial nature of the washing described, aligning with the context of traditions upheld by the Pharisees. The term for 'baptisms' is more accurately rendered as 'ceremonial washings' to convey the practice rather than the connotation of full immersion typically associated with baptism in the Christian sense.|
|MRK 7:5|Then the Pharisees and the scribes asked him, 'Why do your disciples not walk according to the tradition of the elders, but eat with unwashed hands?'|This verse highlights the Pharisees' emphasis on traditional rituals, specifically handwashing, in contrast to the practices of Jesus' disciples. The phrase 'the tradition of the elders' indicates a body of customs that the Pharisees considered authoritative, underlining their concern for ritual purity.|
|MRK 7:6|He replied, ‘Isaiah was right when he prophesied about you hypocrites; as it is written: ‘These people honor me with their lips, but their hearts are far away from me.’|In this verse, Jesus responds to the Pharisees by quoting Isaiah, highlighting the difference between outward ritual and genuine devotion. The term 'hypocrites' refers to those whose actions do not align with their professed beliefs, emphasizing the importance of sincerity in worship.|
|MRK 7:7|They worship me in vain; their teachings are but rules taught by men.|This verse emphasizes the futility of worship that is merely outward and does not stem from true reverence for God. The phrase 'in vain' conveys a sense of emptiness in their religious practices, as they prioritize human traditions over God's commandments.|
|MRK 7:8|For you leave behind the command of God and hold fast to the tradition of men, such as the ritual washings of cups and pots, and many other similar things you do.|This verse highlights the contrast between God's commandments and human traditions, indicating that adherence to the latter can lead to neglect of divine instructions. It emphasizes the futility of following human-made rules over God's commands, which is a central theme in the teachings of Jesus regarding true worship and obedience.|
|MRK 7:9|And He said to them, "You skillfully set aside the command of God in order to uphold your own tradition."|In this verse, Jesus addresses the Pharisees and scribes directly, highlighting the tension between God's commands and human traditions. The use of the term 'reject' here emphasizes a deliberate choice to set aside God's instructions in favor of established practices. The phrase 'to keep your tradition' illustrates the importance placed on human customs over divine mandates. This translation aims to maintain the original Greek emphasis and structure while being clear in contemporary English.|
|MRK 7:10|For Moses said, 'Honor your father and your mother'; and, 'Whoever speaks evil of father or mother must be put to death.'|In this verse, Jesus cites the commandment given by Moses regarding the honor due to parents, while also highlighting the severe consequence of cursing them. The translation maintains the emphasis on both the command to honor parents and the associated judgment for dishonoring them.|
|MRK 7:11|But you say, ‘If a man says to his father or mother, “Whatever I could have benefited you with is a gift to God,”’|In this verse, Jesus is addressing a specific practice among the Pharisees that allows people to neglect their obligations to their parents under the guise of dedicating funds to God. The term 'korban' (corban) is a Hebrew term meaning a gift or offering dedicated to God. The translation emphasizes the contrast between traditional obligations and the loopholes created by man-made traditions.|
|MRK 7:12|And you no longer allow him to do anything for his father or his mother.|This verse emphasizes the importance of honoring one's parents, contrasting the traditions of men that can lead to neglecting one's duties towards them. The wording has been chosen to maintain clarity and reflect the seriousness of the matter being addressed by Jesus.|
|MRK 7:13|Thus, you nullify the word of God by your tradition, which you have handed down; and you do many such things like this.|In this verse, Jesus emphasizes the conflict between God's word and human traditions. The term 'ἀκυροῦντες' (making void) is used to indicate how these traditions undermine divine authority. This translation retains the weight of the original Greek and captures the essence of the criticism directed towards the Pharisaic practices of the time.|
|MRK 7:14|And calling the crowd to Him, He said to them, "Listen to me, all of you, and understand this."|In this verse, Jesus is emphasizing the importance of listening and understanding His teachings. The call to 'hear' (ἀκούετέ) indicates an invitation to comprehend deeper truths, much like similar verses where the act of hearing is closely linked with understanding and receiving wisdom.|
|MRK 7:15|There is nothing outside a person that can make them unclean by going into them. Rather, it is what comes out of a person that makes them unclean.|In this verse, Jesus emphasizes that external factors cannot render a person unclean. Instead, it is the internal thoughts and intentions that define one’s purity or defilement. The focus shifts from ritualistic laws to moral and spiritual integrity.|
|MRK 7:17|And when He had entered the house away from the crowd, His disciples asked Him about the meaning of the parable.|In this verse, Jesus has just left a crowd and entered a house where His disciples question Him about a teaching. The focus is on the disciples’ desire to understand His words more clearly. The term 'parable' refers to His method of teaching through analogies or stories, which often require deeper contemplation for comprehension.|
|MRK 7:18|And He said to them, "Are you also so dull? Do you not perceive that whatever goes into a person from the outside cannot make them unclean?|In this verse, Jesus addresses the misunderstanding of His disciples regarding spiritual purity and external actions. He emphasizes that it is not what enters a person that defiles them but rather what comes from within.|
|MRK 7:19|For it does not enter into his heart, but into his belly, and is expelled into the latrine, thus declaring all foods clean.|In this verse, Jesus explains the nature of what truly makes a person unclean. The original Greek term for 'heart' (καρδίαν) refers to the inner moral and spiritual state of a person, while 'belly' (κοιλίαν) indicates the physical aspect of digestion. The mention of 'the toilet' (ἀφεδρῶνα) serves to emphasize that food is ultimately processed and expelled, thus highlighting that dietary practices do not define spiritual purity. The phrase 'cleansing all foods' suggests a theological shift in understanding what is acceptable to eat, reflecting the new covenant's focus on internal righteousness rather than external ritual cleanliness.|
|MRK 7:20|And He said, "What comes out of a person is what defiles them."|This translation aims to convey the emphasis on the source of defilement being internal rather than external, reflecting the core teaching of Jesus on purity and morality.|
|MRK 7:21|For from within, out of the heart of men, come evil thoughts: adultery, fornication, murders.|In this verse, the focus is on the source of evil actions, which emanate from the human heart rather than external circumstances. The use of the terms ‘evil thoughts’ reflects the original Greek meaning of ‘διαλογισμοί’, while the listed immoral actions underscore the serious nature of these inner struggles.|
|MRK 7:22|Theft, greed, wickedness, deceit, sensuality, an evil eye, slander, pride, and foolishness; all these evil things come from within and defile a person.|This verse reflects the moral failings that stem from within a person's heart, emphasizing the internal origin of sinful actions. Each word captures a specific form of moral corruption or vice that corrupts the soul and leads to sinful behavior. The choice of words aims to highlight the gravity of these offenses in a direct manner.|
|MRK 7:23|All these wicked things come from within and corrupt a person.|This translation emphasizes the internal source of evil, paralleling the context of the previous verse and the importance of the heart in moral actions. The word 'defile' indicates how these evil thoughts and actions affect a person's moral purity.|
|MRK 7:24|And from there He arose and went to the region of Tyre and Sidon. He entered a house and did not want anyone to know it; yet He could not escape notice.|In this verse, the use of 'withdrew' and 'desired' helps to convey Jesus's intention to seek privacy while indicating the emphasis on His purpose and urgency. The phrase 'did not want anyone to know' suggests a deliberate attempt to avoid public attention, which reflects the theme of the Messiah’s ministry often being misunderstood or misrepresented.|
|MRK 7:25|For a woman whose young daughter had an unclean spirit heard of Him and came and fell at His feet.|In this translation, I focused on the emotional depth and the urgency of the woman's situation, reflecting her desperation as she seeks help for her daughter afflicted by an unclean spirit. The structure maintains the original meaning while being accessible in contemporary English.|
|MRK 7:26|Now the woman was a Greek, a Syrophoenician by birth, and she begged Him to cast the demon out of her daughter.|In this verse, the woman's identity as a Greek and specifically a Syrophoenician emphasizes her status as a Gentile seeking help from Jesus. The phrase ‘to cast out’ reflects the urgency and desperation of her request regarding her daughter's condition.|
|MRK 7:27|But Jesus said to her, "Let the children be filled first, for it is not good to take the children's bread and throw it to the dogs."|In this verse, Jesus emphasizes the priority of His mission to the children of Israel, likening them to children who must be fed before the 'dogs,' a term used here to refer to non-Jews or Gentiles. The imagery of bread illustrates the spiritual sustenance that Jesus offers, reflecting His ministry's focus. It is essential to capture the nuance of His statement regarding priority and inclusion.|
|MRK 7:28|But she answered and said to Him, 'Yes, Lord, yet the little dogs under the table eat from the children’s crumbs.'|In this verse, the woman acknowledges her place and expresses humility in her request for Jesus' help, using the metaphor of dogs eating crumbs. The term 'dogs' here is often interpreted as a reference to the Gentiles, but she uses it with a sense of persistence and understanding of the hierarchy Jesus mentions.|
|MRK 7:29|And He said to her, 'For this saying, go your way; the demon has gone out of your daughter.'|In this verse, the phrase 'through this word' emphasizes the power and authority of Jesus' declaration. The term 'the demon' refers to the evil spirit affecting the girl, highlighting the significance of Jesus' ability to command the spiritual realm. The context shows the faith of the mother and the immediacy of the healing that follows His command.|
|MRK 7:30|And when she had returned to her home, she found her child lying on the bed, and the demon had departed.|This verse recounts the immediate outcome of the woman's plea to Jesus regarding her daughter. The terms used here emphasize the condition of the child and the significant act of deliverance from demonic possession.|
|MRK 7:31|Then Jesus went out again from the borders of Tyre and Sidon and came to the Sea of Galilee, through the midst of the region of the Decapolis.|In this verse, the reference to Jesus moving from the region of Tyre and Sidon back to the Sea of Galilee highlights His continuous ministry in different regions, emphasizing the spread of His fame and miracles. The mention of Decapolis indicates a primarily Gentile area, further illustrating the outreach of Jesus' ministry.|
|MRK 7:32|And they brought to Him a deaf man who had difficulty speaking, and they pleaded with Him to lay His hand on him.|In this verse, 'κωφὸν' translates to 'deaf', while 'μογιλάλον' conveys the idea of being mute or unable to speak properly. The phrase 'παρακαλοῦσιν' implies a request or appeal made by the crowd. The translation aims to capture the urgency and expectation of the people as they bring the deaf-mute to Jesus, emphasizing the act of seeking His healing touch.|
|MRK 7:33|And taking him aside from the crowd, He put His fingers into his ears, and after spitting, He touched his tongue.|This verse depicts a unique interaction between Jesus and the deaf man, emphasizing the physicality of the healing process. The act of putting His fingers into the man's ears and touching his tongue signifies a direct engagement with the man’s disabilities, highlighting Jesus' compassionate and personal approach to healing.|
|MRK 7:34|And looking up to heaven, He sighed deeply and said to him, 'Be opened!'|The term 'ἐφφαθά' translates directly to 'Be opened!' in English, conveying a sense of command to enable understanding or ability. The use of 'eyes' and 'ears' in the context refers to both physical and spiritual insight, connecting to other verses where healing or enlightenment occurs.|
|MRK 7:35|And immediately his ears were opened, and the bond of his tongue was loosened, and he spoke plainly.|The phrase 'his ears were opened' implies a miraculous healing and restoration of the ability to hear, which is a recurrent theme in Jesus’ miracles. The term 'loosed' regarding his tongue indicates a release from a condition that hindered his speech, enabling him to speak clearly.|
|MRK 7:36|And he sternly commanded them not to tell anyone. But the more he insisted, the more they proclaimed it.|In this verse, the command given by Jesus to keep silent emphasizes the motif of secrecy surrounding his miracles. The phrase 'he sternly ordered them' reflects the strong and direct manner in which Jesus instructed the witnesses. The contrasting action of them proclaiming even more signifies the irresistible nature of the miracle and the message of Jesus that could not be contained.|
|MRK 7:37|And they were utterly astonished, saying, 'He has done all things well. He even makes the deaf hear and the mute speak.'|In this translation, I sought to capture the amazement of the crowd and the acknowledgment of Jesus’ miraculous works. The terms used reflect a direct admiration of Jesus' abilities to heal and transform lives, emphasizing both the completeness and the effectiveness of his miracles.|
