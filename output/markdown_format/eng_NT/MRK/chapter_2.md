|MRK 2:6|But there were some of the scribes sitting there and reasoning in their hearts.|This verse illustrates the inner thoughts and reasoning of the scribes, emphasizing their critical attitude towards Jesus. The term 'reasoning' (διαλογιζόμενοι) suggests a deeper contemplation or deliberation, highlighting the contrast between their thoughts and Jesus' authority. The use of 'hearts' (καρδίαις) symbolizes their true intentions and beliefs, which are crucial in understanding their response to Jesus' actions.|
|MRK 2:7|Why does this man speak blasphemies like this? Who can forgive sins but God alone?|This verse highlights the skepticism of the scribes regarding Jesus' authority to forgive sins, which is viewed as a divine prerogative. The language used reflects their incredulity and frames the theological discussion about Jesus' identity and authority in contrast to God's.|
|MRK 2:8|And immediately Jesus, perceiving in His spirit that they were reasoning this way within themselves, said to them, "Why are you pondering these things in your hearts?"|In this translation, the phrase 'knowing in His spirit' reflects the divine understanding of Jesus regarding the thoughts of those present. The term 'heart' represents the inner thoughts and intentions, which aligns with the understanding in both the Old and New Testament about the nature of human contemplation and intent.|
|MRK 2:9|Which is easier to say to the paralytic: ‘Your sins are forgiven,’ or to say, ‘Get up, take your mat, and walk’?|This verse contrasts the forgiveness of sins with the act of physical healing, highlighting the authority of Jesus in both spiritual and physical realms. The phrasing is intended to provoke thought about the nature of authority and the perception of what is 'easy' versus 'hard' to accomplish, especially in a religious context.|
|MRK 2:10|But so you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins—He then spoke to the paralytic.|In this verse, the emphasis is on the authority of the Son of Man (Jesus) to forgive sins, which is a profound declaration of His divine power and role as the mediator between God and humanity. The translation captures this key aspect while using accessible language.|
|MRK 2:11|I tell you, arise, take up your bed, and go home.|This verse emphasizes Jesus' command to the paralytic, showcasing both His authority and the call to action.

The term 'crowd' is consistent with the overwhelming interest and need for spiritual teaching, highlighting the magnetic effect of Jesus' ministry.|
|MRK 2:14|And passing by, He saw Levi the son of Alphaeus sitting at the tax booth, and He said to him, "Follow me." And rising up, he followed Him.|In this translation, the emphasis is on the act of following Jesus, which indicates a commitment and a life-changing decision. The reference to Levi being at the tax booth suggests his role and social status, while the phrase 'follow me' serves as a direct invitation that highlights the authority of Jesus and the transformative nature of His call.|
|MRK 2:15|And it happened that as He was reclining at the table in His house, many tax collectors and sinners were dining with Jesus and His disciples; for there were many, and they followed Him.|The term 'reclining' is used in a cultural context referring to the common practice during meals in ancient Jewish tradition where individuals would recline on couches rather than sit at a table. The inclusion of 'sinners' and 'tax collectors' reflects the societal view of these groups at the time as outcasts. The verse emphasizes Jesus' mission to reach out to those marginalized by society.|
|MRK 2:16|And when the scribes of the Pharisees saw Him eating with the tax collectors and sinners, they said to His disciples, 'Why does He eat and drink with tax collectors and sinners?'|This verse highlights the critical attitude of the scribes and Pharisees toward Jesus' association with tax collectors and sinners. The terms 'eat' and 'drink' are used to denote the fellowship and acceptance extended by Jesus to those considered socially outcast, which was controversial to the religious leaders of the time. The phrase 'tax collectors and sinners' is a common label used to describe individuals who were marginalized and viewed with disdain by the religious elite, thus illustrating the radical nature of Jesus' ministry.|
|MRK 2:17|And hearing this, Jesus said to them, "It is not the healthy who need a physician, but those who are sick. I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance."|In this verse, Jesus emphasizes His mission to call those in need of spiritual healing, contrasting their state with that of the righteous. The choice of words highlights His purpose and the necessity of repentance for those who are spiritually unwell.|
|MRK 2:18|Now the disciples of John and the Pharisees were fasting. And they came and said to Him, "Why do the disciples of John and the Pharisees fast, but Your disciples do not fast?"|In this verse, the question revolves around the practice of fasting and the contrasting behavior of Jesus' disciples compared to those of John the Baptist and the Pharisees. The focus is on the perception of righteousness and piety associated with fasting, and the implications of joy and celebration in the presence of Jesus, who embodies the fulfillment of the Law.|
|MRK 2:19|And Jesus said to them, "Can the sons of the bridechamber fast while the bridegroom is with them? As long as they have the bridegroom with them, they cannot fast."|In this verse, Jesus uses the imagery of a wedding to illustrate the joyous presence of the bridegroom, emphasizing that fasting is inappropriate during a time of celebration. The word 'νυμφίος' (bridegroom) is significant as it denotes a close and joyful relationship, paralleling the disciples' relationship with Jesus.|
|MRK 2:20|But the days will come when the bridegroom is taken away from them, and then they will fast in those days.|In this verse, the term 'bridegroom' symbolizes Jesus, while 'days' signifies the future time when He will be gone, marking the occasion for fasting. The phrasing captures the anticipation of sorrow and longing that accompanies His absence, resonating with the theme of fasting in mourning or seeking God’s presence.|
|MRK 2:21|No one sews a patch of unshrunk cloth on an old garment; otherwise, the new patch will pull away from the old, and a worse tear will result.|This verse emphasizes the incompatibility of the old and the new. Just as one cannot combine old clothing with new fabric without causing damage, so too are the teachings of Christ incompatible with the old Jewish customs and practices. The imagery of tearing is used to highlight the division that occurs when trying to blend these two distinct ways of understanding faith and life.|
|MRK 2:22|And no one puts new wine into old wineskins; otherwise, the new wine will burst the skins, and the wine will spill out and the skins will be destroyed. But new wine must be put into fresh wineskins.|In this verse, Jesus uses the metaphor of new wine and old wineskins to illustrate the incompatibility between His teachings and the existing traditions of the religious leaders. The phrase 'new wine' symbolizes the new covenant He brings, while 'old wineskins' represent the outdated practices and beliefs that cannot contain the transformative message of the Gospel. The fresh translation aims to capture the essence of this metaphor while maintaining clarity and readability for contemporary audiences.|
|MRK 2:23|One Sabbath, He was passing through the grain fields, and His disciples began to pluck the heads of grain as they went along.|This translation emphasizes the actions of the disciples as they walk through the grain fields, focusing on the significance of their actions within the context of Sabbath observance. The verb 'to pluck' is used to convey their action more vividly, aligning with the notion of labor associated with harvesting, which is central to the discussion of Sabbath law.|
|MRK 2:24|And the Pharisees said to Him, "Look, why are they doing what is not lawful on the Sabbath?"|In this verse, the Pharisees confront Jesus about the actions of His disciples, highlighting their interpretation of the Sabbath laws. The wording aims to maintain the original Greek's focus on what they perceive as a violation of the Sabbath by emphasizing the phrase ‘what is not lawful.’ The translation seeks to preserve the intent of the Pharisees’ challenge to Jesus, making it clear that their focus is on the legality of the actions taken by the disciples.|
|MRK 2:25|And He answered them, "Have you never read what David did when he had a need and was hungry, he and those who were with him?|In this verse, Jesus references an important historical event in the life of David to illustrate a principle about human need and the interpretation of the law. The word 'need' emphasizes a legitimate requirement that overrides strict legalism, while 'hungry' conveys the physical state prompting this discussion. The use of the term 'with him' stresses the communal aspect of David's experience, highlighting that both he and his companions faced the same need.|
|MRK 2:26|How he entered the house of God in the time of Abiathar the high priest and ate the consecrated bread, which is not lawful for anyone to eat except for the priests, and he also gave it to those who were with him.|This verse references the act of David entering the house of God during a time of need, highlighting the distinction between sacred and everyday practices. It emphasizes mercy over ritual law, demonstrating the Lord's understanding of human necessity.|
|MRK 2:27|And he said to them, 'The Sabbath was made for the benefit of man, not man for the Sabbath.'|This verse emphasizes the purpose of the Sabbath in relation to humanity rather than the reverse, illustrating God's intention for rest and well-being for mankind. It reflects a significant teaching about the nature of religious observance in the context of human need.|
|MRK 2:28|Thus, the Son of Man is Lord even of the Sabbath.|This translation emphasizes the authority of Jesus as the 'Son of Man' over the Sabbath. The structure reflects the original Greek while providing clarity in English. 'Lord' signifies not only authority but also a personal relationship with the concept of the Sabbath, aligning with the broader theological implications found in the Gospels.|
