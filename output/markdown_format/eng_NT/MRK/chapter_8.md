| Reference | Verse | Translation Notes |
|:---------:|-------|-------------------|
|MRK 8:1|In those days, when there was again a great crowd with nothing to eat, Jesus called His disciples to Him and said to them:|This verse emphasizes Jesus’ concern for the physical needs of the crowd, similar to themes found in other Gospel accounts. The use of 'crowd' and 'having nothing to eat' indicates the urgency of the situation.|
|MRK 8:2|I have compassion on the crowd, because they have been with Me now for three days and have nothing to eat.|The term 'σπλαγχνίζομαι' denotes a deep, visceral compassion that moves one to act on behalf of others in need. In this context, it highlights Jesus' awareness of the physical needs of the crowd and His desire to respond to their plight after three days of waiting for Him without food.|
|MRK 8:3|And if I send them away hungry to their homes, they will faint along the way; for some of them have come from far.|In this verse, Jesus expresses concern for the crowd's physical well-being, emphasizing that sending them home hungry would lead to their physical weakness and distress. The use of 'if I send them away hungry' indicates a direct concern for their state, while 'some of them have come from a distance' highlights the hardship of their journey and the necessity of providing for them before they leave.|
|MRK 8:4|His disciples answered Him, "How can anyone satisfy these people with bread here in this wilderness?"|This verse captures the disciples' doubt about the ability to feed the people in a desolate place. The words used convey a sense of urgency and concern regarding provision in a remote area. The reference to 'wilderness' emphasizes the scarcity and challenges faced.|
|MRK 8:5|And He asked them, "How many loaves do you have?" They replied, "Seven."|This verse illustrates the dialogue between Jesus and His disciples regarding the amount of bread available, emphasizing their limited resources in the face of a large crowd. The wording is structured to reflect the inquiry of Jesus and the response of the disciples clearly and simply.|
|MRK 8:6|So He instructed the crowd to sit down on the ground. Taking the seven loaves, He gave thanks, broke them, and gave them to His disciples to set before the people. And they distributed them to the crowd.|In this verse, the actions of Jesus—commanding the crowd to sit down, taking the bread, giving thanks, breaking the bread, and distributing it—are all central to the miracle of feeding the thousands. The translation aims to convey the sequence of events clearly, maintaining the tone of reverence associated with Jesus' actions. The words 'commanded,' 'taking,' 'giving thanks,' 'broke,' and 'distributed' reflect the original Greek closely, ensuring a faithful representation of the text.|
|MRK 8:7|They also had a few small fish; and after He had blessed them, He told them to set these before the people.|In this verse, the emphasis is on the act of blessing the fish and instructing His disciples to serve them, which parallels the previous verses regarding the loaves. The term 'blessing' reflects the typical Jewish custom of offering thanks before a meal. The term 'fish' is translated directly as 'small fish' to denote the specific type of fish referenced in the original Greek, emphasizing the humble nature of the meal being provided.|
|MRK 8:8|They ate and were satisfied; and they gathered up the leftover pieces, seven baskets full.|In this verse, the Greek words 'ἔφαγον' (they ate) and 'ἐχορτάσθησαν' (they were satisfied) are central, emphasizing the miraculous provision of food. The mention of 'περισσεύματα' (leftovers) and 'κλασμάτων' (broken pieces) underscores the abundance of God's provision. The number seven, 'ἑπτὰ,' symbolizes completeness in biblical literature, which can imply that God's provision is perfect and sufficient for His people.|
|MRK 8:9|Now there were about four thousand people; and He sent them away.|The phrase 'four thousand' (τετρακισχίλιοι) is a specific count that emphasizes the number of people fed. The word 'dismissed' (ἀπέλυσεν) suggests a compassionate sending away after providing for their needs. This contrasts with the feeding of the five thousand, emphasizing Christ's continuing ministry and provision.|
|MRK 8:10|And immediately He got into the boat with His disciples and came to the region of Dalmanutha.|In this verse, the use of 'immediately' suggests a sense of urgency and action taken by Jesus, which is consistent with the overall narrative of His ministry. The term 'into the boat' signifies a departure from the crowd, emphasizing the transition to a different locale, here specifically noted as 'the regions of Dalmanutha.'|
|MRK 8:11|Then the Pharisees came out and began to argue with Him, seeking from Him a sign from heaven, testing Him.|The verse reflects the ongoing conflict between Jesus and the Pharisees, emphasizing their demand for a miraculous sign while also revealing their intent to challenge Him. The word 'sign' (σημεῖον) carries connotations of proof or verification of authority, significant in the context of Jesus' ministry.|
|MRK 8:12|And sighing deeply in His spirit, He said, 'Why does this generation seek a sign? Truly, I say to you, no sign shall be given to this generation.'|In this verse, Jesus expresses exasperation towards the generation that demands a sign, indicating their lack of faith. The phrase 'this generation' conveys a sense of judgment and finality regarding their request. The emphasis on the term 'sign' relates to divine validation of His authority and mission, contrasting the expectations of the religious leaders with the true revelation He provides.|
|MRK 8:13|And having left them, He went back into the boat again.|In this verse, the action of leaving indicates Jesus' intention to move on after addressing the crowd's demands for a sign. The phrase 'He left them' emphasizes a moment of departure both physically and metaphorically, marking a transition in His ministry. The verb 'ἀφεὶς' (aphies) is used in a way that suggests a deliberate decision to disengage from the current situation, further underscoring His purpose in ministry to focus on His disciples rather than the demands of the crowd.|
|MRK 8:14|And they had forgotten to bring bread; and they had only one loaf with them in the boat.|This verse captures the disciples' forgetfulness regarding their provisions, which is central to the narrative of Jesus teaching about faith and reliance on God. The emphasis on 'one loaf' highlights their lack of resources and understanding of Jesus' miraculous abilities. The phrase 'in the boat' indicates their immediate context and surroundings, which is crucial for understanding the scene.|
|MRK 8:15|And he warned them, saying, "Take heed; beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and the leaven of Herod."|In this verse, the term 'leaven' symbolizes an influence or doctrine that can corrupt or permeate an individual or community. Here, it is specifically directed against the teachings and practices of the Pharisees and Herod, highlighting a caution against their insidious influence. The use of 'leaven' is metaphorical, as in other New Testament passages, illustrating the pervasive nature of false teachings.|
|MRK 8:16|And they began to discuss among themselves, saying, "We have no bread."|The phrase 'they reasoned among themselves' captures the inner dialogue of the disciples, reflecting confusion and concern over a lack of bread. The Greek word 'διελογίζοντο' conveys a sense of discussion or debate. In the context of Jesus' warning about leaven, their conversation reveals a misunderstanding of the deeper spiritual significance of His words, as they focus solely on their physical need.|
|MRK 8:17|And Jesus, perceiving this, said to them, "Why are you reasoning about having no bread? Do you not yet perceive or understand? Is your heart still hardened?|In this verse, Jesus challenges His disciples' lack of understanding regarding His miraculous provision. The terms for understanding and heart signify deeper spiritual perception and the hardness that can hinder faith.|
|MRK 8:18|Having eyes, do you not see? And having ears, do you not hear? And do you not remember?|This verse emphasizes the spiritual blindness and deafness of the people despite having physical senses. The rhetorical questions challenge the audience's perception and memory regarding the miracles they have witnessed. The structure mirrors similar statements in the Old Testament that point to a recurring theme of spiritual incomprehension among God's people.|
|MRK 8:19|When I broke the five loaves for the five thousand, how many baskets full of pieces did you take up? They said to Him, "Twelve."|In this verse, the use of the word 'loaves' is consistent with the terminology of feeding miracles in the Gospels. The numbers mentioned relate to the specific context of the miracle of feeding the multitudes. The choice of 'baskets' reflects the common understanding of how food was collected and distributed during that time, emphasizing the miracle of abundance from scarcity.|
|MRK 8:20|And when I broke the seven loaves for the four thousand, how many baskets full of leftover pieces did you gather? They said to Him, "Seven."|This verse captures the moment of Jesus referencing the feeding of the four thousand, focusing on the disciples' response about the seven baskets of leftover pieces. The use of the term 'pieces' here highlights the abundance resulting from His miraculous provision, drawing a parallel to the previous miracle of feeding the five thousand.|
|MRK 8:21|And He said to them, 'Do you not yet comprehend?'|In this verse, Jesus questions the disciples' understanding. The original Greek word 'συνίετε' indicates a failure to grasp spiritual truths. The emphasis is on their lack of perception regarding the miracles and teachings they have witnessed.|
|MRK 8:22|And He came to Bethsaida, and they brought a blind man to Him, and begged Him to touch him.|In this verse, the action of bringing the blind man to Jesus signifies faith and the desire for healing. The phrase 'to touch' (ἅψηται) indicates a personal interaction that reflects the belief in Jesus’ healing power. The choice of the word 'sight' captures the physical and spiritual restoration.|
|MRK 8:23|And taking the blind man by the hand, He led him out of the village; and after spitting on his eyes and laying His hands on him, He asked him, "Do you see anything?"|This verse illustrates the physical healing Jesus performed, showcasing both His compassion and power. The act of spitting and laying hands is significant, as it demonstrates His intimate involvement in the healing process. The phrase 'What do you see?' reflects a deeper spiritual inquiry into the man's understanding and faith.|
|MRK 8:24|And when he looked up, he said, "I see people, like trees walking about."|In this translation, I focused on conveying the imagery of sight and clarity in the context of spiritual awakening and physical healing. The phrase 'like trees walking' reflects the man's initial perception and hints at the progressive nature of his healing.|
|MRK 8:25|Then he put his hands again on the man's eyes, and this time he was able to see clearly; his sight was completely restored, and he looked around and saw everything distinctly.|The original text uses terms that reflect physical restoration and clarity of vision. The act of placing hands upon the eyes signifies a personal and intimate healing touch, while 'seeing clearly' indicates complete restoration of sight. The translation aims to capture the miracle's profound impact and clarity achieved.|
|MRK 8:26|And He sent him home, saying, 'Do not enter the village, nor tell anyone there about what has happened.'|In this verse, the emphasis is on the directive given to the man regarding his actions following his healing. The terms used for 'house' and 'village' are significant as they relate to the community and the personal context of the man's life after the miracle. The instruction to keep silent adds a layer of meaning to the event of healing, highlighting Jesus' desire for discretion.|
|MRK 8:27|Jesus went out with his disciples to the villages of Caesarea Philippi. Along the way, He asked His disciples, "Who do people say that I am?"|This verse sets the stage for Jesus' revelation of His identity, showing the different opinions people hold about Him. The use of 'ἄνθρωποι' (people) emphasizes the general view, while 'μαθηταὶ' (disciples) indicates a more intimate inquiry into Jesus' identity among those who follow Him.|
|MRK 8:28|And they answered, "John the Baptist; and others say Elijah; and still others, one of the prophets."|The response from the people reflects a range of beliefs about Jesus' identity, drawing on significant figures from Jewish history like John the Baptist and Elijah, indicating their recognition of His prophetic role.|
|MRK 8:29|And He asked them, "But who do you say that I am?" Peter answered and said to Him, "You are the Christ."|In this fresh translation, the emphasis is placed on the identity of Jesus as recognized by Peter, reflecting the Greek construction that emphasizes the personal confession of faith. The use of the term 'Christ' is crucial, indicating the anointed one or Messiah as understood in the Jewish context.|
|MRK 8:30|And He strictly commanded them not to speak to anyone about Him.|In this verse, Jesus emphasizes the importance of keeping His identity as the Messiah secret for the time being. This directive serves to guide the disciples in their understanding of His mission and the timing of His revelation to the public. The use of 'commanded' indicates the seriousness of His instruction, while 'to no one' underscores the exclusivity of His identity at this moment.|
|MRK 8:31|And He began to teach them that the Son of Man must suffer many things, and be rejected by the elders, the chief priests, and the scribes, and be killed, and after three days rise again.|This verse emphasizes the inevitability of suffering that Jesus, referred to as the 'Son of Man,' must face. The use of 'must' (δεῖ) highlights a divine necessity rather than a mere possibility. The terms 'elders', 'chief priests', and 'scribes' refer to the Jewish leadership who would play a significant role in His rejection and death, showcasing the fulfillment of prophetic suffering. The mention of resurrection on the third day serves as a critical point of hope following the foretelling of His passion.|
|MRK 8:32|And He spoke openly about this. But Peter took Him aside and began to rebuke Him.|This verse captures the moment when Peter responds to Jesus' foretelling of His suffering. The term 'rebuke' (ἐπιτιμᾶν) is significant, showing Peter's strong opposition to Jesus' predictions, reflecting the common misunderstanding of the Messiah's role during that period.|
|MRK 8:33|But turning around and seeing His disciples, He rebuked Peter, saying, "Get behind Me, Satan! For you are not setting your mind on the things of God, but on the things of men."|In this verse, Jesus rebukes Peter by equating his thoughts with those of Satan, emphasizing the stark contrast between divine and human reasoning. The term 'Satan' serves as a metaphor for opposition to God’s plans. This translation maintains the directness and authority of Jesus’ response.|
|MRK 8:34|And summoning the crowd with His disciples, He said to them, "Whoever wishes to follow Me must deny himself, take up his cross, and follow Me."|In this verse, Jesus emphasizes the importance of self-denial and the readiness to embrace suffering for the sake of following Him. The concept of taking up one's cross signifies the willingness to endure hardship and challenges in the journey of discipleship. This translation maintains the original Greek intent while using contemporary language for clarity.|
|MRK 8:35|For whoever desires to save his own life will lose it; but whoever loses his life for My sake and for the sake of the Gospel will save it.|This verse emphasizes the paradox of life in Christ—true life is found in self-sacrifice for the sake of Jesus and the Gospel. The term 'soul' (ψυχὴ) in this context refers to one's essence or life force, illustrating the tension between self-preservation and the call to follow Christ.|
|MRK 8:36|For what does it benefit a person if he gains the whole world but forfeits his soul?|In this translation, the essence of the verse is captured by emphasizing the futility of gaining worldly success at the expense of one’s eternal well-being. The term 'soul' is retained to highlight its significance in contrast to the material world.|
|MRK 8:37|Or what will a man give in exchange for his soul?|This verse asks a rhetorical question, emphasizing the inestimable value of the soul compared to material possessions. The original Greek phrase 'ἀντάλλαγμα τῆς ψυχῆς' suggests a notion of exchange, indicating that there is no equivalent exchange for the soul.|
|MRK 8:38|For whoever is ashamed of me and my words in this adulterous and sinful generation, of him the Son of Man will be ashamed when he comes in the glory of his Father with the holy angels.|This verse emphasizes the importance of not being ashamed of Jesus and His teachings, especially in the context of a sinful and adulterous generation. The term 'ashamed' suggests a sense of disgrace or dishonor, and the text reflects the seriousness of the consequences for such shame. The use of 'Son of Man' connects to Jesus' humanity and His authority to judge.|
