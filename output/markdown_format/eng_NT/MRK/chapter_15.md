The phrase 'having bound Jesus' suggests both a physical and symbolic binding as they take him into custody. The word 'delivered' here denotes the transfer of responsibility for Jesus to Pilate, highlighting the collaboration between the Jewish leaders and the Roman authority in the condemnation of Jesus.|
|MRK 15:2|And Pilate asked Him, 'Are You the King of the Jews?' Jesus replied, 'You say so.'|In this verse, the dialogue between Pilate and Jesus is succinct yet profound. Pilate's question is straightforward, seeking to clarify Jesus' identity as the King of the Jews. Jesus' response, 'You say so,' is a confirmation that reflects His understanding of the implications of His kingship. This exchange illustrates the tension between earthly authority and divine truth.|
|MRK 15:3|And the chief priests brought many accusations against Him, but He answered nothing.|The verse highlights Jesus' silence in the face of accusations from the high priests, which reflects His fulfillment of prophetic scripture about the Messiah's demeanor during trials. The phrase 'the chief priests' indicates the authoritative religious leaders of the time, while the word 'accused' underscores the formal charge against Him. The use of 'many' signifies a multitude of accusations without specific detail.|
|MRK 15:4|Then Pilate again asked Him, saying, 'Are You not going to answer? Look at how many charges they are bringing against You!'|This verse reflects the moment when Pilate, the Roman governor, presses Jesus for a response amidst accusations brought against Him. The repetition of questioning suggests Pilate's confusion or frustration at Jesus’ silence in the face of many testimonies. The usage of 'testifying' links to the act of bringing accusations, creating a theme of injustice in this judicial setting.|
|MRK 15:5|But Jesus made no further reply, so that Pilate was amazed.|This verse reflects the silence of Jesus before Pilate, emphasizing His composure amidst accusations, akin to the prophecies in Isaiah regarding the suffering servant. The verb 'ἀπεκρίθη' (did not answer) highlights His intentional silence, reinforcing the theme of innocence and fulfillment of scripture.|
|MRK 15:6|Now at the festival, it was customary for him to release one prisoner to them, whoever they requested.|This verse highlights the custom of releasing a prisoner during the festival, reflecting a practice of clemency associated with significant Jewish feasts. The choice of words conveys the legal and cultural norms of that period.|

'Αἰτεῖσθαι' signifies a plea or request, highlighting the fervor with which they are asking for Barabbas.|
|MRK 15:9|But Pilate answered them, saying, "Do you want me to release to you the King of the Jews?"|In this verse, Pilate addresses the crowd directly, highlighting the authority he holds in the decision-making process regarding the release of a prisoner. The phrase 'King of the Jews' emphasizes Jesus' identity and the paradox of the crowd's desire to free a criminal instead of Him. The question posed by Pilate also implies a choice between authority and the people’s will.|
|MRK 15:10|For he perceived that it was out of envy that the chief priests had handed him over.|The word 'φθόνος' translates to 'envy' or 'jealousy,' indicating the motive behind the actions of the chief priests. The term 'ἀρχιερεῖς' refers to the chief priests, a key group involved in the trial of Jesus. This verse highlights the underlying emotional motivations that influenced the judicial decisions against Jesus, reflecting on how personal feelings can impact justice.|
|MRK 15:11|But the chief priests stirred up the crowd to demand that he release Barabbas to them.|The phrase 'to release' in the original Greek (ἀπολύσῃ) carries connotations of setting free or liberating, which is reflected in the choice of the word in this translation. Additionally, the term 'crowd' refers to a gathering of people who are influenced by the religious leaders, which is crucial to understanding the dynamics of this moment.|
|MRK 15:12|So Pilate answered again and said to them, "What then do you want me to do with Him whom you call the King of the Jews?"|In this translation, I aim to convey Pilate's inquiry to the crowd regarding their preference between Jesus, whom he refers to as 'the King of the Jews', and Barabbas.

The use of 'crucify Him' in the response highlights the intense and hostile reaction of the people, revealing their rejection of the truth and justice.|

The choice of releasing Barabbas instead of Jesus highlights the crowd's preference for a known criminal over the innocent Jesus. The phrase 'to satisfy the crowd' reflects Pilate's political maneuvering amidst public pressure.|

|MRK 15:17|And they dressed Him in a purple robe, and weaving together a crown of thorns, they placed it on Him.|In this verse, the soldiers dress Jesus in purple, symbolizing royalty, and crown Him with thorns, which serves to mock His claim to kingship.

|MRK 15:18|And they began to salute Him, saying, 'Hail, King of the Jews!'|The phrase 'Hail, King of the Jews' is a mocking greeting directed at Jesus by the soldiers.

|MRK 15:20|And when they had mocked Him, they stripped Him of the purple robe and clothed Him in His own garments. Then they led Him out to crucify Him.|This verse depicts the humiliation and mockery that Jesus endured at the hands of the soldiers. The term 'stripped' indicates not only a physical act but also serves to emphasize the indignity and shame He faced.

The mention of Simon's sons, Alexander and Rufus, may indicate their significance to the early Christian community, possibly as known figures among the followers of Christ.|
|MRK 15:22|And they brought Him to the place called Golgotha, which is translated, 'Place of the Skull.'|The term 'Golgotha' is derived from Aramaic and means 'skull,' indicative of the location's appearance or significance. In this verse, it is essential to highlight both the act of carrying Jesus to this site and the understanding of its name, linking the physical journey with the spiritual implications of the crucifixion.|
|MRK 15:23|And they offered Him wine mixed with myrrh; but He did not take it.|This verse illustrates the cruelty and mockery Jesus faced as He was crucified, offering Him a drink that symbolized suffering rather than relief.

|MRK 15:25|It was the third hour when they crucified Him.|The phrase 'it was the third hour' indicates the time of day according to Jewish timekeeping, which began at sunrise.

|MRK 15:27|And they crucified two robbers with Him, one on His right and one on His left.|This verse highlights the act of crucifixion alongside two criminals, emphasizing Jesus' association with wrongdoers, which is a recurring theme in the Gospels. The mention of positions, one on the right and one on the left, is significant for its symbolism and fulfillment of prophecies regarding the Messiah being 'numbered with the transgressors.'|
|MRK 15:28|And the scripture was fulfilled that says: ‘He was counted among the lawless.’|This verse highlights the fulfillment of prophecy concerning the Messiah being associated with lawbreakers.

It highlights the misunderstanding of His mission and the sacrificial nature of His death on the cross.|

|MRK 15:38|And the curtain of the temple was torn in two from the top down to the bottom.|The term 'curtain' refers to the veil of the temple that separated the Holy Place from the Most Holy Place. This event signifies the removal of barriers between God and humanity, allowing direct access to God through Jesus Christ's sacrifice. The phrase 'from top to bottom' emphasizes the divine action of this tearing, rather than a human effort.|
|MRK 15:39|And when the centurion who stood opposite him saw that he cried out and breathed his last, he said, "Truly, this man was the Son of God."|The phrase 'truly this man was the Son of God' captures both the affirmation of Jesus’ divine sonship and the centurion's realization of His identity after witnessing His death.
