| Reference | Verse | Translation Notes |
|:---------:|-------|-------------------|
|1JN 2:1|My dear children, I am writing these things to you so that you may not sin. But if anyone does sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous.|In this verse, John addresses his readers affectionately as 'my little children', emphasizing the relationship and care he has for them. The term 'advocate' (παράκλητον) conveys the idea of someone who pleads on our behalf. The mention of Jesus as 'righteous' underlines His sinless nature and His role as the mediator between God and humanity.|
|1JN 2:2|And He is the atoning sacrifice for our sins, and not for ours only, but also for the sins of the whole world.|This verse emphasizes the universal scope of Christ's atoning sacrifice, underscoring that His role as an advocate is not limited to just a select group, but extends to all humanity.|
|1JN 2:3|And by this we know that we have come to know Him: if we keep His commandments.|The verse emphasizes the importance of obedience to God's commandments as a sign of knowing Him. The verb 'γινώσκομεν' (we know) is closely linked with practical action ('τηρῶμεν' - we keep) reflecting a dynamic relationship between knowledge of God and the fulfillment of His commands.|
|1JN 2:4|The one who says, 'I have come to know Him,' but does not keep His commandments is a liar, and the truth is not in him.|This verse emphasizes the relationship between knowledge of God and obedience to His commands. The term 'liar' reflects the serious nature of claiming to know God without following His commandments, highlighting the inconsistency of such a claim. The phrase 'the truth is not in him' points to a profound spiritual emptiness in the life of one who does not obey God.|
|1JN 2:5|But whoever keeps His word, in him the love of God is truly perfected. By this we know that we are in Him.|This verse emphasizes the relationship between keeping God's word and the perfection of His love within us. The Greek term 'τηρῇ' indicates a careful observance or guarding of His word, which directly correlates to the reality of experiencing God's love. The term 'ἀληθῶς' (truly) underscores the authenticity of this relationship, while 'τετελείωται' (perfected) reflects a continuous process of completion and maturity in love.|
|1JN 2:6|He who claims to abide in Him ought himself also to walk just as He walked.|This translation emphasizes the necessity of remaining in Christ and following His example, drawing from the original Greek to express the moral obligation implied in the verse.|
|1JN 2:7|Beloved, I am not writing a new commandment to you, but an old commandment that you have had from the beginning; this old commandment is the message which you heard from the beginning.|The term 'old commandment' refers to the foundational teaching of love that has been a consistent theme throughout the Scriptures. This verse reinforces the continuity of the message of love in the Christian faith, echoing what was taught from the beginning.|
|1JN 2:8|Again, I write a new commandment to you, which is true in Him and in you, because the darkness is passing away, and the true light is already shining.|This verse emphasizes the contrast between light and darkness, highlighting the truth and revelation that come through Christ. The use of 'new commandment' serves to refresh the understanding of God's truth that has been made manifest through Jesus.|
|1JN 2:9|Whoever claims to be in the light but hates his brother is still in darkness to this very moment.|This verse emphasizes the contrast between light and darkness in the context of love and brotherhood, highlighting the inconsistency of claiming to be in the light while harboring hate.|
|1JN 2:10|The one who loves his brother abides in the light, and there is no cause for stumbling in him.|The phrase 'the one loving his brother' emphasizes an active and continuous state of love. The term 'light' symbolizes moral clarity and truth, while 'scandal' refers to an offense or stumbling block in one's life. The original Greek construction indicates that those who love remain in this light, and therefore do not stumble into moral errors.|
|1JN 2:11|But the one who hates his brother is in darkness and walks in darkness, and does not know where he is going, because the darkness has blinded his eyes.|This verse emphasizes the moral implications of hatred among believers, portraying the serious consequences of living in darkness instead of light. The use of 'darkness' and 'blindness' indicates a spiritual condition that results from hatred towards one's brother, reflecting a significant theme in the Johannine literature.|
|1JN 2:12|I am writing to you, little children, because your sins have been forgiven you for His name's sake.|This verse speaks of forgiveness in the context of spiritual children and emphasizes the reason for this forgiveness being linked to His name. The term 'children' denotes the close relationship believers have with God, and 'forgiveness of sins' emphasizes the grace extended to them.|
|1JN 2:13|I am writing to you, fathers, because you have come to know Him who is from the beginning. I am writing to you, young men, because you have overcome the evil one.|This verse addresses two distinct groups within the church: fathers and young men. The use of 'know' indicates a deep understanding or relationship with God that comes from a lifelong pursuit of Him, especially relevant to the fathers. The young men are commended for their victories over evil, highlighting the empowerment given through faith in Christ.|
|1JN 2:14|I have written to you, children, because you have come to know the Father. I have written to you, fathers, because you have known Him who is from the beginning. I have written to you, young men, because you are strong, and the word of God abides in you, and you have overcome the wicked one.|In this verse, the writer distinguishes between different spiritual maturity levels within the Christian community, using terms that convey both knowledge and relationship with God. The repetition of 'I write to you' serves to emphasize the importance of these truths to each group mentioned.|
|1JN 2:15|Do not love the world, nor the things that are in the world. If anyone loves the world, the love of the Father is not in him.|In this verse, the apostle John warns against the love of the world and its enticements. The phrase 'love the world' is used to denote an attachment or affection towards worldly things that may lead one away from the love of God. The 'love of the Father' represents a genuine connection with God, contrasting the affection for worldly pursuits. The use of 'κόσμος' (world) implies not just the physical realm but the systems, values, and practices contrary to God’s nature.|
|1JN 2:16|For all that is in the world—the craving of the flesh, the craving of the eyes, and the pride of life—does not come from the Father, but is of the world.|In this translation, I have focused on conveying the idea that the desires and arrogance associated with worldly life do not originate from God. The words 'desire of the flesh,' 'desire of the eyes,' and 'pride of life' are meant to illustrate the three areas of temptation that distract believers from God. The emphasis is placed on their worldly source rather than divine.|
|1JN 2:17|And the world is passing away along with its desires; but whoever does the will of God abides forever.|The phrase 'the world is passing away' indicates the transient nature of earthly desires, while 'the one who does the will of God remains forever' emphasizes the enduring nature of living according to God's commandments. The contrast highlights the eternal significance of pursuing God's will in contrast to the fleeting nature of worldly pursuits.|
|1JN 2:18|Children, it is the last hour; and as you have heard that the Antichrist is coming, so now many antichrists have arisen. Therefore, we know that it is the last hour.|The phrase 'ἐσχάτη ὥρα' translates directly to 'last hour', indicating a critical time in the eschatological framework of the text. The use of 'ἀντίχριστος' refers to the figure known as the Antichrist, but also emphasizes the presence of many who oppose Christ, thus supporting the urgency of the warning.|
|1JN 2:19|They went out from us, but they were not of us; for if they had been of us, they would have continued with us. But they went out, that it might become plain that they all are not of us.|This verse emphasizes the distinction between true believers and those who merely appeared to be part of the community. The phrase 'ex hēmōn' (ἐξ ἡμῶν) indicates that while they outwardly belonged, their departure reveals their true nature. The terms 'remain' and 'manifest' highlight the difference between genuine faith and superficial allegiance.|
|1JN 2:20|But you have an anointing from the Holy One, and you know all things.|In this verse, the use of 'anointing' refers to the special empowerment and insight believers receive from the Holy Spirit, emphasizing their knowledge and discernment that is distinct from the world.|
|1JN 2:21|I did not write to you because you do not know the truth, but because you know it, and because every lie is not from the truth.|The translation emphasizes the distinction between knowing the truth and the absence of falsehood. The phrase 'the truth' is used to affirm the believers' knowledge in contrast to the deceptions prevalent in the world. The context is aimed at reassuring believers of their understanding and the reliability of what they know in light of false teachings.|
|1JN 2:22|Who is the liar but he who denies that Jesus is the Christ? This one is the Antichrist, who denies the Father and the Son.|This translation aims to capture the essence of the Greek text while clarifying the meaning in contemporary English. The term 'Antichrist' is preserved as it holds significant theological implications within the context of Christian doctrine. The structure is slightly adjusted to enhance clarity without losing the original meaning.|
|1JN 2:23|Everyone who denies the Son does not have the Father; whoever confesses the Son has the Father also.|The Greek term 'ἀρνούμενος' (arnoumenos) is translated here as 'denying,' capturing the essence of rejecting or refusing acknowledgment. The structure emphasizes that one cannot possess a relationship with God the Father if one denies the Son, reflecting the strong interdependence of their relationship in Christian theology.|
|1JN 2:24|Therefore, let what you heard from the beginning remain in you. If what you heard from the beginning abides in you, you will also abide in the Son and in the Father.|This verse emphasizes the importance of holding onto the original teachings received from the beginning, which is a recurrent theme in John's letters. The concept of 'remaining' or 'abiding' in both the message and the relationship with the Father and Son is vital for spiritual perseverance and unity.|
|1JN 2:25|And this is the promise that He has promised us: eternal life.|In this verse, 'the promise' refers to the assurance of eternal life that God has pledged to His people. The emphasis on the certainty of this promise aligns with the broader themes found throughout the New Testament concerning God's faithfulness and the eternal hope provided through faith in Christ.|
|1JN 2:26|I have written these things to you concerning those who would deceive you.|In this verse, the Apostle John addresses the issue of those who lead believers astray. The term 'πλανώντων' relates to deception, highlighting the spiritual dangers faced by the early church. John's emphasis on the need for vigilance against false teachings resonates throughout the New Testament, where believers are cautioned against deception.|
|1JN 2:27|But as for you, the anointing that you received from Him abides in you, and you have no need for anyone to teach you; but as His anointing teaches you about everything, and is true and is not a lie, and just as it has taught you, you abide in Him.|This verse emphasizes the permanence of the anointing received from the Holy Spirit and affirms that believers do not need additional teaching because they have the truth of the Holy Spirit within them. The Greek term 'χρῖσμα' refers to the anointing, often understood in the context of the Holy Spirit's presence and teaching in a believer's life.|
|1JN 2:28|And now, little children, abide in Him, so that when He is revealed, we may have confidence and not be ashamed before Him at His coming.|This verse emphasizes the importance of remaining steadfast in faith and living a life that reflects our relationship with Christ, particularly as we anticipate His return. The concepts of confidence and shame in His presence are central to the believer's conduct.|
|1JN 2:29|If you know that He is righteous, you may be sure that everyone who practices righteousness has been born of Him.|This verse emphasizes the relationship between righteousness and the nature of being born of God. The original Greek term 'δίκαιός' refers to the quality of being just or righteous, which is a fundamental characteristic of God and those born of Him. The phrase 'ἐξ αὐτοῦ γεγέννηται' underscores the notion that those who practice righteousness demonstrate their true identity as children of God.|
