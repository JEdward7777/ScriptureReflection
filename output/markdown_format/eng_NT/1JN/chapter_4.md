|1JN 4:1|Beloved, do not believe every spirit, but test the spirits to see whether they are from God, because many false prophets have gone out into the world.|This verse emphasizes the importance of discernment in the Christian faith, calling believers to critically evaluate spiritual influences in their lives. The term 'spirits' refers not only to supernatural beings but also to the teachings and messages they convey. The original Greek conveys a strong caution against accepting every spiritual claim without scrutiny, highlighting the presence of many false prophets.|

Key terms such as 'spirit', 'confess', and 'come in the flesh' are integral to understanding the core Christian belief in Jesus' divine and human nature.|
|1JN 4:3|And every spirit that does not confess that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is not from God. This is the spirit of the antichrist, which you heard was coming, and now is already in the world.|In this translation, care has been taken to capture the emphasis on the recognition of Christâ€™s incarnation as a vital test of the spirits.

This captures the distinction between believers and non-believers in terms of their origin and perspective.|

The argument presented suggests that genuine love for God is evidenced by love towards others, particularly those who are seen and known, as loving the unseen God is impossible without love for His creation.|
