| Reference | Verse | Translation Notes |
|:---------:|-------|-------------------|
|1JN 3:1|See what kind of love the Father has given to us, that we should be called children of God; and so we are! The reason why the world does not know us is that it did not know him.|This verse emphasizes the extraordinary nature of God's love which grants believers the status of children of God, contrasting it with the world's inability to recognize this relationship. The translation seeks to capture the essence of God's affectionate gift and the resulting identity as His children.|
|1JN 3:2|Beloved, we are now children of God, and what we will be has not yet been made known; but we know that when he appears, we shall be like him, because we shall see him as he is.|In this verse, the Apostle John emphasizes the current identity of believers as children of God and the future hope of being transformed to be like Christ when he is revealed. The Greek term 'φαίνεται' (phanerōthē) implies a future revelation, while 'ὅμοιοι' (homoi) suggests a likeness that will be shared with Christ. This translation seeks to preserve the essence of anticipation and identity in the life of believers.|
|1JN 3:3|And everyone who has this hope in Him purifies himself, just as He is pure.|The phrase 'everyone who has this hope' refers to the anticipation of being like Christ. The verb 'purifies' signifies an active effort to live a holy life, in response to the hope we have in Him, who is Himself pure. The word 'pure' here underlines the character of Christ and the expected transformation in believers.|
|1JN 3:4|Everyone who practices sin also practices lawlessness; and sin is lawlessness.|In this verse, the terms 'sin' and 'lawlessness' are critically linked. Sin is presented not just as a moral failing, but as a violation of God's law. The focus on those who practice sin emphasizes a continual state rather than isolated actions, underscoring a relationship with sin that reflects one's nature.|
|1JN 3:5|And you know that He was manifested to take away our sins, and in Him there is no sin.|In this verse, the Apostle John emphasizes the purpose of Christ's manifestation in relation to sin. The word 'ἐφανερώθη' (was manifested) indicates a divine revelation of Jesus, specifically for the purpose of removing our sins ('ἁμαρτίας ἡμῶν' - our sins). The declaration that 'ἁμαρτία ἐν αὐτῷ οὐκ ἔστι' (there is no sin in Him) affirms the sinless nature of Christ, which is a foundational belief in Christian theology regarding the efficacy of His atoning sacrifice.|
|1JN 3:6|Everyone who abides in Him does not sin; everyone who sins has neither seen Him nor known Him.|This verse emphasizes the distinction between those who remain in fellowship with Christ and those who persist in sin. The terms used for 'sinning' and 'knowing' reflect a deeper relational understanding that goes beyond mere action to include a recognition of identity in Christ.|
|1JN 3:7|Little children, let no one lead you astray; the one who practices righteousness is righteous, just as He is righteous.|In this verse, the term 'children' (τεκνία) is used to emphasize the relationship between believers and God. The imperative 'let no one deceive you' underscores the importance of discernment in recognizing true righteousness, which is a reflection of God's own character. The phrase 'the one who practices righteousness' indicates an ongoing action that demonstrates one’s relationship with God.|
|1JN 3:8|The one who commits sin is of the devil, for the devil has been sinning from the beginning. The Son of God appeared for this purpose: to destroy the works of the devil.|This translation emphasizes the contrast between the actions of the one who commits sin and the purpose of Christ’s coming. It highlights the origin of sin and its association with the devil, while also stating the mission of Jesus as a solution to that problem.|
|1JN 3:9|Everyone who has been born of God does not commit sin, because His seed remains in him; and he cannot sin, because he has been born of God.|This verse emphasizes the idea that those who are truly born of God will not engage in sinful behavior, reflecting their new nature as children of God. The terms 'born' and 'seed' connect back to the theme of spiritual rebirth, emphasizing a transformative identity that separates the believer from sin.|
|1JN 3:10|In this, the children of God and the children of the devil are manifest: Anyone who does not practice righteousness is not of God, nor is he who does not love his brother.|In this verse, the apostle John contrasts the children of God with the children of the devil. The emphasis is on righteous actions and love for one's brother as key indicators of true parentage in the spiritual sense. The original terms for 'children' (τέκνα) suggest a deep familial connection, and the phrase 'not loving' (οὐκ ἀγαπῶν) signifies a lack of genuine brotherly affection that is essential in the Christian faith.|
|1JN 3:11|For this is the message that you heard from the beginning, that we should love one another.|This verse emphasizes the importance of loving one another as a fundamental teaching received from the very beginning of the Christian faith. The use of 'ἀγγελία' (message) indicates a core principle of the Christian doctrine, particularly regarding mutual love among believers.|
|1JN 3:12|not as Cain, who was of the evil one and murdered his brother. And why did he murder him? Because his own deeds were evil, but his brother's were righteous.|This verse contrasts the actions of Cain, who was influenced by evil and committed fratricide, with the righteousness of Abel. It serves as a warning against hatred and evil actions among believers, emphasizing the importance of love and righteousness.|
|1JN 3:13|Do not be surprised, brothers, if the world hates you.|This verse expresses a warning to believers regarding the world's attitude towards them, encouraging them to not be surprised or disheartened by hatred from the world, as it is a common experience for those who follow Christ. The emphasis is on the expected conflict between believers and the values of the world.|
|1JN 3:14|We know that we have passed from death to life because we love our brothers. Whoever does not love remains in death.|This verse highlights the transition from spiritual death to spiritual life, which is evidenced by love for fellow believers. The emphasis on love as the marker of true life in Christ is central to John's message. The Greek term used for 'love' signifies a selfless, sacrificial affection that should characterize the community of faith. The phrase 'remains in death' indicates a serious spiritual state for those who do not express this love.|
|1JN 3:15|Everyone who hates his brother is a murderer, and you know that no murderer has eternal life abiding in him.|This verse highlights the grave consequences of hatred, equating it with murder, and emphasizing the absence of eternal life in those who harbor such animosity. The terms used—'hate', 'murderer', and 'eternal life'—are central themes that interconnect with other New Testament teachings about love and brotherhood.|
|1JN 3:16|By this we know love, that He laid down His life for us, and we ought to lay down our lives for our brothers.|This verse emphasizes the sacrificial nature of love demonstrated by Christ and calls believers to express this same love towards one another. The term 'soul' refers to life or existence, stressing the weight of the sacrifice made.|
|1JN 3:17|But whoever has this world's goods and sees his brother in need, yet shuts his heart against him, how can the love of God remain in him?|This verse highlights the importance of compassion and the genuine expression of love through action, especially towards those in need. The term 'closes his heart' signifies a deliberate choice to ignore the plight of others, contrasting sharply with the Christian call to love and serve. The phrase 'the love of God' refers to the transformative power of divine love which should manifest in our actions.|
|1JN 3:18|Little children, let us not love in word or talk but in deed and in truth.|In this verse, the author emphasizes that love should be demonstrated through actions and truth, rather than merely through words or speech. The term 'deeds' refers to tangible actions that reflect one’s love for others, aligning with the overarching theme of love in the surrounding context.|
|1JN 3:19|And by this we shall know that we are of the truth, and we will assure our hearts before Him.|This translation focuses on the assurance we have in knowing that we belong to the truth and emphasizes the confidence we have before God. The phrase 'in this' connects to the previous call to love in truth and deed, highlighting the unity of love and truth in the life of believers.|
|1JN 3:20|For if our heart condemns us, God is greater than our heart and knows all things.|In this verse, John contrasts human judgment with God's omniscience. The heart represents human understanding and emotions, while God is affirmed as greater, possessing complete knowledge of all things, including the hidden aspects of our hearts.|
|1JN 3:21|Beloved, if our heart does not condemn us, we have confidence before God.|This verse speaks to the assurance and confidence we can have before God when our hearts do not condemn us. It highlights the importance of a clear conscience and the relationship of love and truth with God, emphasizing that when our hearts are aligned with His, we can approach Him boldly.|
|1JN 3:22|And whatever we ask, we receive from Him, because we keep His commandments and do those things that are pleasing in His sight.|This verse emphasizes the connection between obedience to God's commandments and the receiving of answers to prayer. The original Greek uses a conditional structure to suggest that our petitions are answered when they are aligned with God's will and when we are living according to His commandments. This translation seeks to preserve that nuance while making it clear in contemporary English.|
|1JN 3:23|And this is His command: that we should believe in the name of His Son, Jesus Christ, and love one another just as He commanded us.|This translation aims to capture the essence of the commandment given by Jesus, emphasizing both belief in His name and the call to love one another. It closely follows the structure of the original Greek while making it accessible and clear in English.|
|1JN 3:24|And the one who keeps His commandments abides in Him, and He in them. And by this we know that He abides in us: by the Spirit whom He has given us.|In this verse, the concepts of obedience to God's commandments and the indwelling of the Spirit are central. The relationship between abiding in God and His commandments is emphasized, which is consistent with the themes found in other passages of Scripture, particularly in the Gospel of John and the epistles of Paul. The translation reflects both the intimate relationship between believers and God, as well as the assurance given through the Holy Spirit.|
