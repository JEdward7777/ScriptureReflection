The connection between blood and the field serves as a stark reminder of the consequences of betrayal.|
|ACT 1:20|For it is written in the book of Psalms: ‘Let his dwelling place be desolate, and let there be no one to inhabit it’; and ‘Let another take his office.’|This verse quotes from the Psalms to emphasize the judgment and vacancy that has befallen a particular house, likely in reference to Judas' betrayal and the need for leadership in the apostolic community.
