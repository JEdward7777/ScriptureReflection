The use of 'reasoned' suggests a dialogical approach rather than merely preaching, while 'much multitude' indicates significant success in their ministry.|
|ACT 14:2|But the unbelieving Jews stirred up and poisoned the minds of the Gentiles against the brothers.|The term 'ἀπειθοῦντες' (those who disbelieved) highlights the resistance from certain Jewish leaders against the gospel. 'ἐπήγειραν' (they stirred up) signifies an active agitation among the people. 'ἐκάκωσαν' (they embittered) indicates a deep emotional distress inflicted upon the souls of the Gentiles, portraying the severity of their actions against the apostles.|
|ACT 14:3|Therefore, they spent a considerable amount of time speaking boldly for the Lord, who bore witness to the word of His grace, granting signs and wonders to be performed by their hands.|In this verse, the emphasis is on the courageous proclamation of God's message and the miraculous signs accompanying the apostles' testimony. The term 'παρρησιαζόμενοι' implies boldness in speech, a common theme in the early Church as seen in Acts and the epistles. The phrase 'μαρτυροῦντι τῷ λόγῳ τῆς χάριτος' highlights the nature of the message being delivered, which is centered on God's grace.|

This theme of division is echoed in various parts of Scripture, emphasizing the conflict arising from the Gospel's proclamation.|
|ACT 14:5|When an assault was made by both the Gentiles and the Jews, along with their rulers, to mistreat and stone them,|In this verse, the term 'ὁρμὴ' (onrush) indicates a sudden and intense attack by a group, reflective of the hostile actions against the apostles. The word 'υβρίσαι' (to insult or mistreat) captures the aggressive intent of the mob. 'λιθοβολῆσαι' (to stone) denotes the ultimate violence they intended to carry out against Paul and Barnabas. This translation aims to convey the gravity of the situation as it reflects the trials faced by the apostles in their ministry.|
|ACT 14:6|Aware of the plot against them, they fled to the cities of Lycaonia, Lystra, and Derbe, and the surrounding region.|The verse describes the response of Paul and Barnabas to threats against their safety.

|ACT 14:7|And there they were proclaiming the good news.|In this verse, the verb 'εὐαγγελιζόμενοι' (euangelizomenoi) means 'proclaiming the good news' or 'preaching the gospel.' The context indicates the Apostles were actively engaged in spreading the message of Christ in Lycaonia despite facing persecution.|
|ACT 14:8|And in Lystra, a certain man sat who was unable to walk, crippled from his mother’s womb, who had never walked.|The phrase 'a certain man' is common in scripture to introduce someone in need of healing. The emphasis on the man's condition from birth highlights the severity of his situation, and 'lame' conveys both physical incapacity and a sense of being an outcast. The mention of him sitting suggests a state of passivity, which contrasts with the active ministry of the apostles in the preceding context.|
|ACT 14:9|This man heard Paul speaking. Paul, observing him intently and seeing that he had faith to be healed,|This verse highlights the importance of faith in the context of listening and recognizing God's message. The word 'hearing' is pivotal in both the action of listening and the understanding that leads to faith.

|ACT 14:11|But when the crowds saw what Paul had done, they raised their voices, saying in Lycaonian, 'The gods have come down to us in the likeness of men!'|In this verse, the crowd reacts to a miraculous act performed by Paul, interpreting it as a divine manifestation. The term 'gods' here signifies the ancient belief systems that often attributed supernatural qualities to human figures, reflecting a common practice in Hellenistic culture. The expression of 'having become like men' captures the essence of how the miraculous is misinterpreted through a lens of idolatry and polytheism.|
|ACT 14:12|And they called Barnabas Zeus, and Paul they called Hermes, because he was the chief speaker.|In this verse, the people are attributing divine roles to Paul and Barnabas, reflecting the ancient cultural tendency to identify mortals with gods.

The names 'Jupiter' (in Latin) and 'Hermes' (in Greek) suggest their understanding of Paul and Barnabas in the context of their own cultural beliefs.|
|ACT 14:13|But the priest of Zeus, whose temple was just outside their city, brought bulls and wreaths to the gates, intending with the crowds to offer a sacrifice.|This verse depicts the local priest of Zeus taking initiative to honor the perceived divine presence of Paul and Barnabas with sacrifices, illustrating the pagan context of worship in Lystra and the misunderstanding of the apostles' role as messengers of the one true God.|
|ACT 14:14|But when the apostles Barnabas and Paul heard of it, they tore their clothes and rushed into the crowd, crying out,|In this verse, the tearing of clothes signifies deep distress and urgency in response to the people's actions. This reflects the apostles' commitment to convey the truth of the gospel against idolatry.|
|ACT 14:15|Men, why are you doing these things? We are also men, just like you, and we bring you good news, turning you from these worthless things to the living God, who made the heaven and the earth and the sea and everything in them.|In this verse, Paul and Barnabas express their humanity to prevent the people from attributing divine status to them. They emphasize that they are merely messengers calling others to turn from vain practices to the worship of the living God, who is the Creator of all things.|
|ACT 14:16|In past generations, He allowed all nations to go their own ways.|This verse reflects on God's patience with the nations throughout history, allowing them to follow their own paths, but indicates a transition as the gospel is presented to them. The term 'nations' refers to Gentiles and emphasizes God's previous forbearance. It also ties into the themes of repentance and turning to God as highlighted in Acts 17:30.|
|ACT 14:17|Yet He did not leave Himself without witness, for He did good by giving you rains from heaven and fruitful seasons, filling your hearts with food and gladness.|This verse emphasizes God's continual goodness towards humanity, showing how He provides blessings, such as rain and fruitful seasons, which serve as manifestations of His grace and sustenance for the heart and soul.|
|ACT 14:18|Even saying these things, they barely restrained the crowds from offering sacrifices to them.|This translation captures the urgency and the difficulty of restraining the crowd from engaging in idol worship. The use of 'barely' emphasizes the struggle of Paul and Barnabas to stop the people's actions. The term 'sacrificing' is deliberately chosen to reflect the common act of worship in the context of idol ceremonies, reinforcing the seriousness of the situation.|
|ACT 14:19|But Jews came from Antioch and Iconium, and having persuaded the crowds, they stoned Paul and dragged him out of the city, supposing that he was dead.|The Greek word 'λιθάσαντες' indicates the act of stoning, a form of capital punishment for blasphemy and other serious offenses in ancient Jewish law. The context here implies a misunderstanding of Paul's message, leading to his violent treatment by the Jews. The phrase 'νομίσαντες αὐτὸν τεθνάναι' reflects their assumption about Paul's death after the stoning, showcasing the gravity of the mob's actions.|
|ACT 14:20|But when the disciples gathered around him, he rose up and entered the city; and the next day he went out with Barnabas to Derbe.|The phrase 'having gathered around him' indicates a protective act by the disciples after Paul's stoning, reflecting their support and concern for him. 'He arose' signifies his recovery, a moment of divine intervention, which aligns with themes of resurrection and new life throughout scripture. 'Entered the city' reflects Paul's resilience and commitment to his mission despite the danger he faced, paralleling other instances where believers persist in their calling. The next day's departure with Barnabas to Derbe emphasizes their continuing journey and work in spreading the Gospel despite persecution.|
|ACT 14:21|After preaching the gospel in that city and winning many to faith, they returned to Lystra, Iconium, and Antioch.|In this verse, the emphasis is on the act of preaching (evangelizing) and making disciples, reflecting the mission of the early church.

The original text highlights the communal aspect of this process, as well as the commitment of these leaders to the Lord in whom they have placed their faith. 'Handpicking' elders carries the connotation of careful selection and spiritual authority.|
|ACT 14:24|And after traversing Pisidia, they arrived in Pamphylia.|The term 'through' is used to indicate movement across regions, aligning with the original Greek text's implication of a journey. The geographical references are also preserved for contextual clarity.|
|ACT 14:25|And after speaking the word in Perga, they descended to Attalia.|The Greek term 'καὶ λαλήσαντες' suggests active preaching or speaking of the word, which can also imply teaching.
