|ACT 25:1|Therefore, when Festus had arrived in the province after three days, he went up to Jerusalem from Caesarea.|In this translation, I've maintained the context of movement from one location to another, as well as the implication of authority and governance that the original Greek conveys. The name 'Festus' is transliterated directly as it represents a proper noun, and 'three days' has been translated for clarity.|
|ACT 25:2|Then the high priest and the prominent leaders of the Jews brought their accusations against Paul before Festus, earnestly requesting him.|In this verse, the word 'chief priest' and 'first ones' indicates authority and prominence among the Jewish leaders. The verb 'appeared' carries the sense of making an urgent and public demonstration, aligning with the context of presenting accusations.|
|ACT 25:3|They were asking him for a favor concerning Paul, to have him transferred to Jerusalem, while they were planning an ambush to kill him along the way.|The original Greek phrase 'αἰτούμενοι χάριν' conveys the idea of requesting favor or a privilege, while 'μεταπέμψηται' suggests sending or transferring someone. The phrase 'ἐνέδραν ποιοῦντες' means making a plot or ambush. Thus, the translation should capture both the request to send Paul to Jerusalem and the underlying intent of the Jewish leaders to ambush him on the way.|

This reflects the legal proceedings that were taking place and Festus’s role as a new governor in maintaining order and justice in the province.|
|ACT 25:5|Therefore, let those who are influential among you, he said, go down with me, and if there is anything wrong with this man, let them bring their charges against him.|This translation captures the formal tone and the judicial context of the original text, reflecting the call for examination and accusation in a legal setting.|

The structure mirrors formal legal speech, affirming his commitment to lawfulness and integrity in his actions.|

|ACT 25:12|Then Festus, having conferred with the council, answered, 'To Caesar you have appealed; to Caesar you shall go.'|In this verse, the formal declaration of Festus signifies the procedural aspect of legal appeals in Roman governance. The term 'Caesar' refers not only to the individual ruler but represents the ultimate authority in legal matters of the time, emphasizing the significance of Paul’s appeal.|
|ACT 25:13|Now after some days had passed, King Agrippa and Bernice arrived in Caesarea to pay their respects to Festus.|This verse describes the arrival of King Agrippa and Bernice to Caesarea to greet Festus.

The term 'ἀναβολὴν' refers to a postponement or delay, which reflects the Roman legal system's emphasis on order and fairness. The use of 'ἐκέλευσα' indicates an authoritative command from Festus, highlighting his role as the judge in this situation.|

|ACT 25:19|But they had certain disputes with him about their own superstitions and about a Jesus who had died, whom Paul asserted to be alive.|This verse discusses the topics of religious belief and the resurrection, which were significant in Paul's teachings and defense.

Festus replied, 'Tomorrow you shall hear him.'|In this verse, the interaction between Agrippa and Festus emphasizes Agrippa's desire to hear from Paul directly. The phrase 'I also wanted to hear this man' reflects a common theme in Acts where figures of authority seek to understand the faith and claims of the apostles. The use of the term 'hear' indicates a desire for knowledge and understanding, which aligns with the broader theme of faith stemming from hearing the word.|
|ACT 25:23|So on the next day, when Agrippa and Bernice had come with great pomp and had entered the auditorium with the commanders and the prominent men of the city, Festus commanded that Paul be brought in.|The phrase 'with great pomp' suggests a ceremonial and impressive arrival, which reflects the status of Agrippa and Bernice.

|ACT 25:27|For it seems unreasonable to me to send a prisoner without specifying the charges against him.|In this verse, the emphasis is on the irrationality of sending a prisoner without presenting clear charges against him.
