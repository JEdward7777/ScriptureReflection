|:---------:|-------|-------------------|
|ACT 5:1|But a man named Ananias, with his wife Sapphira, sold a piece of property.|The term 'Ἀνανίας' is translated as 'Ananias', retaining its Greek form due to its specific reference to the individual. The term 'σὺν Σαπφείρῃ' is rendered as 'together with his wife Sapphira' to maintain the original meaning of unity in their action. The verb 'ἐπώλησε' is translated as 'sold' to convey the action directly, while 'κτῆμα' is rendered as 'property' to be more familiar in contemporary English.|
|ACT 5:2|And he withdrew from the honor, together with his wife, and brought a portion of the proceeds and laid it at the feet of the apostles.|This verse highlights the act of Ananias separating himself from the honor he was supposed to give, along with his wife, Sapphira. The use of 'part' suggests a deliberate choice to withhold truth and integrity in his actions, while the act of laying it at the feet of the apostles shows an outward appearance of generosity that contradicts his inward reality.|
|ACT 5:3|But Peter said, "Ananias, why has Satan filled your heart to lie to the Holy Spirit and keep back part of the price of the land for yourself?|In this verse, Peter addresses Ananias, questioning why Satan has filled his heart to deceive the Holy Spirit and to withhold a part of the proceeds. The terms used reflect the seriousness of lying and the influence of evil, which ties back to the earlier mention of bringing a portion of the proceeds dishonestly.|
|ACT 5:4|Wasn't it yours to keep? And after it was sold, wasn't the money at your disposal? Why then did you conceive this deed in your heart? You have not lied to men, but to God.|In this verse, the emphasis is on the ownership and authority of Ananias over his actions and the severe consequence of his deceit, which is aimed not merely at humans but at God Himself.

|ACT 5:7|Now it was about three hours later when his wife came in, not knowing what had happened.|This verse describes the moment when the wife of Ananias, unaware of her husband's fate, entered the scene three hours later. The use of 'three hours' signifies a specific time interval that adds to the dramatic unfolding of the story. The phrase 'not knowing' emphasizes her ignorance of the situation, contrasting with the grave event that had just taken place.|

This translation aims to maintain the urgency and clarity of the original Greek while being faithful to the context of the apostles' mission.|

But the high priest and those with him came and called together the council and all the senate of the children of Israel, and sent to the prison to have them brought.|In this verse, we see the urgency and action taken by the high priest and the council after hearing that the apostles were teaching in the temple. The terms used for 'high priest' and 'council' reflect the Jewish leadership structure at the time, and the phrase 'sent to the prison to bring them' captures the tension of the situation as the apostles defied their orders.|

The men whom you put in prison are standing in the temple and teaching the people.'|This verse captures the urgency and astonishment of the announcement made to the religious leaders regarding the apostles’ actions. The use of 'standing' (ἑστῶτες) in reference to the apostles is significant, indicating their active participation in teaching in the temple, which was in direct defiance of the authorities' orders. 'Teaching the people' (διδάσκοντες τὸν λαόν) emphasizes the apostles' mission and commitment to spreading their message despite the risks involved.|
