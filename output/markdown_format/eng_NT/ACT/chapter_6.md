| Reference | Verse | Translation Notes |
|:---------:|-------|-------------------|
|ACT 6:1|Now during those days, as the number of disciples was increasing, there arose a complaint from the Hellenists against the Hebrews, because their widows were being neglected in the daily distribution.|This verse highlights a critical moment in the early church when division arose due to unmet needs. The Greek term 'γογγυσμὸς' (goggyismos) specifically indicates murmuring or complaining, often used in contexts of dissatisfaction. This reflects a struggle between different cultural groups within the church, which was an important issue in the early Christian community.|
|ACT 6:2|So the Twelve gathered all the disciples together and said, "It is not right for us to neglect the ministry of the word of God in order to wait on tables."|In this verse, the apostles prioritize their ministry of preaching the Word of God over serving tables, reflecting their commitment to spiritual leadership and the importance of teaching.|
|ACT 6:3|Therefore, brothers, select from among you seven men of good reputation, full of the Holy Spirit and wisdom, whom we may appoint to this duty.|This verse emphasizes the importance of selecting qualified individuals to assist in the ministry, highlighting their character and spiritual endowment. The phrase 'full of the Holy Spirit and wisdom' signifies a deep spiritual maturity and discernment necessary for leadership within the church.|
|ACT 6:4|But we will devote ourselves to prayer and to the ministry of the word.|The verse emphasizes the commitment to prayer and the ministry of the Word as primary responsibilities. The term ' προσκαρτερήσομεν ' conveys a sense of steadfastness and dedication.|
|ACT 6:5|And this proposal pleased the whole gathering; and they chose Stephen, a man full of faith and the Holy Spirit, and Philip, Prochorus, Nicanor, Timon, Parmenas, and Nicolas, a proselyte from Antioch.|This translation emphasizes the qualifications of Stephen as being 'full of faith and the Holy Spirit,' which highlights his character and readiness for service. The names of the other chosen men are preserved to show the diverse leadership in the early church, and the term 'pleasing' conveys the approval of the congregation for their selection.|
|ACT 6:6|They presented these men to the apostles, who prayed and laid their hands on them.|The phrase 'laid their hands on them' indicates a ceremonial action signifying the conferral of authority or blessing. In the context of Acts, this act often accompanies prayer, indicating a solemn dedication to a task or role within the church.|
|ACT 6:7|And the word of God increased, and the number of the disciples in Jerusalem multiplied greatly, and a great many of the priests became obedient to the faith.|This verse highlights the growth of the word of God and the increase in the number of disciples in Jerusalem, emphasizing the effectiveness of the apostles' ministry. It also notes the response of many priests to the faith, indicating a significant impact on the Jewish religious community.|
|ACT 6:8|And Stephen, full of faith and power, did great wonders and miracles among the people.|This verse emphasizes the role of Stephen as a powerful figure filled with faith and ability to perform miracles among the people, connecting his actions to the ongoing works of God through His servants.|
|ACT 6:9|But some from the synagogue of the Libertines, Cyrenians, Alexandrians, and those from Cilicia and Asia arose and disputed with Stephen.|The verse describes a confrontation between Stephen and certain groups from the synagogue, reflecting tensions arising from differing cultural backgrounds among the Jewish diaspora. The term 'synagogue' emphasizes the setting where such discussions and conflicts took place, while the names of the groups indicate a diverse Jewish population in Jerusalem. This highlights the early church's interactions with various Jewish communities.|
|ACT 6:10|And they were unable to withstand the wisdom and the Spirit by which he spoke.|The phrase 'did not have strength to oppose' conveys a sense of overpowering wisdom and divine assistance in Stephen's speaking, highlighting his exceptional ability to defend his faith. The terms used suggest a spiritual power beyond human comprehension.|
|ACT 6:11|Then they secretly induced men to say, 'We have heard him speak blasphemous words against Moses and against God.'|This verse illustrates the accusation made against Stephen, paralleling how falsehood and blasphemy were utilized in the trials of Jesus. The language captures the intensity of the charges against him, emphasizing the religious leaders' concerns regarding his teachings that seemingly challenged their authority and the Mosaic law.|
|ACT 6:12|So they incited the people, the elders, and the scribes, and they came upon him, seized him, and brought him before the council.|This verse depicts the escalation of hostility against Stephen. The phrase 'stirred up' indicates a mobilization of influential community members, which is significant for understanding how mob mentality can sway public opinion and lead to persecution. The reference to 'the elders and the scribes' highlights the involvement of both religious leaders and laypeople, showing a united front against Stephen.|
|ACT 6:13|They set up false witnesses who said, "This man never ceases to speak words of blasphemy against this holy place and the Law."|The term 'false witnesses' is critical as it highlights the dishonesty of the accusers. The phrase 'blasphemous words' relates directly to the Jewish law and the sanctity of the Temple. This verse sets the stage for the trial of Stephen, emphasizing the severe accusations against him.|
|ACT 6:14|For we have heard him say that this Jesus of Nazareth will destroy this place and will change the customs which Moses delivered to us.|In this verse, Stephen's accusers are reiterating the claim that Jesus of Nazareth would dismantle the temple and change the customs handed down by Moses. The terminology here points to the tension between the early Christian community and the Jewish authorities, particularly regarding the interpretation and authority of Mosaic Law and the Temple. The phrase 'this Jesus of Nazareth' emphasizes their disdain and opposition towards Jesus’ message, associating Him with the radical changes they fear.|
|ACT 6:15|And gazing at him, all who sat in the council saw that his face was like the face of an angel.|The term 'face' (πρόσωπον) in this verse is associated with divine presence and glory, commonly used to describe angels. The word 'angel' (ἄγγελος) reflects the heavenly and authoritative nature that those observing would associate with a being from God. The use of 'gaze' (ἀτενίσαντες) implies a focused, intense observation that signifies awe or reverence, which is appropriate given the context of Stephen's appearance before the Sanhedrin.|
