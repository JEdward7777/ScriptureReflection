|ACT 24:6|He even attempted to profane the temple, and we seized him, intending to judge him according to our law.|The verse expresses the accusation against Paul regarding the desecration of the temple.

The translation aims to capture both the legal context and the emotional weight of the accusation.|
|ACT 24:7|But Lysias the commander came and took him from us with great violence.|The translation maintains the original meaning while adjusting the structure to be clearer in contemporary English. The phrase 'with much violence' captures the intensity of the original Greek 'μετὰ πολλῆς βίας'.|
|ACT 24:8|Commanding his accusers to come before you, and by examining him yourself, you will be able to learn about all these things of which we accuse him.|In this verse, the emphasis is on the process of accusation and the need for the accused to confront their accusers.

This fresh translation captures the essence of hope and the specific context of resurrection for all, both righteous and unrighteous.|
|ACT 24:16|So I strive always to keep my conscience clear before God and man.|In this verse, Paul emphasizes his commitment to maintaining an unblemished conscience before God and humanity. The word 'ἀπρόσκοπον' (unblemished) highlights the importance of integrity in one’s faith and actions, a recurring theme throughout Scripture. The phrase 'διὰ παντός' (through all things) signifies a continuous effort rather than a one-time act.|
|ACT 24:17|Now after several years, I came to bring charitable gifts and offerings to my nation.|This verse reflects the practice of offering alms and contributions, which is a common theme in the teachings of the apostles.

|ACT 24:20|Or let these men themselves declare what wrongdoing they found in me while I stood before the council.|In this translation, the emphasis is placed on the accusation process, where the speaker is challenged to defend himself against the charges that have been presented. The focus remains on the lack of evidence for wrongdoing.|
|ACT 24:21|except for this one statement, which I cried out while standing among them, that I am judged today for the hope of the resurrection of the dead.|The phrase 'the resurrection of the dead' is central to Paul's defense, highlighting the core Christian belief in resurrection that sets him apart in this trial. The use of 'this one voice' emphasizes the singularity of his claim amidst the multitude of accusations.|
|ACT 24:22|But when Felix heard these things, he postponed their hearing, being more informed about the way, saying, 'When Lysias the tribune comes down, I will make a decision concerning your case.'|In this translation, I aimed to convey the deliberative nature of Felix's decision-making process, emphasizing his desire for greater understanding of the situation and the individuals involved. The term 'more accurately' reflects his careful consideration, while 'when Lysias the tribune comes down' indicates a sense of pending action that he is waiting for. This translation retains the context of judicial proceedings and highlights the authority of Felix as a governor.|
|ACT 24:23|Then he ordered the centurion to let Paul have some liberty, and he commanded that no one should prevent his friends from attending to his needs.|The verse reflects Felix's instruction to the centurion to allow Paul some freedom, demonstrating both the respect for Paul as a prisoner and the concern for his welfare. The terms 'rest' and 'no one should hinder' illustrate Felix's leniency while maintaining a degree of control over Paul's circumstances.|
|ACT 24:24|After some days, Felix came with his wife Drusilla, who was Jewish. He sent for Paul and listened to him speak about faith in Christ.|In this verse, we see the interaction between Felix, his Jewish wife Drusilla, and Paul. The phrase 'regarding the faith in Christ' emphasizes the subject of Paul's discourse, which centers on the Christian faith, a central theme throughout the New Testament.|
|ACT 24:25|As Paul spoke about righteousness, self-control, and the coming judgment, Felix became afraid and replied, "Go away for now; when I find it convenient, I will summon you."|In this verse, Felix is confronted with the themes of righteousness, self-control, and the impending judgment. The fear he experiences is a critical response to the serious topics being discussed by Paul, reflecting a moment of introspection regarding moral accountability and the future judgment. The translation captures Felix's hesitance and the notion of delaying action until a more favorable time arises.|
|ACT 24:26|At the same time, he hoped that money would be given to him by Paul, so he frequently sent for him and talked with him.|In this verse, the context centers on Felix's hope for monetary gain from Paul, which is reflective of a common theme in biblical teachings about the dangers of greed and the moral implications of seeking money through unethical means. The verb 'ἐλπίζων' indicates Felix's expectation or hope, which ties closely with the idea of being motivated by greed. The word 'λύσῃ' signifies the release or freedom he seeks, suggesting a transactional approach to justice and freedom.|
|ACT 24:27|But when two years had passed, Felix was succeeded by Porcius Festus. Wanting to do the Jews a favor, Felix left Paul in prison.|This verse describes the political situation after Felix’s term as governor, emphasizing his desire to please the Jewish leaders while leaving Paul imprisoned. The word ‘successor’ indicates the transition of power, while ‘in bonds’ conveys Paul’s continued state of imprisonment. The translation reflects the themes of governance and the challenges faced by believers under authority.|
