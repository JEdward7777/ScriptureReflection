|ACT 28:1|And after we were safely brought through, we recognized that the island was called Melita.|The term 'Melete' (Μελίτη) refers specifically to the island of Melita, which is understood to be modern-day Malta. The verb 'διασωθέντες' (having been saved) indicates a miraculous deliverance, emphasizing God's protection during the shipwreck. The verse captures the moment of realization for the survivors about their location after their perilous journey.|
|ACT 28:2|The islanders showed us extraordinary kindness; they built a fire and welcomed us all because it was raining and cold.|The word 'βάρβαροι' refers to those who were considered outsiders or non-Greeks, indicating that the people of Melita were kind and welcoming despite cultural differences. The phrase 'οὐ τὴν τυχοῦσαν φιλανθρωπίαν' can be understood as an extraordinary kindness or charity. The use of 'πυρὰν' refers to the fire that provided warmth and comfort in a difficult situation, emphasizing the generosity of the locals during adverse weather conditions.|
|ACT 28:3|But when Paul had gathered a bundle of sticks and laid them on the fire, a viper came out because of the heat and fastened on his hand.|The verse describes a vivid incident where a snake, possibly from the dry brush, latched onto Paul's hand as he was adding fuel to the fire. The words ‘fire’ and ‘hand’ are significant in biblical narratives representing both danger and the act of service.|
|ACT 28:4|When the natives saw the creature hanging from his hand, they said to one another, 'Surely this man is a murderer! Though he escaped the sea, Justice has not allowed him to live.'|This translation seeks to capture the essence of the original Greek text while using contemporary language that maintains the theological implications present in the text. The term 'barbarians' reflects the non-Greek inhabitants of the island, while 'justice' is retained to emphasize the notion of divine retribution or fate as understood in the context of the narrative.|
|ACT 28:5|But he shook off the creature into the fire and suffered no harm.|In this verse, the focus is on Paul shaking off the snake and not suffering harm, which emphasizes God's protection and the idea that divine justice prevails. The word 'ὁ μὲν οὖν' signifies a continuation of the narrative and contrast with the previous verse where he was perceived as a murderer. The phrase 'ἀποτινάξας τὸ θηρίον' translates literally as 'having shaken off the beast,' which conveys immediate action in response to a dangerous situation.|
|ACT 28:6|But they were waiting for him to swell up or suddenly fall dead; but after they had waited a long time and saw no harm come to him, they changed their minds and said that he was a god.|In this verse, the expectations of the people shift dramatically after witnessing the events surrounding Paul. Their initial anticipation of harm turns into a belief that he must be a divine figure. The terms for waiting and expecting highlight the uncertainty of their judgement, reflecting a common theme in the Gospels where faith is often revealed in response to miraculous occurrences.|
|ACT 28:7|In the region surrounding that place, there was an estate belonging to Publius, the chief official of the island. He welcomed us and entertained us hospitably for three days.|This verse highlights the hospitality shown by Publius, the chief man of the island, towards Paul and his companions. It reflects the cultural value of hospitality in ancient times, emphasizing the significance of kindness and generosity to travelers.|

Paul went in to him and prayed, and he laid his hands on him and healed him.|This translation emphasizes the act of prayer and the physical act of healing, reflecting the faith and power of Paul as he heals Publius's father. The terms 'fever' and 'dysentery' are kept consistent with medical terminology while being understandable in contemporary English.|
|ACT 28:9|So when this had happened, the rest of those on the island who had diseases came to him and were healed.|This verse emphasizes the miraculous healing ministry of Paul, reflecting the continuation of Jesus' work through His apostles. The phrase 'who had diseases' connects with the widespread need for healing, while the act of approaching signifies faith in the power of healing.|
|ACT 28:10|They also honored us with many honors; and when we departed, they loaded us with supplies for our needs.|The original Greek text emphasizes the honor and gifts that the natives bestowed upon Paul and his companions, reflecting their gratitude and kindness.

|ACT 28:11|After three months, we set sail on an Alexandrian ship that had wintered at the island, adorned with the figurehead of the Dioscuri.|The phrase 'three months' indicates a significant duration of stay, while 'an Alexandrian ship' connects to the broader context of maritime travel in the ancient world. 'Castaways' could imply both literal survival and a metaphorical journey of faith.|
|ACT 28:12|And after landing at Syracuse, we stayed there for three days.|This verse captures the moment of arrival in Syracuse, emphasizing the three days spent there, which was important for the journey of Paul and his companions.

|ACT 28:13|From there we sailed around and arrived at Rhegium. After one day, a gentle south wind began to blow, and the next day we reached Puteoli.|In this translation, the words "we arrived" and "the following day" are emphasized to reflect the sequence of events as the journey continues. The term 'southern winds' is paraphrased to 'gentle south wind' for better flow in English, as it aligns with the nautical theme and the overall narrative of the passage.|

|ACT 28:19|But when the Jews opposed me, I was compelled to appeal to Caesar, not because I had any accusation against my nation.|In this verse, Paul is expressing the necessity of appealing to Caesar due to the opposition from the Jews.

|ACT 28:20|It is for this reason that I have requested to see you and to speak with you; for it is because of the hope of Israel that I am bound with this chain.|In this verse, Paul explains the reason for his appeal to the Jews in Rome.

The emphasis is on his situation being a consequence of the hope of Israel, which he strongly identifies with, linking his imprisonment directly to the hope he proclaims.|
|ACT 28:21|But they said to him, 'We have received no letters concerning you from Judea, nor has any of the brethren come here to report or to speak anything evil about you.'|The verse highlights the lack of written communication regarding Paul from Judea, and the absence of any brothers coming forward with accusations against him. This reflects the uncertainty and misunderstanding surrounding Paul's situation at this point in Acts.|
|ACT 28:22|But we desire to hear from you what your views are; for concerning this sect, we know that everywhere it is spoken against.|This verse reflects the tension surrounding differing beliefs and the apostolic authority in addressing these differences.

|ACT 28:23|And when they had appointed a day for him, many came to him at his lodging; he was explaining to them, testifying about the kingdom of God, and trying to persuade them concerning Jesus from both the Law of Moses and the Prophets, from morning until evening.|In this translation, care was taken to emphasize the preaching of the Kingdom of God, the role of the Law of Moses, and the importance of the prophetic scriptures in revealing Jesus. The phraseology aims to convey the seriousness and dedication of Paul's teaching from dawn until dusk, ensuring clarity and faithfulness to the original text.|
|ACT 28:24|And some were convinced by what he said, while others refused to believe.|In this verse, the contrasting responses to the message of Paul are highlighted: belief and unbelief. The original Greek uses the terms 'ἐπείθοντο' (they were persuaded) and 'ἠπίστουν' (they did not believe), reflecting the duality of reception of the gospel message. This translation aims to capture the essence of the passage while maintaining clarity in English.|
|ACT 28:25|But as they disagreed with one another, they began to depart after Paul had spoken this one word: 'The Holy Spirit rightly spoke through the prophet Isaiah to your fathers, saying...'|This verse reflects the opposition faced by Paul as he speaks to the Jewish leaders. The reference to Isaiah underscores the longstanding issue of spiritual blindness among the people. The use of 'Holy Spirit' aligns with other passages indicating divine communication and revelation. The structure captures the disunity of the audience, emphasizing their inability to reconcile differing opinions about the message Paul delivered.|
|ACT 28:26|Go to this people and say: 'You will hear but not understand, and you will see but not perceive.'|This verse reflects the fulfillment of Isaiah's prophecy regarding the spiritual blindness of the people.
