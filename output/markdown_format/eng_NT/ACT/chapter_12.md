| Reference | Verse | Translation Notes |
|:---------:|-------|-------------------|
|ACT 12:1|About that time, King Herod laid hands on some who belonged to the church, intending to harm them.|The original Greek phrase "ἐπέβαλεν Ἡρῴδης ὁ βασιλεὺς τὰς χεῖρας" indicates an act of persecution initiated by King Herod against certain members of the church. This context reflects the theme of conflict between political powers and the early Christian community. The verb 'ἐπέβαλεν' conveys a forceful action, suggesting Herod's decisive and aggressive measures against those he perceived as threats.|
|ACT 12:2|He executed James the brother of John with the sword.|The term 'ἀνεῖλε' can be understood as 'executed' or 'killed,' and the phrase 'τὸν ἀδελφὸν Ἰωάννου' emphasizes the familial relationship between James and John. The context indicates a brutal act of persecution directed against early Christians.|
|ACT 12:3|And when he saw that it was pleasing to the Jews, he added to seize Peter also. Now it was during the days of Unleavened Bread.|This verse illustrates Herod's political maneuvering to gain favor with the Jewish people by executing Peter, following the execution of James. It is significant to note that this event occurred during the Feast of Unleavened Bread, highlighting the religious context of the time.|
|ACT 12:4|Whom he seized and put in prison, assigning four squads of soldiers to guard him, intending to bring him out to the people after the Passover.|In this verse, the focus is on Peter's imprisonment following his arrest. The term 'four squads of soldiers' indicates a significant military presence, suggesting the seriousness of the situation and the intent to prevent Peter from escaping. The phrase 'after the Passover' emphasizes the timing of the event in relation to Jewish customs.|
|ACT 12:5|So Peter was kept in prison, but earnest prayer for him was made to God by the church.|In this verse, the focus is on the church's fervent prayer for Peter, emphasizing the importance of communal prayer in times of crisis. The Greek word 'ἐκτενὴς' suggests an intensity in their prayers, reflecting deep earnestness. I have chosen to convey this intensity by using 'fervent' in the translation, which is common in biblical contexts when describing earnest prayer.|
|ACT 12:6|When Herod was about to bring him out, that very night Peter was sleeping between two soldiers, bound with two chains; and guards were before the door watching over the prison.|In this verse, the focus is on the imminent execution of Peter, emphasizing his state of sleep in a dire situation, which highlights both his faith and the peace he had. The imagery of being bound between two soldiers with chains underlines the seriousness of his captivity, while the guards at the door signify the intense security measures taken to ensure he does not escape. The phrase 'to lead forth' emphasizes the approaching action from Herod's side.|
|ACT 12:7|And behold, an angel of the Lord stood beside him, and a light shone in the prison. Striking Peter on the side, he awoke him, saying, 'Quickly, arise!' And his chains fell off his hands.|This verse captures the dramatic moment of divine intervention, emphasizing the sudden arrival of the angel and the urgency of Peter's release. The phrase 'arise quickly' denotes immediate action, reflecting the miraculous nature of the event. The mention of chains falling off underscores the liberation and power of God over physical restraints.|
|ACT 12:8|Then the angel said to him, 'Gird yourself and tie on your sandals.' And so he did. And the angel said to him, 'Wrap your cloak around you and follow me.'|In this translation, I aimed to convey the urgency and specific instructions given to Peter by the angel, using simple yet vivid language to maintain clarity and meaning from the original text. The phrases 'gird yourself' and 'put on your sandals' are translated to resonate with contemporary English speakers while preserving the imperative nature of the angel's commands.|
|ACT 12:9|So Peter went out and followed him, not realizing that what was happening through the angel was true; he thought he was seeing a vision.|This verse reflects the uncertainty of Peter as he is led by the angel, mistaking his experience for a vision. The phrase 'he did not realize' highlights his disbelief in the miraculous event. The words 'follow' and 'angel' are significant, connecting this event with divine guidance and the call to discipleship.|
|ACT 12:10|They passed through the first and second guards and came to the iron gate that leads into the city. This gate opened for them of its own accord, and when they had gone out, they went down one street; and immediately the angel departed from them.|In this verse, the description of Peter's escape emphasizes the miraculous nature of the event, including the opening of the iron gate without human intervention. The choice of the word 'opened' reflects divine action and intervention, characteristic of God's work in the early church.|
|ACT 12:11|And when Peter came to himself, he said, "Now I truly know that the Lord has sent His angel and has rescued me from the hand of Herod and from all the expectation of the Jewish people."|This verse emphasizes Peter's realization of divine intervention through the angel sent by the Lord. The phrase 'now I know' reflects a moment of clarity and assurance about God's protection, contrasting with earlier doubts and fears. The reference to Herod signifies the immediate threat that was overcome, while 'the expectations of the people' highlights the societal pressures and danger that Peter faced.|
|ACT 12:12|When he realized this, he went to the house of Mary, the mother of John, whose surname was Mark, where many were gathered together and were praying.|This verse emphasizes the communal prayer life of early Christians, particularly in times of crisis. The terms 'assembled' and 'praying' convey a sense of urgency and unity among believers, reflective of the support and intercession during difficult circumstances.|
|ACT 12:13|And when he knocked at the door of the gateway, a maidservant named Rhoda came to answer.|In this translation, the word 'maidservant' is chosen to reflect the role of the young girl responding to Peter's arrival. The phrase 'approached' is used instead of 'came' to indicate a more deliberate movement towards the door. The name 'Rhoda' is preserved as it appears in the original text to maintain the specificity of the individual mentioned.|
|ACT 12:14|Recognizing Peter's voice, she was so overwhelmed with joy that she did not open the gate; instead, she ran to announce that Peter was standing at the gate.|This verse captures a moment of joy and excitement where Rhoda recognizes Peter's voice but is so overjoyed that she forgets to open the door for him. It highlights the emotional reaction and the urgency of the situation. The phrase 'from joy' emphasizes the overwhelming nature of her happiness, which led to her inaction. The translation seeks to convey the vividness of the scene without deviating from the original meaning.|
|ACT 12:15|They said to her, "You are out of your mind!" But she insisted that it was so. They replied, "It must be his angel."|In this verse, the term 'μαίνῃ' conveys the idea of being out of one’s mind or raving, reflecting disbelief in the situation described. The reference to an 'angel' introduces the supernatural element associated with Peter's escape, suggesting divine intervention, which is consistent with themes in both the Old and New Testaments about angelic beings serving God’s purpose.|
|ACT 12:16|But Peter continued knocking. When they opened the door, they saw him and were astonished.|In this verse, the use of 'knocking' and 'opened' echoes themes of persistence and revelation found in previous scriptures. The response of astonishment ('exestēsan') is pivotal as it reflects the incredulity of the people witnessing the miraculous.|
|ACT 12:17|But motioning to them with his hand to be silent, he described to them how the Lord had brought him out of the prison. And he said, "Go, tell James and the brothers about this." Then he departed and went to another place.|The translation aims to capture the urgency and instruction of Peter's message following his miraculous escape from prison. The phrases 'signaled them to be quiet' and 'told them how the Lord had led him out' reflect Peter's attempt to maintain discretion and emphasize divine intervention. The directive to 'tell James and the brothers' indicates the importance of sharing this news within the early Christian community.|
|ACT 12:18|Now when day had come, there was no small commotion among the soldiers over what had become of Peter.|The phrase 'οὐκ ὀλίγος' is translated as 'not a little,' which conveys a sense of significant disturbance or turmoil among the soldiers. The term 'τάραχος' is best rendered as 'disturbance' or 'commotion' to capture the emotional state of the soldiers. Additionally, 'τί ἄρα' suggests a sense of questioning or wondering about the situation, which I have expressed as 'what then has become of Peter?'|
|ACT 12:19|But Herod, after searching for him and not finding him, questioned the guards and ordered them to be executed. He then went down from Judea to Caesarea and stayed there.|In this verse, Herod is depicted as seeking Peter but finding him missing, leading to the examination of the guards and subsequent orders for their execution. The historical context highlights Herod's ruthless pursuit of power and control. The use of 'ἀνακρίνας' implies a serious interrogation process, emphasizing the desperation of Herod's search.|
|ACT 12:20|Now Herod was angry with the people of Tyre and Sidon; and they came to him with one accord, and having persuaded Blastus, the king's chamberlain, they asked for peace, because their country depended on the king's country for food.|This verse highlights the political maneuvering of Herod as he seeks to maintain power and control over the regions of Tyre and Sidon. The word 'homothumadon' conveys a sense of unity among the people who approached him, which is noteworthy given their contentious relationship with Herod. The mention of Blastus, the king’s chamberlain, emphasizes the influence of intermediaries in securing peace.|
|ACT 12:21|On a designated day, Herod, adorned in royal robes, took his seat on the platform and delivered an oration to the people.|The translation reflects the formal and regal context of Herod's attire, emphasizing the significance of his public address as he assumed a position of authority. The term 'royal garment' denotes not just clothing but the status it confers. 'Seated upon the platform' indicates his elevated position, while 'addressed them' captures the essence of his speech as an authoritative proclamation.|
|ACT 12:22|But the crowd shouted, 'It is the voice of a god, not of a man!'|In this verse, the people's reaction to Herod’s speech suggests a deification of Herod. The phrase 'voice of a god' indicates the extreme reverence and perhaps fear they had towards him.|
|ACT 12:23|Immediately, an angel of the Lord struck him down, because he did not give glory to God. And he was eaten by worms and died.|This translation emphasizes the seriousness of not giving glory to God, as demonstrated by the divine punishment that follows. The terms used here underscore the authority of God and the dire consequences of failing to honor Him appropriately.|
|ACT 12:24|But the word of God continued to grow and flourish.|This verse captures the dynamic growth of God's word and its impact on the community of believers, contrasting sharply with the previous verse that describes the fate of Herod. The language used emphasizes not only the increase in quantity but also the significance of the word of God as a transformative force.|
|ACT 12:25|Then Barnabas and Saul returned from Jerusalem after they had completed their service, bringing with them John, who was called Mark.|In this verse, the focus is on the return of Barnabas and Saul from Jerusalem after fulfilling their ministry, alongside John Mark. The term 'diakonia' is pivotal, often translated as 'ministry' or 'service', indicating their role in serving the church. The fresh translation aims to capture the essence of their mission and collaboration in the ministry.|
