The choice of 'conducted' reflects an ongoing state of living righteously before God up to that point in time.|
|ACT 23:2|But the high priest Ananias commanded those standing by him to strike him on the mouth.|The original Greek text presents a direct action by the high priest Ananias, indicating authority and a confrontational atmosphere.

The language emphasizes the contradiction of judging someone while being guilty of the same faults.
