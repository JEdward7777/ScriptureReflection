The phrase 'many letters' is indicative of Paul's extensive education and scholarly background, which Festus interprets as leading Paul to madness rather than wisdom. The term used for 'speak loudly' reflects the intensity of Festus's reaction to Paul's testimony.|
|ACT 26:25|But he said, "I am not mad, most noble Festus, but I speak words of truth and soundness of mind."|In this verse, Paul is responding to Festus' accusation that he is insane. The use of 'truth' and 'soundness of mind' emphasizes the clarity and reasonableness of his words.
