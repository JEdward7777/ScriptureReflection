|ACT 8:1|On that day, a great persecution arose against the church in Jerusalem; and all except the apostles were scattered throughout the regions of Judea and Samaria.|The phrase 'great persecution' reflects the severity and intensity of the challenges faced by the early Church in Jerusalem. The term 'scattered' suggests a forced dispersal of the believers due to the hostility they encountered, emphasizing the historical context of suffering for their faith. The apostles remaining in Jerusalem signifies their commitment despite the dangers.|
|ACT 8:2|Devout men buried Stephen and made great lamentation over him.|The Greek word 'συνεκόμισαν' implies a formal act of burial or carrying away, while 'κοπετὸν' suggests loud lamentation or mourning, which reflects the cultural practices of grief in Jewish tradition. 'Ευλαβεῖς' indicates the reverence of the men who carried out the burial, highlighting their respect for Stephen as a martyr. This fresh translation maintains fidelity to the original text while incorporating contemporary language for clarity.|
|ACT 8:3|But Saul was wreaking havoc on the church, entering house after house and dragging off men and women, committing them to prison.|The term 'ἐλυμαίνετο' suggests a violent disturbance or ravaging, reflecting Saul's aggressive actions against the church.

The word 'πόλει' (city) emphasizes the community's collective experience of joy.|
|ACT 8:9|But there was a certain man named Simon, who previously practiced magic in the city and amazed the people of Samaria, claiming to be someone great.|This verse introduces Simon, a magician, who had a notable presence in Samaria. The word "magician" (μαγεύων) carries connotations of performing supernatural feats, which is critical for understanding his influence and the cultural context in Samaria, a region known for diverse religious practices. The phrase 'proclaiming himself to be some great one' emphasizes his self-exaltation and deception in the eyes of the people.|
|ACT 8:10|To him all the people gave heed, from the least to the greatest, saying, 'This man is the great power of God.'|The phrase 'the great power of God' is translated to convey Simon's claim about himself and how the people of Samaria perceived him, attributing divine power to his works. The emphasis is on the amazement and belief of the people in Simon's supposed abilities, which stands in contrast to the true power of God as demonstrated later in the chapter.|
|ACT 8:11|And they paid close attention to him for a long time, because he had astonished them with his magic.|The phrase 'they were astonished at his sorceries' reflects the people's amazement and the lengthy period they had been captivated by Simon's magical practices.

|ACT 8:15|Who, after they came down, prayed for them that they might receive the Holy Spirit.|The verse emphasizes the act of prayer for the reception of the Holy Spirit, underscoring the importance of spiritual impartation by the apostles. The verb 'proseuxanto' (they prayed) reflects the earnestness of their intercession on behalf of the Samaritans.|
|ACT 8:16|For the Holy Spirit had not yet fallen upon any of them, they had only been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.|In this verse, the focus is on the fact that the Holy Spirit had not yet descended upon the believers who had only been baptized in the name of Jesus. The use of 'baptized' here emphasizes the initiation into the faith community, while the lack of the Holy Spirit signifies a further need for spiritual empowerment. This highlights the stages of faith experience in the early church, where baptism was essential, but the reception of the Holy Spirit marked a deeper experience.|
|ACT 8:17|Then they laid their hands on them, and they received the Holy Spirit.|This verse emphasizes the act of laying on of hands, a common practice in early Christian communities to convey the Holy Spirit. The phrase 'Holy Spirit' in the original Greek is Πνεῦμα Ἅγιον, which denotes the divine presence of God, actively working in the believers. This reflects the empowerment and initiation into the life of the Spirit following baptism.|
|ACT 8:18|When Simon saw that the Spirit was given through the laying on of the apostles' hands, he offered them money.|This translation captures the essence of Simon's attempt to purchase the ability to confer the Holy Spirit through the laying on of hands, emphasizing the improper desire for spiritual gifts.|
|ACT 8:19|saying, "Give me also this authority, so that anyone on whom I lay my hands may receive the Holy Spirit."|This verse emphasizes the request made by Simon for the power to impart the Holy Spirit through the laying on of hands, which reflects his misunderstanding of the nature of the Holy Spirit and the ministry of the apostles.|
|ACT 8:20|But Peter said to him, 'Let your silver perish with you, because you thought that the gift of God could be purchased with money.'|In this translation, I emphasize the gravity of Peter's condemnation of Simon's attempt to purchase spiritual gifts.

The use of 'loss' rather than 'perdition' conveys the meaning more directly in contemporary English while preserving the original intent.|
|ACT 8:21|You have no share or part in this matter, for your heart is not right before God.|This verse addresses the state of Simon's heart in relation to God, indicating that his intentions are not aligned with God's will.

|ACT 8:22|Therefore, repent from this wickedness of yours, and pray to the Lord that, if possible, the intent of your heart may be forgiven.|This verse is a call to repentance, emphasizing the need to turn away from wickedness and seek God's forgiveness. The original Greek words have been carefully translated to capture the sense of regret and a sincere plea to God for cleansing.|
|ACT 8:23|For I see that you are in the gall of bitterness and the bond of iniquity.|In this verse, the terms 'bitterness' and 'bond of iniquity' reflect the serious spiritual condition of the individual being addressed. The phrase 'bitterness' is often associated with deep-seated resentment, while 'bond of iniquity' signifies a strong hold or connection to sin. The translation captures the severity of Peter's assessment of Simon's heart condition.|
|ACT 8:24|Then Simon answered, "Pray to the Lord for me, so that nothing of what you have said may come upon me."|In this verse, Simon the magician recognizes the seriousness of his situation and seeks the intercession of the apostles, acknowledging their relationship with God. This highlights the theme of prayer and the importance of community support in addressing spiritual issues.|

'Εὐηγγελίσαντο' refers specifically to the act of evangelizing, which is central to the mission of the early apostles. 'Κώμας' is used here to indicate the smaller towns or villages, showing that their ministry extended beyond just the major cities.|
|ACT 8:26|But an angel of the Lord spoke to Philip, saying, 'Rise and go toward the south, to the road that goes down from Jerusalem to Gaza.' This is a desolate place.|This verse marks the beginning of Philip's important mission to the Ethiopian eunuch, highlighting divine instruction and the role of the angel of the Lord. The term 'desert' signifies a solitary or unpopulated place, pointing to the unique environment of this calling.|
|ACT 8:27|So he arose and went; and behold, there was an Ethiopian man, a eunuch of great authority under Candace, the queen of the Ethiopians, who was in charge of all her treasury, and had come to Jerusalem to worship.|In this translation, the phrase 'a man of Ethiopia' refers to an important official from the region of Ethiopia, emphasizing his status as a eunuch and the specific context of his journey to Jerusalem for worship.

|ACT 8:29|Then the Spirit said to Philip, 'Go up and join this chariot.'|The phrase 'πρόσελθε καὶ κολλήθητι' conveys a sense of urgency and instruction, implying both movement towards and a close association with the chariot. This translation seeks to capture that sense of divine direction given to Philip by the Spirit.|
|ACT 8:30|So Philip ran up to the chariot and heard the man reading the prophet Isaiah. He asked him, 'Do you understand what you are reading?'|The verse highlights Philip's proactive engagement with the Ethiopian eunuch as he reads from the prophet Isaiah. It underscores the importance of understanding Scripture and Philip's role in facilitating this understanding.|
|ACT 8:31|He replied, 'How can I understand unless someone guides me?' And he invited Philip to come up and sit with him.|In this translation, I focused on the themes of guidance and the need for someone to help understand the Scriptures. The use of the word 'guide' reflects the role of Philip as a teacher and mentor.|
|ACT 8:32|The passage of Scripture that he was reading was this: 'Like a sheep, he was led to the slaughter; and like a lamb before its shearer, he remains silent; so he does not open his mouth.'|This verse reflects the profound silence and submissiveness of the sacrificial lamb, emphasizing the humility and obedience of Christ, as seen in various prophetic scriptures, particularly Isaiah 53. The imagery evokes the deep themes of sacrifice and atonement.|
|ACT 8:33|In his humiliation, justice was denied him; who can recount his lineage?

The translation captures the gravity of the speaker’s situation as well as the questions raised about legacy and recognition.|
|ACT 8:34|The eunuch answered Philip, 'I ask you, about whom does the prophet say this?

This highlights the need for revelation and guidance in understanding scripture, particularly in light of its fulfillment in Christ.|
|ACT 8:35|Then Philip opened his mouth, and beginning from that Scripture, he preached the good news about Jesus to him.|In this verse, Philip opens his mouth to explain the Scriptures to the eunuch, emphasizing the importance of the Word of God in revealing Christ.
