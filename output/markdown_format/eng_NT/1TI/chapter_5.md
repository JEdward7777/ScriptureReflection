| Reference | Verse | Translation Notes |
|:---------:|-------|-------------------|
|1TI 5:1|Do not harshly rebuke an older man, but appeal to him as you would to a father; treat younger men as brothers.|In this verse, Paul advises Timothy on how to interact with older and younger men in the church. The choice of words emphasizes respect and familial love, highlighting the Christian principle of treating others with dignity regardless of their age. The directive to encourage rather than rebuke is vital for fostering a spirit of unity and respect within the body of Christ.|
|1TI 5:2|Treat older women as mothers, and younger women as sisters, with all purity.|This verse emphasizes the familial relationships among believers, urging a respectful and pure treatment of older women as mothers and younger women as sisters. The word 'purity' highlights the importance of moral integrity in these relationships.|
|1TI 5:3|Honor widows who are truly in need.|In this verse, the term 'widows' refers to women who have lost their husbands and are in need of support and honor from the community. The phrasing 'honor the widows' emphasizes the importance of acknowledging their status and providing for their needs, distinguishing between those who genuinely require assistance and those who do not.|
|1TI 5:4|But if a widow has children or grandchildren, they must learn first to show piety at home and to repay their parents, for this is pleasing in the sight of God.|This verse emphasizes the importance of care and respect for one’s family, particularly regarding widows with children. The term 'οἶκον' (household) indicates a focus on familial responsibilities, while 'εὐσεβεῖν' reflects a piety that extends to honoring one’s ancestors.|
|1TI 5:5|But she who is truly a widow, having set her hope on God, continues in prayers and supplications night and day.|This translation reflects the emphasis on the true state of a widow who is devoted to God and constantly in prayer, contrasting her situation with those who have family support. The original Greek terms suggest a deep reliance on God and a lifestyle of continual prayer.|
|1TI 5:6|But she who lives for pleasure is dead even while she lives.|The original Greek phrase conveys a sense of a person living indulgently or wastefully, disconnected from spiritual realities. In this translation, I have aimed to capture the gravity of such a lifestyle contrasted with the value of spiritual pursuits.|
|1TI 5:7|And command these things so that they may be without blame.|The phrase 'ἀνεπίληπτοι ὦσιν' conveys the idea of being blameless or without reproach. This translation emphasizes the importance of living in accordance with one's faith and responsibilities, particularly in the context of caring for those in need, which is consistent with the surrounding verses.|
|1TI 5:8|But if anyone does not take care of his own, especially those of his household, he has denied the faith and is worse than an unbeliever.|This verse emphasizes the importance of providing for one's own family, connecting it to faithfulness. The terms used relate to caring for immediate relatives and highlight the moral implications of neglecting such responsibilities.|
|1TI 5:9|Let no widow be enrolled unless she is not less than sixty years old, the wife of one husband.|In this verse, the qualification of a widow is being established, specifically regarding age and marital status. The phrase 'of sixty years or more' emphasizes a certain standard for those being considered for support in the church. The term 'wife of one husband' is also significant as it speaks to her fidelity in marriage, which is a key attribute in Christian community values.|
|1TI 5:10|having a reputation for good works: if she has brought up children, shown hospitality, washed the feet of the saints, assisted those in distress, and devoted herself to every good work.|This verse highlights the various acts of service that a widow must have engaged in to be considered worthy of enrollment. The original Greek words indicate a pattern of good deeds reflecting the character of Christ's love and service to others.|
|1TI 5:11|But refuse to enroll younger widows; for when they become senseless in their desires for Christ, they wish to marry.|In this verse, Paul addresses the specific behavior expected of younger widows, warning against the temptation to remarry too quickly, especially if it leads them away from faithfulness to Christ. The verb 'to desire' (θέλουσιν) implies a strong inclination towards remarriage that Paul sees as potentially compromising their commitment to Christ. This context emphasizes the importance of making wise spiritual choices in light of one's commitments.|
|1TI 5:12|They incur judgment because they have rejected their former faith.|This verse reflects a serious concern regarding the faithfulness of widows in the church. It indicates that those who have 'rejected the first faith' (or initial commitment to Christ) will face judgment. The term 'krīma' denotes a sense of judgment or condemnation, highlighting the importance of maintaining one's faith. The choice of words emphasizes the consequences of turning away from one's initial commitment to faith in Christ.|
|1TI 5:13|And besides, they learn to be idle, going about from house to house; and not only are they idle, but also gossips and busybodies, saying things which they ought not.|This verse warns against the behaviors of idleness and meddling in affairs that do not concern one, echoing themes of wisdom and the dangers of speaking unnecessarily.|
|1TI 5:14|Therefore, I desire that the younger widows marry, bear children, and manage their households, giving no opportunity to the adversary for slander.|In this verse, the apostle Paul encourages younger widows to marry, bear children, and manage their homes. The term 'younger' emphasizes a specific age group, while the call to marry and have children is rooted in cultural and biblical values surrounding family life. The phrase 'not giving any occasion for the adversary to speak reproachfully' highlights the importance of maintaining a good reputation in the community, particularly in the face of slander or gossip. The translation aims to maintain the essence of the original Greek text while making it accessible for contemporary readers.|
|1TI 5:15|For some have already turned aside to follow Satan.|This verse warns against the danger of turning away from faith and highlights the spiritual conflict represented by 'Satan'. The term 'turned away' suggests a deliberate act of apostasy, and 'Satan' signifies the ultimate adversary in the Christian worldview. The phrasing aims to retain the original meaning while making it accessible in contemporary English.|
|1TI 5:16|If any believing woman has relatives who are widows, let her assist them, and do not let the church be burdened, so that it may assist those widows who are truly in need.|In this verse, the emphasis is placed on the church's responsibility towards widows. The term 'πιστός' (faithful) and 'χύρας' (widows) are crucial as they indicate both the character of the believers providing help and the specific demographic being addressed. The translation seeks to clarify that the church should not bear the burden of supporting those who have family capable of assistance, ensuring that aid is directed to those in genuine need.|
|1TI 5:17|Let the elders who lead well be considered worthy of double honor, especially those who labor in preaching and teaching.|The term 'double honor' indicates both respect and financial support, especially for those who lead effectively and engage in teaching. This emphasizes the importance of honoring spiritual leaders who contribute significantly to the church through preaching and teaching.|
|1TI 5:18|For the Scripture says, 'You shall not muzzle an ox while it is treading out the grain,' and, 'The laborer is worthy of his wages.'|The phrase 'the laborer deserves his wages' reflects the concept of merit for work done, which is a common biblical theme. The expression 'muzzle an ox' from Deuteronomy emphasizes the importance of allowing workers to benefit from their labor. This verse underscores the right of those who work in ministry to receive compensation.|
|1TI 5:19|Do not accept an accusation against an elder unless it is confirmed by two or three witnesses.|This verse emphasizes the necessity of multiple witnesses when bringing a charge against an elder. This aligns with Jewish law and principles of justice that require corroboration to protect the reputation of leaders within the church.|
|1TI 5:20|Rebuke those who persist in sin before everyone, so that the rest may take warning.|In this verse, the emphasis is on holding accountable those who are in leadership positions within the church when they sin. The act of rebuking in front of others serves as a serious warning to both the offender and the rest of the community. The term 'rebuke' carries with it the sense of correction intended to restore and instill reverence in the others observing the process. The fresh translation aims to maintain clarity while reflecting the weight of this responsibility.|
|1TI 5:21|I solemnly charge you before God and Christ Jesus and the chosen angels, to keep these instructions without bias, doing nothing out of favoritism.|This verse emphasizes the solemn responsibility of Timothy, invoking the authority of God and Christ, as well as the chosen angels. It highlights the need for impartiality in judgment and the adherence to divine principles without favoritism. The term 'charge' suggests a strong imperative, reinforcing the seriousness of the directive given to Timothy.|
|1TI 5:22|Do not hastily lay hands on anyone, nor partake in the sins of others; keep yourself pure.|In this verse, Paul is instructing Timothy to exercise caution in the ordination of leaders and not to hastily confer authority through the laying on of hands. This reflects the seriousness of church leadership and the importance of maintaining personal integrity amidst communal responsibilities.|
|1TI 5:23|Do not continue drinking only water, but use a little wine for the sake of your stomach and your frequent ailments.|This verse addresses the physical and health-related needs of Timothy, providing practical advice for his well-being. The instruction not to drink only water, but to use a little wine, suggests moderation and the medicinal use of wine, particularly for stomach issues and frequent ailments, in line with ancient understanding of health.|
|1TI 5:24|The sins of some people are clearly evident, leading them to judgment; while others follow after.|In this verse, the contrast between visible and hidden sins is highlighted. The original Greek suggests that some sins are evident and lead to immediate judgment, while others may not be immediately apparent but will ultimately follow the individual. The idea of judgment and accountability for actions is central to the message.|
|1TI 5:25|Likewise, good works are clearly evident, and those that are not cannot remain hidden.|The original text highlights the visibility and inevitability of good works, akin to the clear manifestation of sins mentioned in the previous verse. The term 'good works' refers to deeds that are beneficial and align with Christian teachings. The translation seeks to preserve the contrast between visible good and hidden evil actions.|
