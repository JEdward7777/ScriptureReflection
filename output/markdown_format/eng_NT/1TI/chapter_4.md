| Reference | Verse | Translation Notes |
|:---------:|-------|-------------------|
|1TI 4:1|Now the Spirit explicitly states that in the later times, some will renounce the faith and pay attention to deceitful spirits and the teachings of demons.|In this verse, the focus is on the latter times when certain individuals will turn away from the faith. The terms used, such as 'spirit' and 'teachings of demons', highlight the presence of deceptive influences that lead people astray from sound doctrine. The term 'apostasy' reflects a serious spiritual decline, emphasizing the urgency of vigilance in faith.|
|1TI 4:2|through the hypocrisy of liars whose consciences have been seared as with a hot iron.|In this translation, I focused on the terms 'hypocrisy' and 'seared conscience,' aiming for clarity while maintaining the original meaning of the text. The term 'seared' (κεκαυστηριασμένων) conveys a strong image of something that has lost sensitivity, which is critical in understanding the nature of the individuals described.|
|1TI 4:3|They forbid marriage and advocate abstaining from certain foods, which God created to be received with thanksgiving by those who believe and know the truth.|In this verse, the Apostle Paul addresses false teachings that prohibit marriage and dietary practices that God has created for believers. The terms 'forbidding to marry' and 'abstaining from certain foods' reflect a misunderstanding of God's creation and His intent for His followers. The use of 'faithful' and 'knowing the truth' emphasizes the community of believers who understand the gospel and the good gifts from God. The phrase 'with thanksgiving' underscores the attitude believers should have toward God's provisions, in contrast to ascetic practices.|
|1TI 4:4|For every creation of God is good, and nothing is to be rejected if it is received with thanksgiving.|This translation aims to capture the essence of Paul's teaching about the goodness of God's creation and the importance of gratitude in receiving it. The original Greek uses strong language about God's creation, emphasizing its inherent goodness and the appropriate response of thanksgiving.|
|1TI 4:5|For it is sanctified by the word of God and by prayer.|The phrase 'διὰ λόγου Θεοῦ καὶ ἐντεύξεως' conveys the idea that everything is sanctified through God's Word and prayer. This highlights the importance of both divine revelation (God's Word) and human response (prayer) in the process of sanctification.|
|1TI 4:6|If you instruct the brothers in these things, you will be a good servant of Jesus Christ, nourished in the words of faith and of the good teaching that you have closely followed.|This verse emphasizes the role of a deacon in the church, underscoring the importance of teaching sound doctrine and remaining grounded in faith. The phrase 'good servant of Jesus Christ' highlights the servanthood of the leader in the faith community. The 'words of faith' and 'good teaching' mentioned are central to spiritual nourishment.|
|1TI 4:7|But reject irreverent and old wives' tales; rather, train yourself for godliness.|In this verse, Paul urges Timothy to reject unwholesome myths and to train himself towards godliness. The use of 'exercise' metaphorically points to the rigorous discipline needed for spiritual growth, akin to physical training.|
|1TI 4:8|For physical training is of limited value, but godliness is beneficial in every way, holding promise for the present life and for the life to come.|This verse contrasts physical training with spiritual training, emphasizing the superior value of godliness which has benefits for both the present life and the life to come. The phrase 'physical training' is understood as beneficial but limited, while 'godliness' offers a comprehensive benefit, referencing both present and future life. This duality captures the essence of Christian hope and practical living.|
|1TI 4:9|This saying is trustworthy and deserves full acceptance.|This verse emphasizes the trustworthiness of certain sayings or truths in Christian doctrine. The phrase 'πιστὸς ὁ λόγος' translates to 'faithful is the saying' or 'trustworthy is the word,' indicating a high level of reliability in the teachings being conveyed.|
|1TI 4:10|For this reason, we strive and are insulted, because we have placed our hope in the living God, who is the Savior of all people, especially of those who believe.|The translation emphasizes the labor and the hope placed in the living God, who is characterized as the Savior of all, with a particular note on believers. The choice of words like 'labor' and 'hope' reflect the Greek terms used, while 'Savior' captures the essence of σωτήρ in this context.|
|1TI 4:11|Command and teach these things.|In this verse, the imperative mood is used to convey a sense of urgency and authority in the command to instruct and teach. The term 'command' (παράγγελλε) carries the weight of a directive that should not be taken lightly, suggesting both leadership and responsibility. This reflects the pastoral role of Timothy as a young leader in the church.|
|1TI 4:12|Let no one despise your youth, but be an example to the believers in word, in conduct, in love, in spirit, in faith, in purity.|This verse encourages young Timothy to be a model for believers in various aspects of life, emphasizing the importance of character and conduct. The call to be an example ('τύπος') suggests not only moral integrity but also the necessity of active leadership through personal influence.|
|1TI 4:13|Until I arrive, devote yourself to the public reading of Scripture, to exhortation, to teaching.|In this verse, Paul emphasizes the importance of diligent attention to the public reading of Scripture, encouragement, and sound teaching. The terms used here highlight the roles of teaching and community in the growth of faith.|
|1TI 4:14|Do not neglect the spiritual gift that is in you, which was given to you through prophecy when the elders laid their hands on you.|In this verse, Paul urges Timothy not to neglect the spiritual gift he received, emphasizing the importance of using one's gifts in ministry. The mention of prophecy and the laying on of hands indicates a formal recognition and commissioning by church leaders. The choice of 'gift' here captures the idea of a divinely bestowed ability meant for service.|
|1TI 4:15|Practice these things; be diligent in them, so that your progress may be evident to all.|The phrase 'these things' refers to the teachings and responsibilities outlined in the previous verses. The exhortation to 'practice' and 'be diligent' underscores the importance of active engagement in one's spiritual life, as it directly impacts the visibility of one's growth and progress to others.|
|1TI 4:16|Pay careful attention to yourself and to your teaching; persist in this, for by doing so you will save both yourself and those who hear you.|In this verse, the imperative to pay close attention to oneself and to teaching underscores the importance of self-examination and adherence to sound doctrine. The phrase 'saving both yourself and your hearers' reflects the interconnectedness of personal faithfulness and the impact it has on others. This aligns with the overarching theme of Timothy's role as a leader in the church.|
