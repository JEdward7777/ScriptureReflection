| Reference | Verse | Translation Notes |
|:---------:|-------|-------------------|
|1TI 3:1|This is a trustworthy saying: If anyone aspires to the office of overseer, he desires a noble task.|This verse emphasizes the noble aspiration of seeking the role of an overseer (bishop) and the high calling associated with it. The phrase 'trustworthy saying' indicates that the following statement is of significant importance and reliability within the Christian community.|
|1TI 3:2|Therefore, an overseer must be above reproach, the husband of one wife, sober-minded, self-controlled, respectable, hospitable, and able to teach.|The term 'overseer' is a critical designation for church leaders, reflecting both responsibility and authority within the Christian community. The phrase 'husband of one wife' emphasizes fidelity and commitment, which are essential traits for leaders in the church. Words such as 'sober-minded,' 'self-controlled,' 'respectable,' 'hospitable,' and 'able to teach' paint a comprehensive picture of a qualified leader's character and capabilities. This translation aims to maintain the integrity of the original Greek while providing clarity in modern English.|
|1TI 3:3|He must not be a drunkard, nor violent, nor greedy for dishonest gain, but gentle, peaceable, not a lover of money.|The verse emphasizes the moral and ethical qualities expected of a leader within the church, contrasting negative traits with positive virtues. It focuses on self-control, gentleness, and an absence of greed, aligning with the character of Christ.|
|1TI 3:4|He must manage his own household well, with children who respect and obey him in all dignity.|In this verse, the focus is on the qualification of a church leader, particularly emphasizing the importance of managing one's household well. The phrase 'καλῶς προϊστάμενον' translates to 'managing well', reflecting the leadership and care expected from one who serves in a position of authority. The word 'τέκνα' refers to 'children', highlighting the need for their respectful submission, while 'ὑποταγῇ' indicates the idea of obedience and order within the family context. This underscores the connection between spiritual leadership and family responsibility.|
|1TI 3:5|For if someone does not know how to manage his own household, how will he care for the church of God?|This verse emphasizes the importance of a leader's ability to manage their own household, reflecting on their capability to care for the broader community of believers. The implication is that if one cannot lead their own family effectively, they will struggle to lead the church.|
|1TI 3:6|He must not be a recent convert, or he may become conceited and fall into the condemnation of the devil.|The term 'νεόφυτον' (neophyte) refers to someone new or recently converted. In this context, it warns against placing a novice in a position of authority, highlighting the potential spiritual dangers that arise from a lack of maturity. The phrase 'τυφωθεὶς εἰς κρῖμα ἐμπέσῃ τοῦ διαβόλου' (becoming puffed up and falling into condemnation) implies that pride can lead to downfall, particularly the kind that results from arrogance in spiritual matters. Thus, the translation maintains the original Greek nuances of caution against spiritual naivety and pride.|
|1TI 3:7|Moreover, he must have a good testimony from those outside the church, so that he will not fall into reproach and the snare of the devil.|This verse emphasizes the importance of having a good reputation among outsiders. The term 'marturia' (testimony) here indicates the significance of a good witness in the community, essential for an elder's role in the church. The phrase 'fall into reproach' implies that a lack of good testimony can lead to disgrace, particularly regarding spiritual leadership, which can ultimately be a snare of the devil.|
|1TI 3:8|Likewise, deacons must be dignified, not double-tongued, not indulging in much wine, not greedy for dishonest gain.|The term 'deacons' refers to those who serve within the church, and their character is of utmost importance. The word 'serious' reflects a need for dignity and respect, while 'not double-tongued' emphasizes honesty and integrity in speech. The prohibition against excessive drinking suggests moderation and self-control, and 'not greedy for dishonest gain' indicates a rejection of financial misconduct.|
|1TI 3:9|Holding to the mystery of the faith with a pure conscience.|In this verse, the phrase 'mystery of the faith' implies the deeper truths of Christian faith, while 'pure conscience' denotes integrity and moral clarity in one's beliefs and actions. This translation seeks to reflect both the depth of the faith and the moral character expected of church leaders.|
|1TI 3:10|And let them first be tested; then let them serve as deacons if they are found blameless.|The original Greek text emphasizes the importance of testing or examining those who are to serve in ministry roles. The use of the word 'ἀνέγκλητοι' implies a standard of blamelessness that is crucial for those in leadership positions in the church. This translation aims to preserve the intent and the gravity of the qualifications set for deacons as leaders in the Christian community.|
|1TI 3:11|In the same way, women must be dignified, not slanderers, sober-minded, faithful in all things.|This verse highlights the characteristics expected of women who serve alongside the deacons. The use of 'semenas' suggests dignity and seriousness, 'not slanderers' refers to a prohibition against malicious gossip, 'sober' indicates a call for self-control, and 'faithful in all things' emphasizes reliability and integrity in their conduct.|
|1TI 3:12|Let deacons be the husbands of one wife, managing their children and their own households well.|This verse emphasizes the qualities and responsibilities expected of deacons in the church, particularly regarding their family life and integrity. The original Greek implies a one-woman man, underscoring fidelity and responsibility within the household.|
|1TI 3:13|For those who have served well as deacons acquire a good standing for themselves and great confidence in the faith that is in Christ Jesus.|The Greek word 'διακονήσαντες' translates to 'having served well', which implies diligence and faithfulness in service. The phrase 'καλὸν βαθμὸν περιποιοῦνται' suggests that by serving well, they attain a good standing or status in their ministry. The term 'παρρησίαν ἐν πίστει' emphasizes the boldness and confidence that comes from faith in Christ Jesus, highlighting the spiritual authority and credibility gained through faithful service.|

|1TI 3:15|If I delay, you may know how one ought to conduct themselves in the household of God, which is the church of the living God, a pillar and foundation of the truth.|This translation emphasizes the structure and significance of the Church as the living house of God, which stands firm in the truth.|
|1TI 3:16|And undeniably, great is the mystery of godliness: He was revealed in the flesh, justified in the Spirit, seen by angels, proclaimed among the nations, believed on in the world, taken up in glory.|This verse encapsulates the essence of the mystery of godliness, highlighting the revelation of God through Christ in various stages of His ministry and existence. Each clause reflects key aspects of Christ’s incarnation, justification, manifestation, proclamation, belief, and glorification.|
