|:---------:|-------|-------------------|
|1TI 6:1|Let all who are under the yoke as servants regard their own masters as worthy of all honor, so that the name of God and the teaching may not be reviled.|This verse emphasizes the attitude servants should have towards their masters, encouraging respect and honor towards those in authority. The focus is on avoiding actions that could bring dishonor to God and the teaching of Christ.|
|1TI 6:2|But those who have believing masters should not be disrespectful because they are brothers; rather, they should serve all the more, since those who benefit by their good service are believers and beloved.|In this verse, the apostle Paul encourages those who are in servitude to regard their Christian masters with respect, acknowledging their shared faith. The instruction emphasizes a spirit of service rather than disdain, highlighting the Christian bond of brotherhood. The term 'believers' (πιστοὺς) refers specifically to fellow Christians, emphasizing the importance of mutual respect in the community of faith.|
|1TI 6:3|Teach and encourage these things. If anyone advocates a different doctrine and does not agree with the sound words of our Lord Jesus Christ and the teaching that accords with godliness,|This translation seeks to emphasize the importance of teaching sound doctrine and the need to reject false teachings that deviate from the core tenets of faith as taught by Jesus Christ. The phrase 'healthy words' is used to reflect the original text's intention of promoting spiritual health through proper teaching.|

The Greek term 'τετύφωται' suggests being blinded or deluded, which is used to describe those who do not have true knowledge of God’s word. The words 'ζητήσεις' (questions) and 'λογομαχίας' (debates) highlight the contentious nature of their discussions, leading to negative outcomes like envy and strife.|
|1TI 6:5|and constant friction among people who are depraved in mind and deprived of the truth, imagining that godliness is a means of gain. Withdraw yourself from such.|The original Greek phrases reflect the concept of those whose minds have been corrupted and who lack the truth. The phrase suggests that they mistake piety for a means of financial gain, leading to false teaching and division within the community. The translation focuses on conveying these ideas clearly and concisely, maintaining the seriousness of the admonition.|
|1TI 6:6|But godliness with contentment is great gain.|In this verse, the Apostle Paul emphasizes the value of godliness combined with contentment. The term 'godliness' reflects a devout lifestyle that is pleasing to God, while 'contentment' implies self-sufficiency and satisfaction with what one has, contrasting sharply with a desire for wealth and material gain.|
|1TI 6:7|For we brought nothing into the world, and it is clear that we cannot take anything out of it.|This verse emphasizes the transient nature of material possessions and the inability to bring anything from this life into the next. The focus is on the futility of accumulating wealth and the importance of contentment with what one has, aligning with the teachings of Christ about treasures in heaven.|
|1TI 6:8|But if we have food and clothing, with these we will be content.|The phrase 'ἔχοντες δὲ διατροφὰς καὶ σκεπάσματα' refers to basic needs—food and clothing. The emphasis is on contentment with these essentials, aligning with the broader biblical theme of trust in God's provision. The translation aims to capture the simplicity and directness of the original Greek, stressing the idea of sufficiency in what one possesses.|

The Greek words for 'temptation', 'trap', 'foolish desires', and 'harmful' emphasize the serious consequences of this pursuit.|
|1TI 6:10|For the love of money is a root of all kinds of evil, from which some, aspiring to it, have wandered away from the faith and pierced themselves through with many sorrows.|The verse emphasizes the dangers of the love of money, not merely the possession of wealth but the craving for it that leads to moral and spiritual downfall. The term 'filargyria' reflects a strong attachment to money, illustrating its perilous nature. The phrase 'many sorrows' indicates the profound regret and pain that often accompany the pursuit of wealth.|
|1TI 6:11|But you, O man of God, flee these things; and pursue righteousness, godliness, faith, love, endurance, and gentleness.|In this verse, Paul instructs Timothy on the virtues to pursue as a man of God, emphasizing both moral integrity and personal character. The choice of 'flee' indicates an urgent need to avoid negative influences, while 'pursue' suggests a proactive effort in cultivating spiritual qualities.|
|1TI 6:12|Strive for the good fight of faith; seize the eternal life to which you were called and for which you made the good confession in the presence of many witnesses.|The phrase 'fight the good fight of faith' captures both the struggle and the nobility of the believer's journey. 'Take hold of eternal life' emphasizes an active, engaged pursuit of the eternal calling. The term 'good confession' aligns with a believer's declaration of faith before witnesses, signifying integrity and boldness in testimony.|
|1TI 6:13|I charge you in the sight of God, who gives life to all things, and of Christ Jesus, who made the good confession before Pontius Pilate.|In this verse, Paul emphasizes the seriousness of Timothy's calling and the weight of the responsibility he carries, reminding him of the divine witness to his mission. The phrase 'in the presence of God' denotes the sacredness of this charge, while referencing Jesus' testimony before Pilate reinforces the theme of standing firm in one's convictions amidst trials.|
|1TI 6:14|to keep the commandment unstained and without reproach until the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ,|In this verse, the emphasis is on keeping the commandment 'unstained' and 'irreproachable' until the return of the Lord Jesus Christ. The words chosen reflect a call to purity and faithfulness in one's Christian walk, highlighting the importance of adhering to God's commands without blemish.|
|1TI 6:15|which He will display at the proper time, He who is the blessed and only Sovereign, the King of kings and Lord of lords.|The Greek text emphasizes the singular authority and the divine nature of Christ as the ultimate ruler. The terms used here connect Jesus to both a temporal and eternal reign, indicating His supremacy over all powers.|
|1TI 6:16|He alone possesses immortality, dwelling in unapproachable light, whom no man has seen or can see. To Him be honor and eternal dominion. Amen.|This verse emphasizes the unique attributes of God as the sole possessor of immortality and the essence of light, which is both metaphorical and literal in its implications of purity and holiness. The use of 'unapproachable light' underscores God's majesty and the inability of humanity to fully comprehend or behold His essence.|
|1TI 6:17|Instruct those who are wealthy in this present age not to be proud or to set their hope on the uncertainty of riches, but on God, who richly provides us with all things to enjoy.|This verse addresses the wealthy, warning them against pride and misplaced hope in uncertain riches. It emphasizes reliance on the living God, who generously provides for our enjoyment. The choice of the term 'high-minded' conveys the danger of arrogance that can come with wealth, while 'uncertain riches' points to the transient nature of material wealth. 'The living God' is highlighted to contrast the reliability of God with the fragility of earthly treasures.|
|1TI 6:18|Instruct them to do good, to be rich in good works, to be generous and ready to share.|This verse emphasizes the actions expected of the wealthy in doing good, being generous, and fostering community among believers. It connects with the previous verse’s theme of reliance on God rather than wealth.|
|1TI 6:19|Storing up for themselves a good foundation for the future, so that they may take hold of the eternal life.|The original Greek phrase 'ἀποθησαυρίζοντας ἑαυτοῖς θεμέλιον καλὸν εἰς τὸ μέλλον' can be interpreted as 'storing up for themselves a good foundation for the future.' This highlights the idea of preparing oneself spiritually and morally for eternal life. The phrase 'ἐπιλάβωνται τῆς αἰωνίου ζωῆς' directly translates to 'that they may take hold of eternal life,' emphasizing the active engagement in the Christian faith and the hope of salvation.|
|1TI 6:20|O Timothy, guard the deposit entrusted to you, avoiding the irreverent babble and contradictions of what is falsely called knowledge.|In this verse, Paul emphasizes the importance of guarding the precious teachings entrusted to Timothy. The terms used suggest the need for vigilance against false teachings and the significance of holding on to the truth of the Gospel.|
|1TI 6:21|which some have professed and thereby wandered away from the faith. Grace be with you. Amen.|In this verse, the emphasis is on the importance of faith and the warning against false teachings that lead one astray.
