|:---------:|-------|-------------------|
|1TI 1:1|Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the command of God our Savior and of Christ Jesus our hope.|This verse establishes Paul’s authority as an apostle through divine command. It emphasizes the role of God as Savior and Christ as the source of hope. The use of 'apostle' is significant in asserting Paul's commissioned role in spreading the Gospel, and the phrase 'according to the command of God' denotes the divine origin of his mission.|
|1TI 1:2|To Timothy, my true child in the faith: Grace, mercy, and peace from God our Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.|The phrase 'genuine child in faith' captures Timothy's authentic relationship with Paul and the faith they share. The Greek terms for grace, mercy, and peace highlight the blessings that come from a close relationship with God and Christ, which is fitting given the pastoral context of this epistle.|
|1TI 1:3|As I urged you to remain in Ephesus when I was heading to Macedonia, so that you may command certain individuals not to teach any different doctrine.|In this translation, emphasis is placed on Paul's exhortation to Timothy to remain in Ephesus to ensure sound doctrine is upheld. The terms used in this verse align closely with Paul's larger emphasis on teaching and doctrine throughout the pastoral epistles.|
|1TI 1:4|nor to pay attention to myths and endless genealogies, which give rise to questions rather than the stewardship of God that is by faith.|In this verse, Paul cautions Timothy against engaging in endless myths and genealogies, which distract from God's purpose and lead to fruitless debates. The term 'endless' emphasizes the futility of such pursuits, contrasting them with the true aim of promoting God's stewardship through faith.|
|1TI 1:5|But the goal of our instruction is love that comes from a pure heart, a good conscience, and sincere faith.|The phrase 'the end of the commandment' emphasizes the ultimate goal or purpose behind the instruction given. The term 'love' is derived from the Greek 'ἀγάπη' (agape), which denotes a selfless, unconditional love that fulfills God’s commandments. 'Pure heart' reflects sincerity and moral purity, while 'good conscience' indicates a state of moral integrity, and 'unfeigned faith' suggests a genuine and authentic belief.|
|1TI 1:6|Some, having strayed from these things, have turned aside to meaningless discussions.|The term 'ματαιολογίαν' translates to 'empty talk' or 'meaningless discussion', indicating a deviation from sound teaching that is filled with vanity or futility. This highlights the seriousness of straying from true doctrine, as it leads to unproductive and hollow arguments.|
|1TI 1:7|Desiring to be teachers of the law, but not understanding either what they say or the subjects they confidently affirm.|In this verse, the term 'teachers of the law' reflects those who desire to instruct others in the Jewish Law. However, the phrase 'not understanding either what they say or the matters about which they make confident assertions' indicates a lack of genuine knowledge and comprehension, leading to the danger of misguided teaching. This translation aims to capture the seriousness of their misunderstanding and the implications for their role as teachers.|
|1TI 1:8|We know that the law is good if one uses it properly.|This verse emphasizes the goodness of the law when applied correctly. The phrase 'when used lawfully' highlights that understanding and correct application are crucial. It contrasts with the misuse or misunderstanding of the law by some, which has been the focus in the previous verse.|

The terms used for the unrighteous reflect their disobedience and moral failures.|
|1TI 1:10|for those who are sexually immoral, practicing homosexuality, enslavers, liars, perjurers, and whatever else is contrary to sound teaching.|This verse addresses specific immoral behaviors and individuals that contradict sound doctrine. The terms used here highlight various forms of moral corruption and deception, consistent with the themes of righteous living in the surrounding context. The translation seeks to preserve the gravity of the original Greek terms while clarifying their meanings for contemporary readers.|
|1TI 1:11|in accordance with the glorious gospel of the blessed God, with which I have been entrusted.|The phrase 'the glorious gospel of the blessed God' emphasizes both the divine source of the message and its inherent glory. 'Entrusted' implies a responsibility and faithfulness in the message that Paul feels he has received and is now passing on. This translation aims to capture the gravity and significance of the gospel in relation to God’s nature as blessed and glorious.|
|1TI 1:12|I give thanks to Christ Jesus our Lord, who has strengthened me, because He considered me faithful, appointing me to His service.|This verse emphasizes the grace and empowerment given to Paul by Christ, highlighting his faithfulness and appointment to ministry. The language reflects Paul's gratitude and recognition of God's enabling power in his life.|
|1TI 1:13|I was formerly a blasphemer, a persecutor, and an arrogant man; but I received mercy because I acted in ignorance and unbelief.|This verse reflects Paul's acknowledgment of his past sins and his transformation through God's mercy. The terms 'blasphemer', 'persecutor', and 'insolent man' highlight his previous actions, while the concept of ignorance emphasizes the grace extended to him despite those actions. The use of 'mercy' indicates a pivotal theme in Christian doctrine: forgiveness and redemption are available to all, regardless of their past.|
|1TI 1:14|And the grace of our Lord overflowed to me, along with faith and love that are in Christ Jesus.|This verse emphasizes the superabundance of grace given by the Lord, combined with faith and love that is found in Christ Jesus.

It reflects Paul's personal acknowledgment of his sinfulness and the transformative power of Christ’s salvation.|
|1TI 1:16|But for this very reason, I was shown mercy, so that in me, the worst of sinners, Christ Jesus might display his immense patience as an example for those who would believe in him and receive eternal life.|In this verse, Paul reflects on the grace and mercy he has received from Jesus Christ, emphasizing that his own experience serves as an example of Christ's extraordinary patience. This translation seeks to capture both the original Greek meaning and the depth of Paul's testimony.|
|1TI 1:17|Now to the King eternal, immortal, invisible, the only wise God, be honor and glory for ever and ever. Amen.|This translation captures the essence of the original Greek by emphasizing God's eternal nature and wisdom.

|1TI 1:19|holding on to faith and a good conscience. Some, by rejecting these, have shipwrecked their faith.|In this verse, the Apostle Paul emphasizes the importance of maintaining both faith and a good conscience as integral to the Christian walk. The phrase 'holding faith and a good conscience' conveys the necessity of both belief and moral integrity. The latter part of the verse indicates that some have rejected this dual necessity, leading to spiritual failure.|
|1TI 1:20|Among them are Hymenaeus and Alexander, whom I have handed over to Satan, so that they may learn not to blaspheme.|The verse speaks to the serious nature of heresy and blasphemy within the church community. By mentioning Hymenaeus and Alexander, Paul identifies them as examples of those who have rejected sound doctrine. The phrase 'delivered to Satan' indicates a form of church discipline meant to bring them to repentance, while the goal is to prevent them from blaspheming. It reflects the tension between mercy and judgment in maintaining the purity of the faith community.|
