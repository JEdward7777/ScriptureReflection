It uses terms for leadership and service, highlighting the humility required in those who lead.|
|LUK 22:27|For who is greater, the one who reclines at the table or the one who serves? Is it not the one who reclines? But I am among you as the one who serves.|In this verse, Jesus emphasizes the contrast between status and service.

|LUK 22:57|But he denied it, saying, 'Woman, I do not know him.'|The verb 'ἠρνήσατο' is a strong form of denial, indicating a firm rejection. The term 'γύναι' can be interpreted as a respectful form of address, similar to 'woman' or 'madam.' The phrase 'οὐκ οἶδα αὐτόν' translates to 'I do not know him' but in the context, it carries a weight of disassociation from Jesus. This translation maintains the original meaning and captures the emotion of Peter's denial.|
|LUK 22:58|And after a little while, another saw him and said, 'You also are one of them.' But Peter said, 'Man, I am not.'|In this verse, Peter's denial continues to build on the tension of the narrative, as he is identified as a follower of Jesus.

The phrase 'I do not know what you are saying' captures the essence of Peter's rejection of association with Jesus, while the context indicates a moment of personal crisis for him.|
|LUK 22:61|And turning, the Lord looked at Peter. And Peter remembered the word of the Lord, how He had said to him, 'Before the rooster crows, you will deny Me three times.'|In this verse, the gaze of the Lord symbolizes His awareness and recognition of human actions. The verb 'to look' indicates more than a mere glance; it carries a weight of understanding and emotional impact, especially in Peter's moment of realization of his failure.|
|LUK 22:62|And when he had gone outside, Peter wept bitterly.|The word 'πίκρως' is translated here as 'bitterly,' emphasizing the depth of Peter's sorrow and regret after denying Jesus. The structure of the sentence aims to convey both the immediacy of his emotional reaction and the significance of his failure.|
|LUK 22:63|And the men who were holding Jesus mocked Him, striking Him.|The term 'mocked' carries the connotation of ridicule and scorn, while 'beating' implies physical aggression. The structure of the Greek sentence highlights the continuous action of mocking during the time of Jesus' captivity.|

The wording focuses on the act of covering His head, striking Him, and questioning His role as a prophet, which underscores the humiliation and injustice He faced.|
|LUK 22:65|And they spoke many other blasphemous things against Him.|This verse captures the additional blasphemies spoken against Jesus, emphasizing the severity of the mocking and disrespect He faced. The verb 'blaspheme' reflects a deep offense and demonstrates the gravity of the insults hurled at Him, connecting it to Old Testament prophecies regarding the suffering servant.|
|LUK 22:66|When day broke, the council of the people assembled, along with the chief priests and the scribes, and they brought Him before their council, saying:|In this translation, I have aimed to maintain the formal tone consistent with legal proceedings and authority in the context of the passage. The use of 'council of the people' reflects the gathered authority of the religious leaders and the term 'led' is meant to denote the formal act of bringing Jesus before them for questioning.|
|LUK 22:67|If You are the Christ, tell us plainly. But He said to them, 'If I tell you, you will not believe me;'|In this verse, the emphasis is on the identity of Jesus as the Christ and the skepticism of the audience. The phrase 'If you are the Christ' indicates doubt and a challenge for Jesus to confirm His identity. The response highlights the futility of providing evidence to those unwilling to believe.|
|LUK 22:68|And if I were to ask you, you would neither answer me nor let me go.|This verse captures the essence of the challenge posed to Jesus by the religious leaders, emphasizing their refusal to engage with Him honestly, despite their questioning.

|LUK 22:71|And they said, 'What further need do we have for testimony? For we ourselves have heard it from his own mouth.'|The phrase 'What further evidence do we need?' implies a sense of finality in the judgment process. The emphasis on having heard from his own mouth reinforces the weight of his words as a testimony against him. This mirrors the concept of testimonies being sufficient in both legal and moral contexts within Jewish tradition.|
