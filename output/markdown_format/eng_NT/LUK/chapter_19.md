The use of 'entered' emphasizes the action of coming into the city, aligning with the overall theme of Jesus engaging with different communities.|
|LUK 19:2|And behold, there was a man named Zacchaeus; he was a chief tax collector, and he was wealthy.|The name 'Zacchaeus' means 'pure' or 'innocent', but he was known as a chief tax collector, indicating a contradiction in his societal role versus his name. The term 'rich' emphasizes his social status and the common view of wealth in the culture of that time.|
|LUK 19:3|And he sought to see who Jesus was, but could not because of the crowd, for he was short in stature.|This verse depicts Zacchaeus's determination to see Jesus, despite the physical limitations imposed by the crowd and his small stature.

|LUK 19:4|So he ran on ahead and climbed up into a sycamore tree to see him, for he was about to pass that way.|In this verse, the action of Zacchaeus running ahead and climbing a sycamore tree is a significant demonstration of his eagerness to see Jesus.

This reflects both the urgency and the lengths he would go to, symbolizing his desire for spiritual insight and connection with Jesus.|
|LUK 19:5|When Jesus reached the spot, He looked up and said to him, "Zacchaeus, hurry down! For I must stay at your house today."|The translation aims to capture the immediacy and personal touch of Jesus' command to Zacchaeus. The use of 'today' emphasizes the importance of the moment for salvation and communion. The phrase 'must stay' indicates a necessity in the divine plan for Jesus to spend time with Zacchaeus, reinforcing his desire for relationship and redemption.|
|LUK 19:6|So he hurried down and joyfully welcomed Him.|The verb 'σπεύσας' conveys a sense of urgency and promptness in action, while 'χαίρων' expresses a state of joy.

The choice of words aims to capture the emotional and immediate response of Zacchaeus as well as the welcoming nature of his actions towards Jesus.|
|LUK 19:7|All the people saw this and began to mutter, "He has gone to be the guest of a man who is a sinner."|The original text conveys the idea of the crowd's disapproval regarding Jesus' association with a tax collector, which was considered a sin in that context. The term 'sinner' (ἁμαρτωλῷ) is significant in demonstrating the social and religious stigma surrounding Zacchaeus. This translation aims to capture the shock and criticism expressed by the onlookers.|
|LUK 19:8|But Zacchaeus stood up and said to the Lord, 'Look, Lord! Here and now I give half of my possessions to the poor, and if I have cheated anyone out of anything, I will pay back four times the amount.'|In this verse, Zacchaeus expresses his repentance and desire for restitution, demonstrating a significant change of heart regarding wealth and social justice.

|LUK 19:12|Therefore He said, 'A certain nobleman went to a distant country to receive a kingdom for himself, and then return.'|In this verse, the term 'εὐγενὴς' (noble) suggests a person of high standing or importance. The context is a parable that emphasizes the journey toward receiving a kingdom, which reflects the anticipation of God's kingdom in relation to the teachings of Jesus. The phrase 'ἐπορεύθη εἰς χώραν μακρὰν' (went to a far country) indicates a significant departure, symbolizing the time Christ would be away before returning in glory.|

The word 'mnā' refers to a specific unit of currency, representing a significant investment entrusted to the slaves. The imperative 'realize a profit' captures the expectation of the nobleman for the slaves to actively engage in trade with the resources given to them while he is away, highlighting themes of stewardship and responsibility.|

The phrase conveys a sentiment of hostility and a refusal to accept leadership, paralleling the broader biblical theme of resistance against rightful authority.|
|LUK 19:15|And it happened that when he returned, having received the kingdom, he commanded that those servants be called to him to whom he had given the money, so that he might know what each had gained by trading.|This verse reflects the theme of accountability and the expectation of faithful stewardship, which is common in parables and teachings about the kingdom of God. The phrase 'call to account' implies an examination of the actions taken with the resources given, echoing a broader biblical principle of being responsible stewards of what God entrusts to us.|
|LUK 19:16|The first came forward, saying, ‘Master, your mina has earned ten minas more.’|The original text uses the word 'μνᾶ' (mina), a unit of currency in the biblical context, representing both a sum of money and the labor or return that comes from investing that money.

The original Greek terms are retained for faithfulness and authority, translating them in a way that is faithful to their meanings in this context.|
|LUK 19:18|And the second came, saying, ‘Lord, your mina has earned five minas more.’|In this translation, I aim to maintain the original meaning while making it accessible to contemporary readers. The term 'mina' is kept consistent to reflect the original currency without modernizing it to 'money' or similar terms.|
|LUK 19:19|And to him he said, ‘And you shall be in charge of five cities.’|This verse follows the pattern of rewarding faithfulness with increased responsibility. The use of 'five cities' implies a substantial reward for effective stewardship, resonating with the overall theme of responsibility found in biblical parables.|

|LUK 19:21|For I was afraid of you, because you are a severe man; you take up what you did not lay down, and reap what you did not sow.|This verse illustrates the fear and misunderstanding the servant has of his master’s character. The original language employs words that convey strictness and accountability. The focus is on the servant’s perception of his master as someone who demands results without regard for effort or circumstance, leading to his own failure to act. The use of ‘reaping’ and ‘sowing’ emphasizes the principle of responsibility and the consequences of one's actions.|
|LUK 19:22|He said to him, 'By your own words I will judge you, you wicked servant. You knew that I am a harsh man, taking up what I did not lay down and reaping what I did not sow.|In this verse, the master uses strong language to confront the servant about his character and the implications of his actions. The term 'wicked' suggests moral failing and a lack of diligence, and the severity of the master's character is emphasized through the repetition of themes regarding sowing and reaping.|
|LUK 19:23|And why did you not place my money on deposit, so that when I returned, I could have collected it with interest?|In this verse, the emphasis is on the expected actions of a servant, specifically regarding the handling of resources.

The translation attempts to capture the rhetorical question's tone and implication of judgment regarding the servant's lack of initiative.|
|LUK 19:24|And to those standing by, he said, 'Take the mina away from him and give it to the one who has ten minas.'|In this verse, the master instructs that the mina should be taken from the unproductive servant and given to the one who already has ten. This reflects a principle of stewardship and the expectation of returns on entrusted resources, emphasizing the importance of faithful service and the consequences of inaction.|
|LUK 19:25|And they said to him, 'Master, he has ten minas already.'|In this verse, the focus is on the distribution of resources based on the stewardship of what one has been given. The context relates to the parable of the minas, emphasizing the principle that those who effectively use what they are given will receive even more, while those who do not will lose what they have.|
|LUK 19:26|I tell you that to everyone who has, more will be given; but from the one who does not have, even what he thinks he has will be taken away from him.|This verse illustrates the principle of stewardship and reward based on one's faithfulness with what they have been entrusted. The message emphasizes that those who make good use of their resources will receive more, while those who fail to utilize their resources wisely will lose what they have.|
