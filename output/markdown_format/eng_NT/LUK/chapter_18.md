| Reference | Verse | Translation Notes |
|:---------:|-------|-------------------|
|LUK 18:1|And He told them a parable to show that they should always pray and not lose heart.|This verse emphasizes the importance of persistent prayer and discourages losing heart, reflecting a core teaching of faith and reliance on God through prayer.|
|LUK 18:2|He said: "In a certain city, there was a judge who did not fear God nor regard man."|In this verse, the description of the judge highlights his lack of reverence for God and disregard for man, establishing a character who is unjust and unaccountable, a significant point in the parable Jesus shares.|
|LUK 18:3|And there was a widow in that city; and she came to him, saying, 'Grant me justice against my adversary.'|The term 'widow' signifies someone who has lost their husband and may symbolize vulnerability. The request for justice 'against my adversary' conveys the theme of seeking justice or vindication in the face of opposition. The phrase captures the essence of earnest pleading for deliverance from wrongdoings inflicted by another.|
|LUK 18:4|And for a time he refused; but afterward he said to himself, 'Though I do not fear God nor respect man,'.|In this verse, the contrast between divine and human authority is significant. The phrase 'I do not fear God' reflects the character of the unjust judge and sets the stage for understanding the nature of God's justice compared to human injustice. The usage of 'fear' and 'shame' ties into biblical themes of reverence and moral obligation.|
|LUK 18:5|Yet because this widow keeps bothering me, I will grant her justice, so that she will not wear me out by her continual coming.|The translation captures the essence of the judge's initial reluctance, highlighting the persistence of the widow as a critical factor for change in the judge's attitude. The phrase 'to give me trouble' reflects the judge's feeling of being worn down by her continual coming, indicating her tenacity in seeking justice.|
|LUK 18:6|And the Lord said, 'Listen to what the unjust judge says;'|This verse presents a contrast between a corrupt judge and the righteous character of God. The judge's unwillingness is overcome by the widow's persistence, illustrating the principle of perseverance in prayer and faith. The term 'unjust judge' highlights the disparity between human judgment and divine justice.|
|LUK 18:7|And will not God bring about justice for His chosen ones who cry out to Him day and night? Will He keep putting them off?|This translation emphasizes God's justice and willingness to respond to the persistent cries of His chosen ones. The words reflect both the urgency and faithfulness in prayer, contrasting God's character with that of the unjust judge mentioned earlier.|
|LUK 18:8|I tell you that He will surely bring about justice for them swiftly. But when the Son of Man comes, will He find faith on the earth?|In this translation, I have emphasized the urgency and reliability of God's justice, as well as the important theme of faith that underpins Jesus' rhetorical question regarding His return. The phrase 'in a hurry' captures the swift action of God in response to the faithful, while 'the Son of Man' specifically identifies Jesus in His human role. The inquiry into whether He will find faith highlights the ongoing challenge of maintaining belief in a world of tribulation.|
|LUK 18:9|He also told this parable to some who trusted in themselves that they were righteous and despised others:|This verse highlights the attitude of self-righteousness and disdain for others that some individuals held during Jesus' time. The term 'justified in themselves' reflects a false sense of righteousness that is contrasted with genuine humility before God.|
|LUK 18:10|Two men went up to the temple to pray, one a Pharisee and the other a tax collector.|The verse captures the contrasting attitudes of two individuals in prayer, emphasizing their distinct approaches to God and the concept of humility versus self-righteousness.|

|LUK 18:12|I fast twice a week and give a tenth of all I acquire.|In this verse, the speaker expresses his commitment to fasting and tithing, highlighting his religious observance. The original Greek text emphasizes the frequency of the fasting and the completeness of the tithing, which are key elements in the Pharisaical approach to piety. The terms used are preserved to maintain the weight of his self-righteousness while contrasting it with the humble position of the tax collector from the previous verse.|
|LUK 18:13|But the tax collector, standing far off, would not even lift his eyes to heaven, but beat his breast, saying, 'God, have mercy on me, a sinner!'|This verse captures the humility and repentance of the tax collector, contrasting with the self-righteous attitude of the Pharisee. The phrase 'God, be merciful to me, a sinner' reflects a deep acknowledgment of one's unworthiness and need for God's grace.|
|LUK 18:14|I tell you, this man went down to his house justified rather than the other; for everyone who lifts himself up will be brought low, but he who humbles himself will be lifted high.|This verse emphasizes the divine principle of humility and exaltation. It contrasts the self-righteousness of the Pharisee with the genuine humility of the tax collector, showcasing how God honors those who recognize their need for grace.|
|LUK 18:15|People were also bringing babies to Him so that He might touch them; but when the disciples saw it, they rebuked them.|The original text presents a scenario where children are being brought to Jesus for His blessing. The word 'brefi' (βρέφη) specifically refers to infants or young children. The disciples' reaction shows a common theme of misunderstanding the value of children in the eyes of Jesus. In this fresh translation, I aimed to maintain the essence and context while ensuring clarity for modern readers.|
|LUK 18:16|But Jesus called them to Him, saying, "Let the children come to Me, and do not hinder them; for to such belongs the kingdom of God."|In this verse, Jesus emphasizes the importance of children in the Kingdom of God. The term 'children' is not limited to physical age but signifies a state of innocence and openness that is necessary for receiving the divine. The use of 'come to Me' suggests an invitation to embrace faith with childlike trust.|
|LUK 18:17|Truly, I tell you, whoever does not receive the kingdom of God like a child will never enter it.|This verse emphasizes the necessity of receiving the kingdom of God with the simplicity and trust of a child. The original Greek highlights the phrase 'οὐ μὴ εἰσέλθῃ' which can be translated as 'will not enter,' emphasizing the certainty of the statement. This translation maintains the straightforward and profound nature of Jesus’ teaching.|
|LUK 18:18|And a ruler asked him, saying, "Good Teacher, what must I do to inherit eternal life?"|In this verse, the question posed by the ruler encapsulates the themes of goodness and eternal life, which are central to the teachings of Jesus. The term 'Good Teacher' is significant, as it highlights both reverence and the underlying inquiry about the nature of goodness necessary for eternal life. The translation strives to convey the formal address and earnestness of the question while remaining faithful to the original Greek text.|
|LUK 18:19|But Jesus said to him, "Why do you call me good? No one is good except for God alone."|In this verse, Jesus emphasizes the concept of goodness and points to God as the only true source of goodness. This challenges the ruler's understanding of goodness and his use of the term 'good Teacher.' The intention is to redirect the focus from Jesus' perceived goodness to God's ultimate goodness.|
|LUK 18:20|You know the commandments: Do not commit adultery, do not murder, do not steal, do not give false testimony, honor your father and your mother.|This verse is a listing of commandments that underscore ethical conduct in personal and community relationships. The translation aims to capture the directive nature of the original Greek and the moral imperatives reflected in the commandments.|
|LUK 18:21|He replied, 'I have kept all these commandments since my youth.'|The phrase 'I have kept all these' is an assertion of the young man's adherence to the commandments since his youth. The term 'from my youth' indicates a lifelong commitment to the laws and morals that are part of the Judeo-Christian ethical framework. The translation maintains the original emphasis on both personal responsibility and spiritual diligence.|
|LUK 18:22|When Jesus heard this, He said to him, 'There is still one thing you lack: Sell all that you have and distribute to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven. Then come, follow me.'|This verse emphasizes Jesus' command for the man to sell his possessions and distribute the proceeds to the poor. The invitation to follow Him highlights the call to discipleship and prioritizing spiritual wealth over material wealth.|
|LUK 18:23|But when he heard these things, he became very sad, for he was extremely wealthy.|This translation captures the essence of the rich young ruler's sorrow upon realizing the cost of discipleship, emphasizing his great wealth as a significant barrier to following Jesus.|
|LUK 18:24|But seeing him distressed, Jesus said, "How hard it is for those who possess wealth to enter the kingdom of God!"|In this verse, Jesus expresses a deep concern for the spiritual state of those who are attached to wealth. The word 'difficult' (δύσκολως) is key, indicating a struggle that wealth can create in seeking the Kingdom of God. The phrasing is intentional to show the paradox of wealth and spiritual readiness.|
|LUK 18:25|For it is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than for a wealthy person to enter the kingdom of God.|The imagery of the camel and the needle's eye serves as a striking metaphor emphasizing the extreme difficulty of a wealthy individual entering God's kingdom. This challenges the prevailing belief of wealth being synonymous with God's favor. In this context, the 'kingdom of God' signifies a spiritual realm of divine rule, contrasting worldly values with divine principles.|
|LUK 18:26|Those who heard this said, 'Then who can possibly be saved?'|This verse reflects the disciples' astonishment and concern regarding the challenge of salvation, particularly for those with wealth, emphasizing the difficulty of human efforts in attaining salvation without divine assistance.|
|LUK 18:27|But He said, "What is impossible for people is possible for God."|This verse emphasizes the omnipotence of God, contrasting human limitations with divine capabilities. The structure of the Greek phrase reflects a direct correlation between human inability and God's ability, reinforcing the message that divine intervention is essential for salvation.|
|LUK 18:28|And Peter said, 'Look, we have forsaken everything and followed you.'|This verse highlights Peter's acknowledgment of the sacrifices made by the disciples in their commitment to follow Jesus. The phrase 'we have left everything' reflects the call of discipleship, emphasizing total devotion to Christ. The translation maintains the essence of Peter's declaration without mimicking existing versions.|

The wording is chosen to reflect the commitment of believers who give up familial ties or possessions in pursuit of their faith.

|LUK 18:30|who will not receive many times more in this present age, and in the age to come, eternal life.|This verse emphasizes the reward for sacrifices made for the sake of the Kingdom of God, particularly highlighting the promise of both material and spiritual blessings in this life and the next.|

The phrase 'it will all be fulfilled' underscores the necessity of the events that are to unfold, as foretold by the prophets, relating to the mission and fate of the Son of Man.

|LUK 18:34|But they did not understand any of these things. This saying was hidden from them, and they did not grasp what was said.|In this verse, the disciples fail to comprehend the prophetic words concerning Jesus' impending suffering and resurrection. The phrase 'to them' indicates a specific group, namely the disciples, who were perplexed by the mystery of Christ's mission. This is reflective of a recurring theme in the New Testament where understanding spiritual truths requires divine revelation, as evidenced in the related verses.|
|LUK 18:35|As Jesus drew near to Jericho, a certain blind man was sitting by the roadside begging.|In this verse, the focus is on the proximity of Jesus to Jericho and the situation of a blind man who is begging. The Greek word 'τυφλός' (blind) emphasizes the man's condition, which is important in the context of the miraculous events that follow. The term 'προσαίτων' (begging) reflects the man's social status and dependence on the mercy of others, a recurring theme in biblical narratives involving healing and compassion.|
|LUK 18:36|And hearing the multitude passing by, he asked what this meant.|This translation seeks to capture the essence of the original Greek text, emphasizing the inquiry of the blind man regarding the commotion of the crowd.
