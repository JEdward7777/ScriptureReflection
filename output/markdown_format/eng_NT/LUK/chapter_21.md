|LUK 21:1|As He looked up, Jesus saw the rich putting their gifts into the treasury.|In this verse, the focus is on Jesus observing those who contribute to the temple treasury, particularly highlighting the distinction between the wealthy and the sacrificial nature of their giving. The term 'γαζοφυλάκιον' refers to the temple treasury, indicating a place of significant religious importance where offerings were made. The context of this observation underscores Jesus' teaching on the heart behind giving, rather than the mere act of giving itself.|
|LUK 21:2|And He saw a poor widow putting in two small coins there.|The Greek term 'λεπτά' refers to small coins, emphasizing the humble amount the widow offers, while 'χήρα' denotes a widow, signifying her vulnerability and social status. This translation seeks to capture both the emotional weight and the socio-economic context of her action.|
|LUK 21:3|And He said, "Truly I tell you, this poor widow has put in more than all the others."|This verse highlights the principle that true value in giving is not determined by the amount given but by the heart behind the act. The term 'poor widow' signifies both her financial status and her sacrificial spirit, which is a recurring theme in Scripture regarding generosity and faith.|
|LUK 21:4|For all these gave from their surplus to the offerings of God, but she, out of her poverty, gave all she had to live on.|This verse emphasizes the contrast between the wealthy who give from their surplus and the poor widow who gives sacrificially from her need, thus highlighting the depth of her faith and commitment to God.|

|LUK 21:8|And He said, "Watch yourselves that you are not led astray; for many will come in My name, saying, 'I am He,' and, 'The time has come near.' Do not follow them."|In this translation, I emphasize the warning Jesus gives to his followers about being misled by false claims of His name. The terms used in the original Greek ('πλανηθῆτε' for 'led astray' and 'ἐπὶ τῷ ὀνόματί μου' for 'in my name') are crucial in conveying the urgency and significance of His message.|
|LUK 21:9|But when you hear of wars and upheavals, do not be frightened; for these things must happen first, but the end will not come immediately.|This translation emphasizes the importance of remaining steadfast and not being fearful in the face of conflict and chaos.

It mirrors themes found in other scriptural references about betrayal and familial strife in the face of faith and adversity.|
|LUK 21:17|And you will be hated by all because of my name.|This verse highlights the hostility believers will face for their association with Jesus.

|LUK 21:19|By your patience, you will secure your souls.|The term 'patience' in this context conveys a sense of steadfastness and endurance under pressure.

The phrase 'until the times of the Gentiles are fulfilled' points to a significant theological period in God's redemptive plan.|
|LUK 21:25|And there will be signs in the sun, and in the moon, and in the stars; and on the earth, nations will be in anguish, confused by the roaring of the sea and the waves.|This verse emphasizes cosmic signs that will accompany great turmoil on earth.

The phrase "φόβου καὶ προσδοκίας" (fear and expectation) illustrates the psychological state of people facing the unknown. Additionally, the phrase "αἱ γὰρ δυνάμεις τῶν οὐρανῶν σαλευθήσονται" indicates a significant cosmic disturbance, drawing on apocalyptic imagery common in scripture.|

|LUK 21:29|And He told them a parable: "Look at the fig tree, and all the trees.|This verse emphasizes the use of the fig tree and all trees as symbols for understanding the signs of the times. The word 'ἴδετε' (behold) invites the listeners to observe closely, while 'συκῆν' (fig tree) and 'δένδρα' (trees) represent growth and change in nature that signals forthcoming events.|
|LUK 21:30|When they are already putting forth leaves, you see for yourselves and know that summer is now near.|In this verse, the imagery of observing natural signs (the fig tree and other trees) serves to illustrate the nearness of God's kingdom. The terms 'probalōsi' (to sprout or to bud) and 'theoros' (to perceive) are pivotal in communicating the idea of recognizing imminent changes in the spiritual realm, much like recognizing seasons in nature.|

|LUK 21:33|Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will never pass away.|The original Greek emphasizes the permanence and reliability of Jesus’ words compared to the transient nature of the heavens and the earth. The phrase 'οἱ δὲ λόγοι μου οὐ μὴ παρέλθωσι' specifically underscores that His words will endure beyond all else.|
