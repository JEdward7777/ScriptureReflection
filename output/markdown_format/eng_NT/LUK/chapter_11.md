|LUK 11:1|Now it happened, while He was praying in a certain place, that when He stopped, one of His disciples said to Him, 'Lord, teach us to pray, just as John also taught his disciples.'|This verse highlights the disciples' request for Jesus to teach them how to pray, reflecting a desire for guidance in their spiritual practice. The phrase 'teach us to pray' indicates a recognition of the importance of prayer in their relationship with God. The comparison to John the Baptist's disciples suggests a tradition of formal teaching on prayer.|
|LUK 11:2|He said to them, 'When you pray, say: Our Father in heaven, hallowed be Your name; let Your kingdom come; let Your will be done, on earth as it is in heaven.'|This verse serves as the foundation for the Lord's Prayer, emphasizing the reverence due to God's name and the desire for His kingdom and will to be manifested on earth as it is in heaven. It reflects a structured approach to prayer, encouraging believers to seek a personal relationship with God as their Father.|
|LUK 11:3|Give us each day our bread for tomorrow.|The term 'daily bread' (ἐπιούσιον) refers to the sustenance necessary for each day, highlighting the dependence on God for physical and spiritual needs. The prayer emphasizes asking for provision in a daily context, reflecting the Israelites' experience with manna.|
|LUK 11:4|And forgive us our sins, for we also forgive everyone indebted to us; and lead us not into temptation, but rescue us from the evil one.|This verse emphasizes the importance of forgiveness in the Christian faith, drawing a parallel between God's forgiveness of our sins and our obligation to forgive those who have wronged us. The term 'temptation' relates to trials that test faith, while 'the evil one' highlights the source of spiritual opposition. It calls believers to seek divine deliverance from such challenges.|
|LUK 11:5|And he said to them, "Which of you has a friend who will go to him at midnight and say to him, 'Friend, lend me three loaves of bread?'|In this verse, the emphasis is on the social context of asking for help from a friend at an unusual hour. The request is not only a matter of need but also speaks to the bonds of friendship and the expectation of hospitality, which was culturally significant in the ancient Near East. The fresh translation captures this spirit.|
|LUK 11:6|For a friend of mine has come to me from a journey, and I have nothing to set before him.|This verse illustrates the urgency of hospitality and the obligation to provide for a friend in need. The words ‘friend’ and ‘provide’ are central to the understanding of the request being made. The phrase reflects both the context of friendship and the social customs of the time, emphasizing the importance of support in community relationships.|
|LUK 11:7|And he from within will answer, ‘Do not trouble me; the door is already shut, and my children are with me in bed; I cannot rise and give you anything.’|In this verse, the focus is on the inability to provide help due to the circumstances of being already in bed, which underscores themes of urgency and the struggle of prioritizing one's needs in the face of interruptions. The phrase 'the door is already closed' conveys a finality that reflects a barrier to action, contrasting with the earlier invitation to seek help.|
|LUK 11:8|I tell you, even if he will not get up and give him anything because he is his friend, yet because of his boldness, he will rise and give him as much as he needs.|This verse illustrates the importance of persistence in prayer and the dynamics of friendship and audacity in seeking help. The term 'anāideian' (ἀναίδειαν) emphasizes boldness or shamelessness, highlighting how such persistence can lead to favorable outcomes, even when the initial response may be reluctant.|
|LUK 11:9|So I say to you: Ask, and it will be given to you; seek, and you will find; knock, and it will be opened to you.|This translation seeks to convey the encouragement to actively seek and request from God. The original Greek words 'αἰτεῖτε', 'ζητεῖτε', and 'κρούετε' imply not only a request but also an active pursuit and knocking on a door, signifying earnestness in prayer and seeking.|
|LUK 11:10|For everyone who asks receives, and he who seeks finds, and to him who knocks it will be opened.|This verse reinforces the idea of persistence in prayer and the assurance that God responds to those who earnestly seek Him. The verbs 'ask', 'seek', and 'knock' convey the active participation required in the believer's relationship with God, emphasizing faith and expectation in His response.|
|LUK 11:11|Which of you fathers, if your son asks for a loaf of bread, will give him a stone? Or if he asks for a fish, will give him a serpent instead?|This verse employs a rhetorical style to illustrate the nature of a loving father's response to his child's requests. The analogy of providing bread instead of stone emphasizes the goodness and generosity expected from a father figure, mirroring God's provision and care for His children.|
|LUK 11:12|Or if he asks for an egg, will he give him a scorpion?|This verse emphasizes the concept of parenthood and the nature of giving, contrasting what is good and beneficial with what is harmful. The analogy is maintained to demonstrate the absurdity of providing harmful gifts instead of helpful ones.|
|LUK 11:13|If you then, being evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will the heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to those who ask Him?|In this verse, the emphasis is on the character of God as a loving Father who gives good gifts, contrasting it with human nature. The original Greek term for 'evil' refers to a moral deficiency, implying that even flawed humans are capable of giving good gifts to their children. Thus, the argument is that God, being perfectly good, will provide even better gifts to those who ask Him.|
|LUK 11:14|And He was casting out a demon that was mute. When the demon left, the mute spoke, and the crowds were amazed.|In this verse, the action of casting out a demon highlights the authority of Jesus over unclean spirits. The miracle of the mute speaking serves as a testament to both His power and the wonder it incites in the crowds. The terms used, such as 'casting out' and 'mute,' have been carefully translated to preserve the original meaning while ensuring clarity for modern readers.|
|LUK 11:15|But some of them said, 'He casts out demons by Beelzebul, the ruler of the demons.'|In this verse, the term 'Beelzebul' is a reference to a title given to a chief demon, indicating a strong opposition to Jesus' ministry. The use of the word 'demon' suggests the spiritual battle occurring during His ministry, where accusations arise against His authority to cast them out. This reflects the misunderstanding of Jesus’ power and the religious leaders’ intent to undermine His work by attributing it to demonic forces.|
|LUK 11:16|Others, to test him, demanded a sign from heaven.|In this verse, the emphasis is on the challenge posed to Jesus, highlighting the request for a sign from heaven as a test. The choice of the word 'sign' (σημεῖον) is consistent with how it is used in other instances where miraculous proofs are sought to validate authority or divinity.|
|LUK 11:17|But he, knowing their thoughts, said to them, "Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation, and a house divided against a house falls."|In this verse, Jesus addresses the notion of internal division among kingdoms or houses, emphasizing that division leads to ruin. The terms 'kingdom' and 'house' suggest a broader application to any form of leadership or organization, making the implications universal. The use of 'waste' and 'fall' in describing the consequences of division highlights the seriousness of unity for survival and function.|
|LUK 11:18|But if Satan is divided against himself, how will his kingdom endure? For you say that I cast out demons by Beelzebul.|This verse addresses the concept of internal division within the kingdom of Satan, emphasizing that if even Satan were to be divided against himself, his kingdom would not stand. The term 'Beelzebul' references the prince of demons, which connects to the broader context of spiritual authority and conflict.|
|LUK 11:19|But if I cast out demons by Beelzebul, by whom do your sons cast them out? Therefore, they will be your judges.|This verse emphasizes the challenge to the accusers by questioning their reasoning. It indicates that if Jesus casts out demons by Beelzebul, then their own sons must also have a source of power to do so, placing the accusers in a position of self-judgment. It uses a rhetorical question to highlight the inconsistency in their accusations against Jesus.|
|LUK 11:20|But if I cast out demons by the finger of God, then the kingdom of God has come upon you.|The phrase 'by the finger of God' emphasizes divine authority and intervention in the act of casting out demons. This serves to highlight the legitimacy of Jesus’ ministry in contrast to accusations of demonic affiliation. The term 'kingdom of God' denotes the reign of God manifesting through Jesus’ actions, indicating a pivotal moment in redemptive history.|
|LUK 11:21|When a strong man, fully armed, guards his own palace, his possessions are safe.|This verse presents a metaphorical contrast between the strong man's protection of his own possessions and the authority that is required to overcome him. The use of 'strong' reflects a biblical understanding of power and security, and emphasizes the significance of vigilance and strength in spiritual warfare.|
|LUK 11:22|But when a stronger man comes upon him and overcomes him, he takes away the armor in which he trusted and distributes his spoils.|In this verse, the imagery of the stronger man reflects the spiritual battle between good and evil. The act of taking away the armor signifies overcoming reliance on earthly defenses and trusting in God's strength instead. This fresh translation aims to capture the essence of spiritual warfare and the power of faith.|
|LUK 11:23|Whoever is not with me is against me; and whoever does not gather with me scatters.|This verse emphasizes the idea of alignment and opposition regarding Jesus’ mission. The imagery used suggests a clear choice between two sides. The terms 'with' and 'against' are crucial in conveying the sense of commitment or opposition to Jesus and his work.|
|LUK 11:24|When the unclean spirit goes out from a person, it roams through dry places seeking rest, and finding none, it says, ‘I will return to the house from which I came.’|This verse highlights the theme of spiritual struggle, depicting an unclean spirit that seeks rest and returns to its former dwelling. The phrase 'waterless places' is symbolic of spiritual desolation. The translation aims to maintain clarity while respecting the nuances of the original Greek.|
|LUK 11:25|And upon returning, it finds the house swept clean and beautifully arranged.|The Greek word 'σεσαρωμένον' translates to 'swept clean' implying a state of emptiness or vulnerability after the unclean spirit leaves. 'κεκοσμημένον' translates to 'garnished' or 'adorned,' suggesting a superficial appearance of order or beauty, but lacking true substance or protection.|
|LUK 11:26|Then it goes and takes seven other spirits more wicked than itself, and they enter in and dwell there; and the last state of that person is worse than the first.|This verse highlights the danger of spiritual emptiness and the tendency for one's condition to worsen after an initial cleansing or improvement. It emphasizes the importance of filling one’s life with righteousness to prevent a worse state.|
|LUK 11:27|As he was saying these things, a woman in the crowd raised her voice and said to him, 'Blessed is the womb that bore you and the breasts at which you nursed!'|This verse reflects a spontaneous declaration of blessing upon Mary, the mother of Jesus. The language used highlights the honor associated with her role in bearing the Savior. The phraseology mirrors the themes of blessedness found throughout the Scriptures, particularly in the Beatitudes and in the Annunciation.|
|LUK 11:28|But He said, 'Indeed, blessed are those who hear the word of God and keep it!'|The term 'blessed' used here reflects the happiness or spiritual well-being associated with obedience to God's Word. The phrase 'those who hear' emphasizes the importance of not only listening but also acting upon the teachings.|
|LUK 11:29|As the crowds gathered around Him, He began to say, 'This generation is a wicked generation. It seeks a sign, and no sign will be given to it except the sign of Jonah the prophet.'|In this translation, the phrase 'this generation' refers specifically to the people witnessing Jesus' ministry at that time. The term 'evil' is indicative of their rejection of the divine message, seeking miraculous signs instead of faith. The reference to 'the sign of Jonah' serves as a foreshadowing of Jesus' own resurrection, which is the ultimate sign of His authority and messianic mission.|
|LUK 11:30|For just as Jonah became a sign to the people of Nineveh, so will the Son of Man be a sign to this generation.|This verse draws a parallel between Jonah's experience as a sign to the Ninevites and the future significance of Jesus as a sign to His generation. It highlights the prophetic role of both figures in conveying God's message of repentance and judgment.|
|LUK 11:31|The Queen of the South will rise in judgment with the men of this generation and condemn them, for she came from the farthest parts of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and behold, something greater than Solomon is here.|In this verse, Jesus contrasts the wisdom of Solomon with His own divine authority, indicating that the Queen of the South recognized Solomon's wisdom and that those in Jesus' time are missing an even greater revelation. The translation emphasizes the significance of seeking wisdom and understanding, reflecting the importance placed on these concepts throughout scripture.|
|LUK 11:32|The men of Nineveh will rise up at the judgment with this generation and condemn it, for they repented at the preaching of Jonah, and behold, something greater than Jonah is here.|In this verse, Jesus draws a contrast between the response of the Ninevites to Jonah's message and the indifference of His own generation. The term 'repented' underscores a significant theme of repentance in biblical teaching, showing that genuine acknowledgment of one's wrongdoing can lead to restoration.|
|LUK 11:33|No one lights a lamp and puts it in a hidden place or under a basket, but on a lampstand, so that those who come in may see its light.|In this verse, Jesus is emphasizing the purpose of light—to illuminate and guide. The use of the lamp metaphor illustrates the importance of visibility and the accessibility of truth to all who seek it. The phrase 'on a lampstand' indicates the intended place for light, reinforcing the notion that one should not hide what is meant to shine for others.|
|LUK 11:34|The eye is the lamp of your body. When your eye is clear, your whole body is also full of light; but when it is bad, your body is also full of darkness.|This verse highlights the metaphor of the eye functioning as a lamp for the body, indicating that one's perception influences their entire being. A 'healthy' eye symbolizes clear and true vision, leading to a life filled with spiritual illumination. Conversely, a 'wicked' eye leads to darkness, suggesting moral or spiritual blindness.|
|LUK 11:35|Therefore, be careful that the light within you is not darkness.|In this verse, the emphasis is on the necessity of discernment regarding the source of one's inner illumination. The word 'light' symbolizes understanding and clarity, while 'darkness' signifies confusion or moral failure. The structure reflects a caution against self-deception about one's spiritual condition.|
|LUK 11:36|If then your body is all full of light, having no part dark, it will be entirely illuminated, as when the lamp gives you light with its brightness.|This verse emphasizes the importance of having an inner light that illuminates one’s entire being. It contrasts the condition of being wholly illuminated versus having any part of oneself in darkness. The metaphor of a lamp and its illumination is central to understanding the nature of spiritual insight and clarity.|
|LUK 11:37|While he was speaking, a Pharisee asked him to dine with him. So he went in and reclined at the table.|In this verse, the Pharisee's inquiry to Jesus emphasizes the social customs and expectations of hospitality. The phrase 'he reclined' indicates the manner of eating in that cultural context, where one would recline at the table, indicative of a formal meal setting.|
|LUK 11:38|But the Pharisee, when he saw it, was astonished that he had not first washed before the meal.|This translation focuses on the Pharisee's astonishment at Jesus' apparent neglect of the customary washing ritual before meals. The choice of words aims to convey the cultural context and significance of the act of washing, which was seen as a critical step in maintaining ceremonial purity.|
|LUK 11:39|But the Lord said to him, 'Now you Pharisees cleanse the outside of the cup and the dish, but inside you are filled with greed and wickedness.'|This verse emphasizes the hypocrisy of the Pharisees, who focus on external cleanliness while neglecting their inner moral condition. The Greek term 'ἁρπαγῆς' (harpagēs) refers to greed or extortion, indicating the serious nature of their inner corruption. The phrase 'καὶ πονηρίας' (kai ponērias) speaks to their wickedness, which further illustrates the contrast between outward appearance and inner reality.|
|LUK 11:40|You fools! Did not the One who made the outside also make the inside?|In this verse, Jesus addresses the Pharisees directly, emphasizing their foolishness (ἄφρονες) for neglecting the inner moral and spiritual state while focusing only on outward appearances. The phrase highlights the contrast between God's holistic understanding of cleanliness that involves both external actions and internal purity.|
|LUK 11:41|But rather, give what is within as charity, and behold, everything will be clean for you.|This translation emphasizes the call to generosity and the concept that giving to those in need purifies the heart and spirit, connecting the act of giving with inner cleanliness before God.|
|LUK 11:42|But woe to you, Pharisees! For you meticulously tithe mint, rue, and every kind of herb, yet you neglect justice and the love of God. These you ought to have practiced, without ignoring the others.|In this verse, Jesus critiques the Pharisees for their meticulous tithing of even the smallest herbs, while they overlook the more significant aspects of God's command, which include justice and love. The translation maintains the imperative nature of Jesus' statement, emphasizing the importance of both observance and underlying principles.|
|LUK 11:43|Woe to you, Pharisees! For you love the seats of honor in the synagogues and the greetings in the marketplaces.|In this verse, Jesus addresses the Pharisees, highlighting their desire for honor and recognition in public settings. The term 'first seats' or 'places of honor' denotes their ambition to be esteemed above others, reflecting their focus on outward appearances rather than genuine spirituality. This translation maintains the strong condemnation expressed by Jesus and uses straightforward language that captures the essence of the original Greek text.|
|LUK 11:44|Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you are like unmarked graves, and the people walking over them are unaware.|This verse emphasizes the hypocrisy of the religious leaders, comparing them to hidden graves that people walk over without realizing what is beneath them. The imagery of being 'like unmarked graves' illustrates how they appear righteous outwardly but are spiritually dead inside, highlighting the theme of inner purity versus outward appearances.|
|LUK 11:45|One of the lawyers answered him, "Teacher, in saying these things, you insult us as well."|The verse highlights the conflict between Jesus and the religious leaders, emphasizing the tension when one's teachings challenge the status quo. The word 'hybrizing' conveys a sense of insult or offense taken by the lawyers, reflecting their reaction to Jesus’ condemnation of their practices.|
|LUK 11:46|But He said, "Woe to you also, lawyers! For you load men with burdens hard to bear, but you yourselves do not touch the burdens with one of your fingers."|This verse speaks to the heavy burdens that the religious leaders place upon others while failing to assist them in any meaningful way. The original Greek highlights the hypocrisy in their actions, emphasizing the lack of help given to those they burden.|
|LUK 11:47|Woe to you! For you build the tombs of the prophets, and your fathers killed them.|This verse highlights the hypocrisy of the people who honor the prophets by building their tombs while ignoring their messages and killing the prophets themselves. It reflects on the irony of commemorating those who were rejected and persecuted by the ancestors of the same people.|
|LUK 11:48|Therefore, you testify and approve of the works of your fathers; for they killed the prophets, and you are building their tombs.|In this verse, Jesus condemns the Pharisees and their complicity in honoring the prophets while at the same time agreeing with the actions of their forefathers who killed them. The emphasis is on the hypocrisy of celebrating the memory of the prophets while participating in the same lineage of violence against them. Key terms include 'testify,' 'consent,' 'works,' 'fathers,' 'killed,' and 'build.' The use of 'building' signifies the way the religious leaders seek to commemorate the prophets while denying the reality of their murder by their ancestors.|
|LUK 11:49|For this reason, the wisdom of God declared, ‘I will send them prophets and apostles, and some of them they will kill and persecute.’|This verse highlights the Divine wisdom in sending prophets and apostles, acknowledging the historical pattern of rejection and persecution by the people. The choice of the term 'wisdom of God' signifies a deeper understanding of God's plan for salvation through these messengers, emphasizing that their suffering is part of the prophetic tradition.|
|LUK 11:50|so that the blood of all the prophets, which has been shed since the foundation of the world, may be sought after from this generation.|In this verse, Jesus speaks about the shedding of the blood of prophets, indicating that it has occurred since the foundation of the world, emphasizing a longstanding pattern of violence against God's messengers throughout history. The reference to ‘from the foundation of the world’ aligns with a Biblical worldview that acknowledges God's plan and knowledge of human history and sinfulness from the beginning.|
|LUK 11:51|from the blood of Abel to the blood of Zechariah, who was slain between the altar and the sanctuary; yes, I tell you, it will be required of this generation.|The phrase 'from the blood of Abel to the blood of Zechariah' highlights the continuity of violence against the righteous throughout biblical history. This fresh translation maintains the emphasis on the severity of judgment upon that generation for their rejection of God's messengers.|
|LUK 11:52|Woe to you experts in the law! For you have taken away the key to knowledge. You yourselves did not enter, and you hindered those who were trying to enter.|In this translation, I have focused on the themes of knowledge, access, and obstruction that are present in the original text. The 'key of knowledge' metaphor signifies both understanding and the ability to enter into deeper spiritual truths. This fresh translation captures the original context and intent while maintaining clarity and faithfulness to the source.|
|LUK 11:53|As He spoke these things, the scribes and the Pharisees began to provoke Him vehemently and to press Him hard about many matters.|In this verse, the confrontation intensifies as the scribes and Pharisees react vehemently to Jesus’ words. The term 'δεινῶς' (terribly or greatly) emphasizes their strong opposition. The phrase 'ἀποστοματίζειν' can indicate a forceful verbal attack or counter-argument against Jesus.|
|LUK 11:54|They were lurking around Him, seeking to catch something from His mouth, in order that they might accuse Him.|This translation emphasizes the intentions of the religious leaders who were actively looking for a reason to accuse Jesus, reflecting their hostility and the ongoing tension between Jesus and the authorities.|
