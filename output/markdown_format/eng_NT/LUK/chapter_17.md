|LUK 17:1|He said to His disciples, "It is impossible for offenses not to come, but woe to the one through whom they come!"|This verse emphasizes the inevitability of stumbling blocks in life while highlighting the severity of the consequences for those who cause them. The term 'stumbling blocks' or 'offenses' carries significant weight in both ethical and relational contexts, thus it is crucial to preserve that nuance in translation.|
|LUK 17:2|It would be better for him if a large millstone were hung around his neck and he were thrown into the sea than for him to cause one of these little ones to stumble.|The verse emphasizes the grave consequences of leading others, particularly the vulnerable, into sin or spiritual harm. The phrase 'millstone' signifies the weight of responsibility that comes with guiding others in faith. The comparison to drowning in the sea highlights the severity of this sin.|
|LUK 17:3|Take heed to yourselves. If your brother sins against you, rebuke him; and if he repents, forgive him.|This translation emphasizes personal responsibility in dealing with sin among fellow believers and highlights the importance of both admonition and forgiveness in maintaining unity within the community.|
|LUK 17:4|And if he sins against you seven times in a day, and seven times returns to you, saying, 'I repent,' you must forgive him.|The Greek term 'ἑπτάκις' emphasizes the concept of completeness or perfection in the number seven, reflecting a notion of a full measure of forgiveness expected from a believer. The verb 'ἀφήσεις' indicates a deliberate action of letting go of the offense, which is central to the practice of forgiveness.|
|LUK 17:5|The apostles said to the Lord, 'Increase our faith.'|This verse reflects the disciples' recognition of the need for increased faith, especially in light of the demanding teachings of Jesus. The original Greek uses 'πίστιν' (faith), emphasizing a foundational Christian concept central to both belief and action. The translation captures the disciples' humble request for more faith as a vital part of their discipleship journey.|
|LUK 17:6|And the Lord said, "If you have faith like a mustard seed, you could say to this mulberry tree, 'Be uprooted and planted in the sea,' and it would obey you."|This verse highlights the power of faith, emphasizing that even a small amount can lead to miraculous outcomes. The use of 'mulberry tree' signifies something that appears unmovable, yet through faith, it can be uprooted and replanted. This illustrates the profound potential inherent in genuine belief and trust in God.|
|LUK 17:7|But which of you, having a servant plowing or tending sheep, will say to him when he has come in from the field, 'Come at once and sit down to eat'?|This verse illustrates the expectation of servitude, highlighting the responsibilities of a servant towards their master. It conveys the attitude of humility and duty that is expected, especially in a context where one might hope for immediate reward after labor.|
|LUK 17:8|But will he not rather say to him, ‘Prepare my meal, and gird yourself and serve me until I have eaten and drunk, and afterward you will eat and drink’?|In this verse, the emphasis is on the expectation of a servant to prepare food for the master before tending to his own needs. This reflects a cultural context where service and duty are prioritized. The language used here conveys a sense of duty, responsibility, and the hierarchical nature of servant-master relationships.|
|LUK 17:9|Does he thank the servant because he did what was commanded? I think not.|This verse highlights the expectation of service and duty from a servant, suggesting that fulfilling obligations does not earn special favor from the master. The Greek phrase 'μὴ χάριν ἔχει' implies a lack of gratitude or indebtedness that the master feels towards the servant simply for doing what is required of him.|
|LUK 17:10|So you also, when you have done all that you were commanded, say, ‘We are unworthy servants; we have only done what was our duty.’|This verse emphasizes the attitude of humility that should characterize the servants of God after they have fulfilled their duties. The phrase 'unworthy servants' reflects a mindset of recognizing that their service, no matter how faithful, does not merit special commendation but is merely fulfilling their obligations.|
|LUK 17:11|As He was on His way to Jerusalem, He was passing through the region between Samaria and Galilee.|This translation captures the movement of Jesus towards Jerusalem while highlighting His passage through Samaria and Galilee, emphasizing the geographical and spiritual significance of this journey in the context of His ministry.|
|LUK 17:12|As He entered a certain village, ten men who had leprosy met Him; they stood at a distance.|The verse captures the moment of Jesus entering a village where He encounters ten leprous men, emphasizing their distance as they approach Him due to their condition, which was in accordance with the customs regarding leprosy in that time.|
|LUK 17:13|And they raised their voices, saying, "Jesus, Master, have mercy on us!"|The phrase 'ἐλέησον ἡμᾶς' translates directly to 'have mercy on us,' which reflects a common plea for divine compassion in the New Testament. The urgency and desperation in the cry reflects the lepers' condition and faith in Jesus as their healer.|
|LUK 17:14|When He saw them, He said to them, 'Go and show yourselves to the priests.' And as they went, they were cleansed.|In this verse, the imperative 'Go show yourselves to the priests' emphasizes the importance of following the Levitical laws regarding cleansing.

|LUK 17:16|And he fell on his face at His feet, giving thanks to Him; and he was a Samaritan.|This verse emphasizes the act of falling down in reverence and gratitude, highlighting the Samaritan's response to his healing and his acknowledgement of Jesus' role in it.|
|LUK 17:17|And Jesus answered, "Were not ten cleansed? But where are the nine?"|In this verse, Jesus highlights the significance of gratitude and recognition of His works.

|LUK 17:20|When asked by the Pharisees when the kingdom of God would come, He answered them and said, "The kingdom of God does not come with signs to be observed."|This verse highlights the nature of God's kingdom as not being established through observable signs or public spectacles, but rather as a reality that is spiritual and internal in nature. The term 'observations' reflects the Pharisees' expectation of a visible political kingdom.|
|LUK 17:21|Nor will they say, 'Look, here it is!' or 'There it is!' For behold, the kingdom of God is within you.|The phrase 'within you' emphasizes the internal nature of the kingdom, suggesting that it is not a physical realm to be sought externally but rather a spiritual state found in the hearts of believers.

|LUK 17:22|And He said to the disciples, 'The days are coming when you will long to see one of the days of the Son of Man, but you will not see it.'|This verse emphasizes the longing of the disciples for the presence of Jesus and the anticipation of His return. The phrase 'the days will come' signifies a future expectation, reflecting the human desire to witness significant events, particularly concerning the Son of Man. The translation avoids direct parallels with existing translations to maintain freshness.|
|LUK 17:23|And they will say to you, 'Look, here!' or 'Look, there!' Do not go after them or follow them.|The phrase 'look here' and 'look there' conveys the idea of being misled by false claims of the Messiah's presence. The instruction to not go after them emphasizes the importance of discernment in the face of such deception.|
|LUK 17:24|For just as lightning flashes and shines from one part of the sky to the other, so will it be on the day of the Son of Man.|This verse uses vivid imagery of lightning to describe the visibility and suddenness of the coming of the Son of Man. The comparison to lightning emphasizes that His arrival will be unmistakable and powerful, much like the effect of lightning illuminating the sky.|
|LUK 17:25|But first, He must suffer greatly and be rejected by this generation.|The phrase 'must suffer' conveys the necessity of Jesus' experiences, emphasizing the prophetic nature of his rejection and suffering. The use of 'this generation' underscores the immediate audience's accountability and their response to Jesus' message.|
|LUK 17:26|Just as it was in the days of Noah, so will it be in the days of the Son of Man.|This verse draws a parallel between the days of Noah and the coming of the Son of Man, emphasizing the unpreparedness of people during both periods. The original text highlights the suddenness of the events that transpired during Noah's time and implies a similar unexpectedness regarding the second coming of Christ.|
|LUK 17:27|They were eating and drinking, marrying and being given in marriage, until the day that Noah entered the ark, and the flood came and destroyed them all.|This verse emphasizes the ordinary life of the people before the flood, illustrating their indifference to the coming judgment and serving as a warning for those who do not heed the signs of the times. The Greek terms used reflect daily activities and social customs that showcase the normalcy of life prior to a catastrophic event.|
|LUK 17:28|Likewise, just as it was in the days of Lot: they were eating, drinking, buying, selling, planting, and building.|This translation captures the essence of daily life as it was during the days of Lot, emphasizing the normalcy and complacency of the people just before destruction. The verbs used here highlight everyday activities that reflect human priorities and preoccupations.|
|LUK 17:29|But on the day Lot left Sodom, fire and sulfur rained down from heaven and destroyed them all.|This verse refers to the sudden destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah when Lot escaped, illustrating a moment of divine judgment that parallels future events in eschatology. The use of 'fire' and 'brimstone' is consistent with Old Testament depictions of God's judgment, emphasizing the complete destruction that follows human indifference to divine warning.|
|LUK 17:30|It will be the same on the day when the Son of Man is revealed.|This verse emphasizes the suddenness and unmistakable revelation of the Son of Man, paralleling the catastrophic events in the previous verse about the destruction of Sodom. The original Greek conveys the urgency and importance of the day of revelation, akin to divine judgment.|
|LUK 17:31|On that day, let the one who is on the roof and his belongings in the house not go down to take them away, and likewise, let the one who is in the field not turn back.|In this verse, Jesus emphasizes the urgency and immediacy of the events related to His second coming. The imagery of someone on a rooftop and the agricultural reference serve to illustrate the necessity of leaving behind worldly possessions and concerns without hesitation.|
|LUK 17:32|Remember Lot’s wife.|In this verse, the mention of Lot's wife serves as a poignant reminder of the consequences of looking back and longing for the past instead of pressing forward in faith. This ties into the broader theme of the need for commitment and unwavering faith in the face of impending judgment and the urgency of following God’s call.|
|LUK 17:33|Whoever seeks to preserve their life will lose it, but whoever loses their life will keep it.|This verse reflects a profound teaching on the paradox of life and self-preservation. The use of the terms 'save' and 'lose' emphasizes the counterintuitive nature of discipleship, where true life is found in self-sacrifice rather than in self-preservation.|
|LUK 17:34|I tell you, in that night there will be two people on one bed; one will be taken and the other will be left.|The phrase 'two will be in one bed' suggests a close relationship, implying that the separation in being taken or left occurs despite physical proximity. The words chosen aim to reflect the urgency and seriousness of the moment when one is chosen and the other left behind, paralleling the call to discipleship and sacrifice found in the previous verse.|
|LUK 17:35|Two women will be grinding grain together; one will be taken and the other will be left.|In this verse, the concept of being taken or left is a significant motif in biblical eschatology. The parallel construction emphasizes the suddenness of the event, echoing themes of divine judgment and the dichotomy between the saved and the lost. The word 'taken' suggests a divine selection, while 'left' implies abandonment or separation.|
|LUK 17:36|Two will be in the field; one will be taken and the other will be left behind.|The Greek phrase "δύο ἐν τῷ ἀγρῷ" literally translates to "two in the field." The term "παραληφθήσεται" suggests being taken away or received, while "ἀφεθήσεται" implies being left behind or abandoned. This reflects the theme of separation between two individuals based on their fate, highlighting a moment of divine judgment or selection.|
|LUK 17:37|And they answered Him, 'Where, Lord?' He said to them, 'Wherever the body is, there the eagles will be gathered together.'|The imagery of eagles gathering around a carcass signifies a sense of inevitability regarding the final judgment. This verse captures a profound truth about the nature of where one’s focus is and the consequence of choices made in life. The body represents the state of being, and the eagles symbolize those drawn to that which is spiritually significant or momentous.|
