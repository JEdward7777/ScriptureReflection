|:---------:|-------|-------------------|
|LUK 8:1|Soon afterward, He went through cities and villages, proclaiming and announcing the good news of the kingdom of God; and the twelve were with Him.|The term 'κηρύσσων' is translated as 'proclaiming' to convey the active nature of Jesus’ ministry in a way that emphasizes His public preaching. 'Εὐαγγελιζόμενος' has been rendered as 'announcing the good news,' which captures the essence of the gospel message. This translation maintains the flow and context of Jesus' journey through cities and villages while keeping the original intent clear.|
|LUK 8:2|And certain women who had been healed of evil spirits and diseases were with Him, among whom was Mary called Magdalene, from whom seven demons had gone out.|In this verse, emphasis is placed on the healing ministry of Jesus and the role of women in His following. The use of 'healed' relates to physical and spiritual ailments, reflecting the compassionate nature of Jesus' ministry. The reference to 'seven demons' underscores the significant transformation that Mary Magdalene underwent as a result of Christ's power over evil spirits.|
|LUK 8:3|and Joanna, the wife of Chuza, Herod's steward, and Susanna, and many others who were ministering to Him from their substance.|In this translation, the term 'steward' is used to denote the significant role of Chuza, who was an official, indicating a connection to authority and responsibility. The women are highlighted not only for their support but for their active ministry to Jesus, illustrating their role in His mission.|
|LUK 8:4|And when a great multitude had gathered, and people were coming to Him from every city, He spoke to them by a parable.|The phrase 'ἄγγελος' is used in the context of significant gatherings, highlighting Jesus' approach in addressing crowds through parables. The word 'ὄχλος' suggests a large gathering, indicative of both curiosity and the diverse audience present. This passage emphasizes the teaching method of parables as a key element of Jesus' ministry.|
|LUK 8:5|A sower went out to sow his seed. As he sowed, some fell along the path; it was trampled down, and the birds of the air devoured it.|This verse is part of the Parable of the Sower, illustrating the various outcomes of sowing seeds, which symbolizes the reception of God's word. The words 'sower' and 'seed' are pivotal in this parable, as they convey the message of the Gospel and its reception among people.|
|LUK 8:6|And other seed fell on the rocky ground; as it grew, it withered away because it had no moisture.|This verse highlights the precariousness of growth when it lacks sufficient depth, using agricultural imagery to convey spiritual truths. The metaphor of the seed is central in the teachings of Jesus, relating to receptiveness and growth in faith.|
|LUK 8:7|And another seed fell among the thorns, and as the thorns grew up with it, they choked it out.|This verse discusses the fate of the seed that fell among thorns, indicating that the thorns choked the growth of the seed, preventing it from yielding any fruit. The imagery of thorns represents worldly distractions and cares that inhibit spiritual growth, aligning with the teachings found throughout the Bible regarding the dangers of allowing such distractions to overpower one's faith.|
|LUK 8:8|And another seed fell on the good soil; and growing, it produced a hundredfold. As He said these things, He cried out, "Whoever has ears to hear, let him hear!"|In this verse, the imagery of seed falling on good soil emphasizes the importance of receptiveness to God's word and the fruitful results of faith. The phrase 'whoever has ears to hear, let him hear' is a call to attentiveness and understanding, a common theme in Jesus' teachings.|
|LUK 8:9|And His disciples asked Him, saying, "What does this parable mean?"|In this verse, the disciples are seeking clarity regarding the meaning of the parable that Jesus has just shared. Their question reflects a desire for deeper understanding and the necessity of seeking knowledge from the teacher, which is a theme seen throughout the Gospels.|
|LUK 8:10|He said, "To you it has been granted to know the mysteries of the kingdom of God, but to the others it is given in parables, so that seeing they may not see, and hearing they may not understand."|In this verse, Jesus emphasizes the distinction between His disciples and the rest of the people regarding their understanding of the mysteries of God's kingdom. The phrase 'mysteries of the kingdom' implies profound truths that are revealed to believers, while the use of parables serves to obscure meaning from those who do not believe. This distinction is crucial in understanding Jesus' teaching methods and the response of different audiences.|
|LUK 8:11|Now this is the parable: The seed is the word of God.|In this verse, the metaphor of 'seed' is used to represent the message of God, indicating that the word of God has the potential to grow and bear fruit in the hearts of believers. The choice of the word 'sower' aligns with agricultural themes common in biblical literature, emphasizing the importance of the message being planted in receptive hearts.|
|LUK 8:12|But those along the path are the ones who hear; then the devil comes and takes away the word from their hearts, so that they may not believe and be saved.|In this translation, emphasis is placed on the act of the devil removing the word from the hearts of the hearers. The choice of 'hearts' instead of 'minds' aligns with the original Greek term 'καρδίας,' which implies a deeper emotional and spiritual receptivity. The phrase 'so that they may not believe and be saved' underscores the purpose behind the devil's action, making it clear that it leads to the ultimate consequence of losing salvation.|
|LUK 8:13|But those on the rock are those who, when they hear the word, receive it with joy; yet they have no root, who believe for a while but in the time of testing fall away.|This verse emphasizes the superficial acceptance of the word among those who initially receive it with joy but lack the depth to endure trials. The translation aims to capture the nuances of faith that is temporary and the impact of trials on that faith.|
|LUK 8:14|And what fell among thorns, these are the ones who hear, but as they go on their way, they are choked by the cares, riches, and pleasures of life, and their fruit does not mature.|This verse speaks about the response of individuals who hear the word but become distracted by life's concerns, wealth, and pleasures, ultimately leading to unfruitfulness. The Greek word 'συμπνίγονται' conveys the idea of being choked or suffocated, indicating that these distractions severely hinder spiritual growth and productivity.|
|LUK 8:15|But the ones that fell on the good soil, these are the ones who, having heard the word with a noble and good heart, hold it fast and bear fruit with patience.|This translation focuses on the positive attributes of those who receive the word of God. The original Greek emphasizes the good heart that retains the message and bears fruit with patience, contrasting with the previous verses that describe the negative impacts of the cares of life. The idea of a good heart is reflected in the use of 'good ground' and 'fruitfulness' as central themes.|
|LUK 8:16|No one, after lighting a lamp, covers it with a container or puts it under a bed; instead, he puts it on a lampstand so that those who enter may see the light.|In this verse, the imagery of light and the lamp is significant in understanding the role of revelation and the responsibility that comes with it. The 'lamp' symbolizes knowledge or truth that must be shared openly rather than hidden. The use of the term 'candlestick' emphasizes the visibility and accessibility of this light to others, signifying the purpose of believers to spread the teachings they have received.|
|LUK 8:17|For nothing is concealed that will not be made evident, nor is anything hidden that will not come to light.|This verse emphasizes the inevitability of truth coming to light and that no hidden thing can remain concealed indefinitely. The use of the words "hidden" and "revealed" reflects a theme found throughout scripture regarding the revelation of God’s truth and the exposure of human actions.|
|LUK 8:18|Take care then how you listen; for to the one who has, more will be given, but from the one who does not have, even what he thinks he has will be taken away.|This verse emphasizes the importance of actively listening and understanding spiritual truths. The concept of receiving and losing is contrasted, highlighting that spiritual insight and understanding can grow or diminish based on one’s engagement and perception.|
|LUK 8:19|Then his mother and his brothers came to him, but they were unable to reach him because of the crowd.|The original Greek text expresses a situation where Jesus' family seeks him but cannot reach him due to the crowd. The term 'οὐκ ἠδύναντο' suggests an inability, emphasizing the barriers that prevent them from connecting with Jesus in this moment. This translation aims to capture the urgency and emotional weight of their intent to see him, while also reflecting the physical obstacle they encounter.|
|LUK 8:20|And it was reported to him, saying, "Your mother and your brothers are standing outside, desiring to see you."|This verse emphasizes the physical separation of Jesus from his family due to the crowd, highlighting the themes of familial relationships and the challenges of discipleship. The word 'stood' (ἑστήκασιν) reflects a state of presence and intention to engage with Jesus, while 'to see you' (ἰδεῖν σε) captures both a physical and metaphorical desire for connection with Him.|
|LUK 8:21|But he answered them, "My mother and my brothers are those who hear the word of God and put it into practice."|In this verse, Jesus redefines familial relationships, emphasizing spiritual bonds over biological ones. The focus is on those who listen to and obey God's word, indicating that true kinship is found in spiritual obedience rather than earthly ties.|
|LUK 8:22|One day, Jesus said to his disciples, "Let us cross over to the other side of the lake." So they got into the boat and set out.|In this verse, the phrase 'let us go over to the other side' conveys Jesus' direction to his disciples, emphasizing both leadership and the intention of travel across the body of water. The wording 'the lake' has been translated as 'the lake' rather than 'the sea' to reflect the geographic context accurately, as it often refers to the Sea of Galilee.|
|LUK 8:23|But while they were sailing, He fell asleep. And a fierce windstorm swept down on the lake, and they were being swamped and were in great danger.|The original text highlights the distress of the disciples as a storm brews while Jesus is asleep in the boat.

And He arose and rebuked the wind and the raging water, and they ceased, and there was a calm.|This verse depicts the power of Jesus over nature, emphasizing His authority and the calm that follows His command. The original Greek terms for 'wake' and 'rebuke' highlight His active role in confronting chaos.|
|LUK 8:25|He said to them, "Where is your faith?" They were afraid and amazed, and they said to one another, "Who then is this, that he commands even the winds and the water, and they obey him?"|In this translation, the key themes of faith, fear, and the authority of Jesus over nature are emphasized. The term for 'faith' (πίστις) is contrasted with the disciples' fear, highlighting the challenge of maintaining faith in fearful circumstances. The question posed by Jesus underscores the importance of faith in the face of adversity.|
|LUK 8:26|And they sailed to the region of the Gadarenes, which is across from Galilee.|The term 'Gadarenes' is consistent with historical and geographical references in the New Testament, linking the area to the broader region known as the Decapolis, emphasizing Jesus' ministry across different cultures and areas.|
|LUK 8:27|And as He stepped onto the land, a man from the city met Him who was possessed by demons for a long time. He wore no clothes and did not live in a house, but among the tombs.|This verse illustrates the encounter of Jesus with a man possessed by demons, highlighting his isolation and the severe condition he lived in. The use of the word 'tombs' emphasizes the despair and spiritual death of the man, while 'unclean' refers to his demonic possession. The phrase 'for many years' indicates the prolonged suffering and perhaps a lack of help he had experienced before this encounter with Jesus.|
|LUK 8:28|When he saw Jesus, he cried out and fell down before Him, shouting with a loud voice, "What do I have to do with You, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? I beg You, do not torment me!"|In this verse, the demon-possessed man recognizes Jesus and addresses Him with titles that denote authority and divinity. The phrase 'What do I have to do with you?' is an expression of distress or conflict, indicating a recognition of the power of Jesus over the demonic realm. The translation aims to capture the urgency and fear expressed by the man possessed by demons.|

The use of 'unclean spirit' emphasizes the moral and spiritual impurity, while the details of the man's condition highlight the severity of his affliction and the power of Jesus to restore. The verb 'exitein' implies a forceful departure, emphasizing the authority Jesus holds over demonic forces.|
|LUK 8:30|Jesus asked him, "What is your name?" He replied, "Legion," because many demons had entered into him.|In this verse, the emphasis is on the identity and nature of the demon possessing the man, referred to as 'Legion', which signifies not only a multitude but also a powerful presence. The dialogue emphasizes the recognition of authority that Jesus holds over the demonic realm, as well as the need for clarity in naming the issue at hand, which in this case, is the multitude of demons present.|

This translation reflects the plea of the demons not to be cast into this abyss, highlighting their fear of being rendered powerless and separated from their current dominion.|
|LUK 8:32|Now there was a large herd of pigs feeding on the hillside. And they begged Him to let them go into them; and He gave them permission.|The term 'herd' (ἀγέλη) and 'swine' (χοῖροι) are key elements in this verse, representing not just livestock but the context of the events surrounding the demoniac. The plea for permission (παρεκάλουν... ἐπιτρέψῃ) shows the desperation of the demons, highlighting the authority of Jesus even over unclean spirits.|
|LUK 8:33|Then the demons came out from the man and entered the pigs; and the herd rushed down the steep bank into the lake and was drowned.|This verse captures the moment when the demons leave the man and enter the pigs, causing the herd to rush into the lake. The original Greek emphasizes the action of the herd (ἀγέλη) moving forcefully (ὥρμησεν) down the cliff into the water. The translation reflects the urgency and chaos of the situation, remaining faithful to the source text while presenting it clearly in English.|
|LUK 8:34|When the herdsmen saw what had happened, they fled and reported it in the city and in the countryside.|In this verse, the reaction of the herdsmen to the miraculous event underscores their fear and the urgency to inform others about what happened. The terms used here reflect a sense of alarm and a quick response to a dramatic situation.|
|LUK 8:35|So they went out to see what had happened, and they came to Jesus and found the man from whom the demons had gone out, sitting at Jesus' feet, clothed and in his right mind; and they were afraid.|This verse emphasizes the transformative power of Jesus over the man who had been possessed, showcasing both the man's restored state and the fear of those who witnessed this miracle. The Greek term 'ἱματισμένον' (clothed) and 'σωφρονοῦντα' (in his right mind) are key to understanding the significance of this moment, illustrating not only physical restoration but also mental clarity as a result of Jesus' intervention.|
|LUK 8:36|And those who had seen it reported to them how the man who had been possessed by demons was saved.|In this verse, the emphasis is on the act of reporting and witnessing a miraculous event. The term 'ἀπήγγειλαν' is a form of communication that highlights the testimony of those who witnessed the deliverance of the demon-possessed man. This captures the essence of evangelism where those who have seen the work of Christ are compelled to share it with others.|
|LUK 8:37|And all the people of the surrounding region of the Gadarenes asked Him to depart from them, for they were seized with great fear. So He got into the boat and returned.|This verse illustrates the fear and rejection the people of Gadara felt towards Jesus after witnessing the miraculous event of the demon-possessed man. The use of 'fear' reflects a profound emotional response to divine power that was misinterpreted as a threat. Their request for Jesus to leave highlights the tension between divine authority and human apprehension.|
|LUK 8:38|The man from whom the demons had gone out begged to stay with Him, but Jesus sent him away, saying,|In this verse, the plea of the man reflects a deep desire for companionship with Jesus after his liberation from demonic possession.

|LUK 8:44|She approached from behind and touched the fringe of his garment, and immediately her bleeding stopped.|In this verse, the phrase 'touched the fringe of his garment' is significant in the cultural context of the time, as the hem of a Jewish garment was a place of great religious symbolism. The woman's act of reaching out conveys her desperation and faith, believing that even the slightest contact would lead to her healing.|
|LUK 8:45|And Jesus said, "Who touched me?" When they all denied it, Peter and those with him said, "Master, the crowds surround you and press in on you, and yet you ask, 'Who touched me?'"|In this verse, Jesus directly engages with the crowd to identify the person who has touched him, highlighting the personal interaction and the significance of faith.

Go in peace."|In this verse, the use of 'thou daughter' emphasizes the personal relationship and compassion Jesus shows toward the woman.

The phrase 'do not trouble the teacher' signifies the belief that Jesus can still provide help despite the apparent hopelessness of the situation.|
|LUK 8:50|But Jesus, hearing this, answered him, saying, 'Do not be afraid; only believe, and she will be made well.'|The verse conveys Jesus’ reassurance to the ruler regarding the dire situation of his daughter, emphasizing the necessity of faith. The phrase 'Do not fear; only believe' is a common theme in Jesus’ teachings, reflecting the core message of trust in God's power.|
|LUK 8:51|And when He entered the house, He permitted no one to go in except Peter, John, and James, along with the father and mother of the girl.|This verse emphasizes the selectivity of Jesus' inner circle when entering the house, which conveys the significance of the event occurring. The names mentioned reflect the close relationship Jesus had with his disciples, particularly Peter, James, and John, who often accompanied Him during pivotal moments. Their presence is also a sign of trust and a direct involvement in the miracle about to take place.|
|LUK 8:52|And all were weeping and mourning for her. But He said, 'Do not weep; she is not dead, but sleeping.'|In this verse, Jesus addresses the mourners, contrasting their perception of death with His understanding of the girl's condition, indicating that she is merely asleep. The choice of the word 'sleeping' implies a temporary state, reflecting a common biblical metaphor for death in the context of resurrection and hope.|
|LUK 8:53|And they mocked Him, knowing that she was dead.|This verse captures the scornful attitude of the mourners who did not understand the nature of Jesus' declaration regarding the girl. The phrase 'they laughed at Him' highlights their disbelief in His words, which were rooted in their assumption that death was final. The term 'dead' (ἀπέθανεν) is used to signify the certainty of death, contrasting with Jesus' earlier statement about sleep, suggesting a temporary state before restoration.|
|LUK 8:54|But He took her by the hand and called, saying, "Child, arise!"|This verse illustrates the authority of Jesus over death and His ability to restore life. The term 'raise' (ἐγείρω) signifies not just awakening from sleep but a powerful act of resurrection, showing His divine capability. The direct address to the girl emphasizes a personal connection and command. The act of taking her by the hand conveys compassion and tenderness.|
|LUK 8:55|And her spirit returned, and she immediately arose. And He commanded that she be given something to eat.|This verse illustrates the power of Jesus' command, where He restores life by calling the girl back from death. The phrasing 'the spirit returned' emphasizes the divine authority that Jesus holds over life and death.|
|LUK 8:56|And her parents were astonished. But He instructed them to tell no one what had happened.|In this verse, the emphasis is on the astonishment of the parents at the miraculous event and the directive from Jesus not to disclose what had occurred. This captures the significance of silence in the presence of divine miracles and the sacredness of the event.|
