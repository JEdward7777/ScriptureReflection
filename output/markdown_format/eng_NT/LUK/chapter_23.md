|LUK 23:3|Then Pilate asked Him, 'Are You the King of the Jews?' Jesus answered him, 'You say so.'|This translation captures the dialogue between Pilate and Jesus, emphasizing the questioning nature of Pilate and the concise reply of Jesus.

The phrase 'starting from Galilee' connects Jesus' ministry with the broader context of His impact on the region.|
|LUK 23:6|Upon hearing this, Pilate asked if the man was from Galilee.|The term 'Galilee' refers to the region where Jesus was raised and began His ministry, often highlighting His humble origins and the prejudices of those who saw Galileans as less significant than Judeans.

|LUK 23:7|And realizing that He was under the authority of Herod, he sent Him back to Herod, for he was also in Jerusalem during those days.|This verse illustrates the political dynamics of the time, showcasing the relationship between Pilate and Herod. The phrase 'from the authority of Herod' refers to Jesus being sent to Herod due to his Galilean origin, emphasizing the jurisdictional boundaries of Roman authority. The translation aims to capture the original meaning without direct borrowing from existing versions.|
|LUK 23:8|When Herod saw Jesus, he was greatly pleased; for he had long wanted to see Him because he had heard so many things about Him, and he hoped to see some miracle performed by Him.|In this verse, Herod expresses joy upon seeing Jesus, showing his curiosity and interest in Him, likely influenced by the numerous reports he had heard about Jesus' actions and miracles. The term 'sign' (σημεῖον) is significant, denoting the expectation of miraculous proof of Jesus’ authority or divinity.|
|LUK 23:9|He questioned Him with probing words, but Jesus gave him no answer.|The phrase 'ἐν λόγοις ἱκανοῖς' can be translated as 'in sufficient words' or 'with persuasive words', implying that Herod was questioning Jesus in a way intended to elicit a substantial response or to test His wisdom.

The wording is carefully chosen to maintain the gravity of the judicial context and Pilate's role as a governor evaluating the charges. The phrase 'I find no fault' reflects the judicial examination while 'the man' refers to Jesus in a direct but impersonal manner, reinforcing the sense of injustice surrounding the trial.|
|LUK 23:15|But neither did Herod, for I sent you to him, and behold, he has found nothing deserving of death in Him.|This verse conveys the message from Herod that Jesus was not found guilty of any crime deserving of death. It emphasizes the innocence of Jesus in the eyes of the rulers, reinforcing the overall theme of injustice surrounding His trial.|
|LUK 23:16|Therefore, I will chastise him and release him.|The term 'αὐτὸν' directly refers to Jesus, emphasizing the personal aspect of His suffering.

The verb 'pressed' ('κατίσχυον') highlights the power struggle in the trial of Jesus.|
|LUK 23:24|So Pilate decided that their request should be granted.|In this verse, the focus is on Pilate's response to the crowd's demands. The term 'aithma' (αἴτημα) is crucial here, as it signifies a request or demand that has been put forward by the people, illustrating their determination. The verb 'epēkrine' (ἐπέκρινε) implies an authoritative decision made by Pilate, who, despite his reservations, concedes to the pressure of the crowd.|
|LUK 23:25|So he released to them Barabbas, the one who had been imprisoned for insurrection and murder, whom they had asked for; but he handed Jesus over to their will.|In this verse, the contrast between Barabbas, who was imprisoned for insurrection and murder, and Jesus, who was delivered up according to the will of the people, is significant.

This reflects a deeper teaching on the nature of grief and the forthcoming trials that await them, indicating a future that warrants concern beyond His own suffering.|
|LUK 23:29|For behold, the days are coming when they will say, 'Blessed are the barren and the wombs that never bore, and the breasts that never nursed.'|In this verse, Jesus highlights the tragic circumstances that will befall those who are unable to bear children during times of great suffering.
