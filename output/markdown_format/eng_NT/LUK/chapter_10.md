The second part highlights the potential rejection of that peace and its return to the messengers, illustrating the conditional nature of this blessing.|

Nevertheless, know this: the kingdom of God has drawn near to you.|In this verse, Jesus is instructing His disciples on how to respond to towns that reject their message.

|LUK 10:12|But I tell you, it will be more bearable for Sodom on that day than for that city.|In this verse, the contrast is being drawn between the judgment faced by cities like Sodom and that faced by the specific town mentioned prior in the passage.

|LUK 10:16|Whoever listens to you listens to me, and whoever disregards you disregards me; and the one who disregards me disregards the one who sent me.|In this verse, Jesus emphasizes the connection between his disciples and himself.

The structure of the Greek text shows a contrast between those who longed to see and hear, and those who have been given that privilege. It reflects the fulfillment of God's promises and the special insight granted to the disciples through Jesus' ministry.|
|LUK 10:25|And behold, a certain lawyer stood up, testing him, and saying, "Teacher, what must I do to inherit eternal life?"|This verse is pivotal as it shows a lawyer testing Jesus with a question about eternal life, encapsulating the theme of the inquiry into the requirements of inheriting eternal life, a recurring topic throughout the New Testament.|
|LUK 10:26|But He said to him, 'What is written in the Law? How do you read it?'|In this verse, Jesus responds to the lawyer's question by directing him back to the law, emphasizing the importance of understanding and interpreting Scripture correctly. The term 'law' (νόμος) is central to Jewish teaching and represents God's commands, while 'read' (ἀναγινώσκω) implies a deeper comprehension beyond mere reading. The question invites reflection on one's own understanding of the law's demands.|

|LUK 10:30|In response, Jesus said, 'A certain man was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho, and he fell among robbers, who stripped him of his clothes, beat him, and departed, leaving him half dead.'|In this verse, the concept of descent from Jerusalem to Jericho illustrates a journey from a place of holiness to one of danger, emphasizing the vulnerability of the traveler.

|LUK 10:31|But by chance a certain priest was going down that road, and when he saw him, he passed by on the other side.|The original Greek term 'κατὰ συγκυρίαν' suggests an event occurring by coincidence or circumstance. The term 'ἱερεύς' refers specifically to a priest, indicating a person of religious authority. The phrase 'ἀντιπαρῆλθεν' implies deliberately passing by, which could indicate a failure of duty or compassion in this context.|
|LUK 10:32|Likewise, a Levite, when he came to the place and saw him, passed by on the other side.|In this verse, the Levite, like the priest, encounters the wounded man but chooses to pass by without helping.

Then he placed him on his own animal and brought him to an inn, caring for him.|In this verse, the act of tending to the wounds with oil and wine signifies not only a physical healing but also compassion and care. The choice of 'beast' suggests a personal involvement in the man's recovery, emphasizing the Samaritan's selflessness and commitment to helping a stranger.|
|LUK 10:35|And the next day, he took out two denarii and gave them to the innkeeper, saying, 'Take care of him, and whatever more you may need to spend, I will repay you when I come back.'|In this translation, I have emphasized the care and commitment shown by the Samaritan.
