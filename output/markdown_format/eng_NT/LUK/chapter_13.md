|LUK 13:6|He spoke this parable: A certain man had a fig tree planted in his vineyard, and he came seeking fruit on it and found none.|This verse uses the metaphor of a fig tree in a vineyard, symbolizing the expectation of fruitfulness from God's people. The imagery reflects the agricultural context of Jesus’ parables and illustrates the consequences of unfruitfulness in one's spiritual life.|
|LUK 13:7|So he said to the vineyard keeper, 'Look, for three years I have come seeking fruit on this fig tree and find none. Cut it down; why should it use up the ground?'|In this verse, the imagery of the fig tree and its lack of fruit is central to the message, emphasizing the expectation of productivity and the consequences of barrenness. The use of 'three years' signifies a period of grace and patience, reflecting God's expectation for repentance and growth. The call to cut down the tree highlights the urgency of accountability in spiritual matters.|
|LUK 13:8|But he answered him, 'Sir, let it alone this year also, until I dig around it and put manure on it.'|In this verse, the request to give the fig tree another year reflects patience and the hope for future fruitfulness. The phrase 'dig around it and put on manure' indicates the gardener's commitment to nurturing and fostering growth, suggesting that sometimes additional care and time are necessary for development.|
|LUK 13:9|And if it bears fruit next year, well and good; but if not, you can cut it down.'|In this verse, the emphasis is on the expectation of fruit from the tree.

Does not each of you on the Sabbath untie his ox or his donkey from the stall and lead it away to water it?|In this verse, Jesus addresses the hypocrisy of the religious leaders who prioritize their interpretations of the law over compassion and care for those in need. The use of the term 'hypocrite' underscores the inconsistency in their practices, particularly regarding the Sabbath. The comparison made to the care of animals serves to highlight the value of human welfare over rigid adherence to rules.|

The expression 'blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord' is a quotation from Psalm 118:26, used during the Triumphal Entry of Jesus into Jerusalem.
