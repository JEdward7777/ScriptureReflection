|:---------:|-------|-------------------|
|LUK 12:1|As the crowds gathered in thousands, pressing upon one another, Jesus began to speak first to His disciples, saying, "Beware of the leaven of the Pharisees, which is hypocrisy."|This verse serves as a warning from Jesus to His disciples about the influence of the Pharisees. The term 'leaven' is a metaphor for their teachings and hypocrisy, which can permeate and corrupt. The choice of 'hypocrisy' reflects the deceitful nature of their conduct.|
|LUK 12:2|For there is nothing concealed that will not be revealed, nor hidden that will not be known.|This verse emphasizes the certainty that all hidden things will ultimately be disclosed. It speaks to the theme of transparency and accountability before God, consistent with the teachings of Jesus on authenticity and the dangers of hypocrisy.|
|LUK 12:3|Therefore, whatever you have said in the darkness will be heard in the light, and what you have whispered in private rooms will be proclaimed from the rooftops.|This translation aims to reflect the original Greek nuances, emphasizing the contrast between what is spoken in secrecy and what will be declared openly. The terms for 'darkness' and 'light' signify not only physical spaces but also moral and spiritual revelation.|
|LUK 12:4|I say to you, My friends, do not fear those who can kill the body, and after that have no more they can do.|In this verse, Jesus is addressing His followers, emphasizing the futility of fearing those who can only harm the body, while drawing attention to the greater significance of the soul. The Greek phrase 'ἀποκτεννόντων τὸ σῶμα' translates directly to 'those killing the body,' underscoring the limited power of human adversaries. The contrast between bodily harm and the fate of the soul highlights the Christian belief in eternal life and the authority of God over life and death.|
|LUK 12:5|But I will show you whom you should fear: fear him who, after he has killed, has authority to throw you into hell. Yes, I tell you, fear him!|In this verse, Jesus emphasizes the importance of fearing God, who has authority over eternal judgment, rather than those who can only affect physical life. The term 'Gehenna' is used here to denote a place of final judgment, aligning with the broader biblical theme of divine authority over life and death.|
|LUK 12:6|Are not five sparrows sold for two pennies? And not one of them is forgotten before God.|In this verse, the sparrows symbolize God's providence and care over even the smallest and seemingly insignificant creatures. The use of the term "two assaria" references the low monetary value of the sparrows, emphasizing the point that even these inexpensive birds are important to God. The phrase 'not one of them is forgotten' reflects the deep assurance of God's awareness and concern for His creation.|
|LUK 12:7|But even the very hairs of your head are all counted. Therefore, do not fear; you are of more value than many sparrows.|In this translation, the emphasis is placed on the intimate care and attention that God gives to His creation, particularly to individuals. The original text indicates not only the value of individuals in God's eyes but also His meticulous knowledge of them, down to the very hairs on their heads. The phrase 'do not fear' is used to encourage believers, reinforcing the assurance that they are valued beyond measure.|
|LUK 12:8|I tell you this: everyone who acknowledges Me before others, the Son of Man will also acknowledge them before the angels of God.|This verse emphasizes the importance of openly acknowledging Jesus as Lord before others. The concept of confession in the New Testament often relates to one's faith and witness, establishing a direct connection between public confession and divine acknowledgment.|
|LUK 12:9|But the one who denies Me in front of people will be denied in front of the angels of God.|This verse emphasizes the significance of public acknowledgment of faith in Christ and the consequences of denial. The term 'deny' is crucial as it denotes a rejection or disowning of Jesus, which carries weight in the context of eternal judgment and divine recognition.|
|LUK 12:10|And everyone who speaks a word against the Son of Man will be forgiven; but whoever speaks blasphemy against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven.|This verse addresses the gravity of speaking against the Holy Spirit as opposed to speaking against the Son of Man. The structure emphasizes the forgiveness available through Christ, contrasting it with the severe consequences of blaspheming the Holy Spirit, reflecting a core belief in the sacredness of the Spirit's work in the world.|
|LUK 12:11|When they bring you before the synagogues, the rulers, and the authorities, do not worry about how or what you should defend yourselves or what you should say.|This verse emphasizes the promise of divine guidance during times of persecution. The instruction not to worry about what to say reflects a broader biblical theme of reliance on God during trials. The original Greek term 'μεριμνᾶτε' indicates a deep anxiety or concern, which is countered by the assurance that the Holy Spirit will provide the necessary words in those challenging moments.|
|LUK 12:12|For the Holy Spirit will teach you in that very hour what you ought to say.|This verse emphasizes the divine assistance provided by the Holy Spirit during moments of challenge or defense, encouraging believers to rely on His guidance in critical times. The phrase 'in that hour' underscores the immediacy and relevance of the Holy Spirit's instruction during trials.|
|LUK 12:13|Then someone from the crowd said to Him, "Teacher, tell my brother to divide the inheritance with me."|In this verse, a man from the crowd asks Jesus to intervene in a dispute regarding inheritance. The word 'κληρονομίαν' (inheritance) is pivotal as it highlights issues of greed and brotherly relations, setting a tone for Jesus' subsequent teaching on possessions and priorities in life.|
|LUK 12:14|But He said to him, "Man, who appointed me to be a judge or divider over you?"|The phrase 'Who made me a judge or an arbiter over you?' indicates a clear distinction between Christ’s spiritual authority and the worldly issues concerning material wealth. The term 'judge' refers to a legal adjudicator, while 'arbiter' suggests one who mediates disputes, particularly in the context of inheritance. The focus is on spiritual rather than material matters.|
|LUK 12:15|And He said to them, "Take heed and beware of all greed, for one's life does not consist in the abundance of the things he possesses."|In this verse, Jesus warns against greed and emphasizes that life does not consist in the abundance of possessions. The Greek word for 'greed' (πλεονεξία) implies a strong desire to have more, which can lead to neglecting the true essence of life. The phrase 'not in the abundance' contrasts the idea of material wealth with the spiritual significance of life.|
|LUK 12:16|And He told them a parable, saying: "The land of a certain rich man produced abundantly."|In this verse, the emphasis is on a rich man whose land produced an abundant harvest. The use of the term 'abundance' directly relates to the previous warning against greed, establishing a contrast between wealth and true life fulfillment. The narrative sets the stage for the parable that follows, highlighting the pitfalls of placing value solely on material possessions.|
|LUK 12:17|And he pondered within himself, saying, ‘What shall I do, for I have no place to store my harvest?’|The phrase 'what shall I do' reflects a moment of introspection and concern over material wealth, while 'where shall I store' highlights a focus on earthly possessions rather than spiritual matters. This verse conveys the tension between earthly abundance and spiritual emptiness, echoing themes in other biblical texts about the fleeting nature of life and the futility of wealth.|
|LUK 12:18|And he said, ‘This is what I will do: I will tear down my barns and build larger ones, and there I will store all my grain and my goods.'|This verse captures the essence of human ambition and the inclination to secure material wealth. The phrases used are intentionally straightforward to convey the character's desire to gather and secure his possessions. 'Storehouses' is used to denote a larger scale of accumulation, reflecting the man's intent to amass his goods for future security, in contrast to the teachings on humility and dependence on God for provision.|
|LUK 12:19|And I will say to my soul, ‘Soul, you have ample goods laid up for many years; relax, eat, drink, and be merry.’|This verse reflects the human desire for security and enjoyment in life, illustrating the tendency to seek rest and pleasure from earthly possessions. The use of the word 'soul' indicates a deeper, almost existential conversation about satisfaction and rest in life. The translation retains a conversational tone to reflect the nature of the original text.|
|LUK 12:20|But God said to him, 'Fool, this very night your soul will be demanded of you. And the things you have prepared, whose will they be?'|In this verse, God addresses the man directly, calling him 'fool' for his misguided trust in material wealth and lack of preparedness for his own mortality. The phrase 'this night your soul is required of you' highlights the urgency and unpredictability of life, while the question at the end prompts reflection on the value of earthly possessions compared to spiritual readiness.|
|LUK 12:21|So it is with the one who treasures up riches for himself and is not rich toward God.|The term 'treasuring up' reflects a selfish accumulation of wealth that focuses solely on personal gain, contrasting sharply with the idea of being rich toward God. The use of 'God' emphasizes the divine relationship that should be prioritized over material possessions.|
|LUK 12:22|Then He said to His disciples, "For this reason I tell you, do not be anxious about your life, what you will eat; nor about your body, what you will wear."|This translation emphasizes the instruction not to worry about life essentials, using simple language to convey Jesus' teaching on trusting in God's provision.|
|LUK 12:23|For life is more than food, and the body is more than clothing.|In this verse, Jesus emphasizes the greater significance of life and the body compared to food and clothing. The terms 'life' (ψυχὴ) and 'body' (σῶμα) are used to convey the idea that one's essence and physical existence are far more important than mere physical sustenance and attire. This reflects the biblical theme of trusting God for one's needs, as seen in parallel verses.|
|LUK 12:24|Consider the ravens: they do not sow or reap; they have no storeroom or barn, yet God feeds them. How much more valuable are you than birds!|This verse emphasizes God's providential care for His creation, using the example of ravens, which do not engage in agricultural practices but are still sustained by Him. The rhetorical question serves to highlight the greater value of human beings in comparison to birds, reinforcing the message of trust in God's provision.|
|LUK 12:25|And which of you by worrying can add a single hour to his life?|In this translation, the emphasis is on the futility of worry in relation to the length of one's life. The phrase 'add to his stature' has been interpreted as an expression of life span or age, making it relevant to the concept of worry about life's duration.|
|LUK 12:26|If then you are not able to do even the smallest thing, why are you anxious about the rest?|This verse emphasizes the futility of worrying, especially about matters beyond one's control. It reflects the theme of reliance on God rather than human efforts in achieving security or peace.|
|LUK 12:27|Consider the lilies, how they grow: they do not labor nor spin; yet I tell you, not even Solomon in all his splendor was clothed like one of these.|This verse emphasizes God's provision and care for creation, using the imagery of lilies to contrast with human worry. The comparison to Solomon highlights the extraordinary beauty bestowed by God without effort. This fresh translation seeks to capture the essence of Jesus' teaching on trust in God's provision without direct replication of existing versions.|
|LUK 12:28|But if God clothes the grass of the field, which is here today and tomorrow is thrown into the oven, how much more will He clothe you, O you of little faith?|In this verse, Jesus emphasizes God's care for His creation, contrasting the temporary nature of the grass with the eternal value of His followers. The phrase 'O you of little faith' indicates a gentle admonition to trust in God’s provision more fully.|
|LUK 12:29|And you, do not seek what you will eat or what you will drink, and do not let your minds be filled with anxiety.|This verse emphasizes the need for believers to trust in God for their needs, rather than being anxious or preoccupied with material concerns. The term 'meeteorizesthe' implies a state of anxiety or worry that distracts from faith in God’s provision. This fresh translation aims to convey that trust and peace in God supersedes concerns about daily sustenance.|
|LUK 12:30|For all the nations of the world seek after these things, and your Father knows that you need them.|This translation emphasizes the contrast between the desires of the nations and the understanding and provision of the Father for His children. The word 'desire' or 'long for' indicates a deep need, which is contrasted with the assurance given by God to provide for His children.|
|LUK 12:31|But seek the kingdom of God, and all these things will be given to you as well.|The phrase 'seek the kingdom of God' emphasizes the prioritization of God's reign and righteousness in the life of the believer. The promise that 'all these things will be added to you' reinforces God's provision and care for those who prioritize His kingdom over earthly concerns.|
|LUK 12:32|Do not be afraid, little flock, for your Father has been pleased to give you the kingdom.|In this verse, Jesus is reassuring His followers, referring to them as a 'little flock,' emphasizing their vulnerability and the Father's gracious choice to give them the kingdom. The term 'little flock' conveys both a sense of tenderness and a reminder of the divine care they receive.|
|LUK 12:33|Sell your possessions and give to the needy. Provide yourselves with money bags that do not grow old, a treasure in the heavens that does not fail, where no thief approaches and no moth destroys.|This verse emphasizes the act of selling one's possessions as a way of encouraging charity and generosity, illustrating a deeper spiritual principle of storing up eternal treasures in heaven rather than earthly wealth. The language evokes themes of care for the needy and the impermanence of worldly goods, which aligns with the teachings of Jesus on the value of generosity and the transient nature of material possessions.|
|LUK 12:34|For where your treasure is, there your heart will also be.|This verse highlights the intrinsic connection between our values and desires. It emphasizes that where we place our treasure directly influences our heart's affections and priorities.|
|LUK 12:35|Let your waists be girded and your lamps burning; |The phrase "let your loins be girded" carries a connotation of readiness and preparation.

The mention of the 'second' and 'third' watches suggests that the time of the master's return may be unexpected, requiring constant alertness from the servants.|

The original Greek suggests a sense of urgency and responsibility for the master of the house to be alert.

|LUK 12:43|Blessed is that servant whom his master will find doing so when he comes.|This translation emphasizes the blessing of the servant who is found diligently performing his duties when the master returns.
