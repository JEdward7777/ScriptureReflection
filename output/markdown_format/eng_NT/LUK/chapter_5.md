| Reference | Verse | Translation Notes |
|:---------:|-------|-------------------|
|LUK 5:1|And it came to pass, as the crowd pressed around Him to hear the word of God, that He stood by the Lake of Gennesaret.|The translation aims to capture the essence of the original Greek while providing clarity in contemporary English. 'Pressing around Him' is used to depict the eagerness of the crowd. The reference to the 'Lake of Gennesaret' aligns with other translations but remains consistent in context.|
|LUK 5:2|And He saw two boats standing by the lake, but the fishermen had gone out of them and were washing their nets.|The Greek term for 'boats' (πλοῖα) refers to fishing vessels typical of the region, while 'fishermen' (ἁλιεῖς) emphasizes the profession of those involved. The action of 'washing the nets' indicates a post-catch activity common among fishermen. The term 'lake' corresponds to the Sea of Gennesaret, reflecting its freshwater characteristics.|
|LUK 5:3|Getting into one of the boats, which belonged to Simon, He asked him to put out a little from the land. And sitting down, He taught the people from the boat.|This verse describes the moment Jesus steps into Simon Peter's boat and requests to be pushed out slightly from the shore. It reflects Jesus' teaching method, using the water to amplify His voice to the crowd.|
|LUK 5:4|When He had finished speaking, He said to Simon, "Put out into the deep water and let down your nets for a catch."|In this verse, Jesus instructs Simon Peter to launch out into the deep and let down his nets for a catch. This directive emphasizes both the action of going deeper into the water and the act of lowering the nets, suggesting trust in His guidance and a readiness to respond to His command.|
|LUK 5:5|And Simon answered Him, "Master, we toiled all night and caught nothing; but at Your word, I will let down the net."|This translation focuses on capturing the sense of Simon's response and the command he acknowledges. The phrase 'for your word's sake' emphasizes his faith in Jesus' instruction despite previous failures.|
|LUK 5:6|And when they had done this, they enclosed a great multitude of fish; and their net was breaking.|In this verse, the imagery of fishing and the gathering of fish is employed to illustrate the successful result of following Jesus' command. The words 'many fish' and 'their net' emphasize the abundance and the struggle involved in their catch, highlighting the miraculous nature of the event as a direct consequence of obedience to Christ's word.|
|LUK 5:7|And they signaled to their partners in the other boat to come and help them. And they came and filled both boats so that they began to sink.|In this verse, the focus is on the cooperation and urgency in the disciples’ actions, emphasizing the need for assistance and the overwhelming success of their fishing endeavor. The language used here indicates the abundance and the dramatic situation that arises from it, creating a vivid picture of the event.|
|LUK 5:8|When Simon Peter saw this, he fell at Jesus' knees and said, 'Go away from me, Lord, for I am a sinful man.'|In this verse, Simon Peter recognizes his own unworthiness in the presence of Jesus, calling himself a sinful man. This reaction reflects a deep humility and awareness of one’s sinfulness when confronted by the divine. The translation maintains the emotional and spiritual gravity of Peter's confession.|
|LUK 5:9|For astonishment had seized him and all those with him, because of the catch of fish they had taken.|In this verse, the word 'θαμβος' (thambos) conveys a sense of amazement and fear, which is reflected in the translations of similar instances throughout the scriptures. The construction emphasizes the collective experience of Simon Peter and his companions in response to the miraculous catch of fish.|
|LUK 5:10|And likewise, James and John, the sons of Zebedee, who were partners with Simon. And Jesus said to Simon, 'Do not be afraid; from now on you will be catching people.'|In this verse, Jesus reassures Simon Peter with the words 'do not be afraid', a common biblical theme where God calms the fears of His followers. The phrase 'you will catch men' (translated as 'you will be catching people' here) reflects the transformation of Peter's vocation from fishing for fish to bringing people into the Kingdom of God, which aligns with the overarching message of evangelism found throughout the Gospels.|
|LUK 5:11|And when they had brought their boats to land, they left everything and followed him.|This verse emphasizes the complete commitment of Simon Peter and his companions as they leave their former lives to follow Jesus. The term 'leaving all' signifies a profound decision to prioritize their new calling over their previous occupations.|
|LUK 5:12|While he was in one of the cities, there came a man full of leprosy; and when he saw Jesus, he fell on his face and begged him, saying, "Lord, if you are willing, you can make me clean."|In this verse, we see a clear depiction of desperation and faith in the figure of the leper who seeks healing from Jesus. The act of falling on one's face is an expression of humility and reverence, while the phrase 'if you will' highlights the leper's understanding of Jesus's authority and willingness to heal. This moment reflects both a physical ailment and a spiritual plea for cleansing and acceptance.|
|LUK 5:13|And extending His hand, He touched him, saying, 'I am willing; be clean.' And immediately the leprosy left him.|The translation retains the imperative nature of Jesus' command and reflects His authority over illness. The phrase 'I am willing' conveys not just a willingness but a desire, emphasizing Jesus' compassionate nature. The term 'leprosy' is kept consistent with its traditional translation, as it indicates a serious skin disease understood in the cultural context of the time.|
|LUK 5:14|And He commanded him to tell no one, but go and show yourself to the priest, and offer for your cleansing the things which Moses commanded, as a testimony to them.|In this verse, Jesus instructs the healed leper to present himself to the priest as prescribed in the Law of Moses. This serves both as an act of obedience to God's law and as a testimony to the priests regarding His miraculous healing. The command to tell no one emphasizes the nature of Jesus’ ministry and His focus on fulfilling the law rather than seeking public acclaim.|
|LUK 5:15|Yet the news about Him continued to spread all the more, and large crowds gathered to hear Him and to be healed of their infirmities.|In this verse, the emphasis is on the growing reputation of Jesus and the people's response to Him. The term 'crowds' (ὄχλοι) reflects the increasing interest and anticipation surrounding His ministry, while the phrase 'to hear and to be healed' captures the dual purpose of their gathering—spiritual and physical healing.|
|LUK 5:16|But Jesus often withdrew to the wilderness and prayed.|The phrase 'He Himself' emphasizes the personal and intentional nature of Jesus's withdrawal for prayer, highlighting both His humanity and His need for communion with the Father. The term 'wilderness' signifies a place of solitude, away from the distractions of the crowds, suggesting a deeper spiritual purpose behind His retreat. The verb 'was praying' indicates ongoing action, portraying a persistent and devoted prayer life.|
|LUK 5:17|And it came to pass on one of those days, as He was teaching, that there were Pharisees and teachers of the law sitting nearby, who had come from every village of Galilee and Judea and from Jerusalem. And the power of the Lord was present to heal them.|This verse emphasizes Jesus' teaching ministry and the gathering of Pharisees and teachers of the law from various regions. The phrase 'the power of the Lord' indicates divine authority for healing, which is a significant theme throughout the Gospels. The structure reflects both the geographical and spiritual context of Jesus’ ministry.|
|LUK 5:18|And behold, men were bringing on a bed a man who was paralyzed, and they sought to bring him in and lay him before Him.|The verse depicts the determination of the friends of a paralytic man to bring him to Jesus for healing. The word 'kline' used here refers to a bed or couch, emphasizing the man's condition of being carried due to his paralysis. The translation maintains a focus on the action of bringing and presenting the man before Jesus.|
|LUK 5:19|But when they could not find a way to bring him in because of the crowd, they went up on the roof and let him down with his bed through the tiles into the midst before Jesus.|This translation aims to convey the action of lowering the paralyzed man through the roof in a clear and contemporary manner. The word 'doma' is interpreted as 'roof' and 'klinidion' as 'bed,' emphasizing the method used by the friends to bring the paralyzed man to Jesus. The term 'crowd' is included to reflect the obstacle they faced.|
|LUK 5:20|And when Jesus saw their faith, he said to the man, "Friend, your sins are forgiven."|In this translation, I aimed to capture the urgency and compassion of Jesus' words, as he directly addresses the man’s need for forgiveness as well as the faith of those who brought him. The term 'forgiven' is central to the message of redemption in the New Testament, highlighting the transformative power of faith in Christ.|
|LUK 5:21|And the scribes and Pharisees began to reason, saying, "Who is this who speaks blasphemies? Who can forgive sins but God alone?"|In this verse, the scribes and Pharisees are questioning Jesus' authority to forgive sins, revealing their understanding of blasphemy as a serious charge. The words used for 'blasphemies' and 'forgive sins' reflect the deep theological implications of Jesus' actions. The translation strives to capture the tense and accusatory tone of the original Greek text while remaining accessible to modern readers.|
|LUK 5:22|But Jesus, perceiving their thoughts, answered them, saying, "Why do you entertain thoughts in your hearts?|In this verse, Jesus demonstrates His divine ability to perceive the inner thoughts of the scribes and Pharisees. The word 'διαλογισμοὺς' (dialogismous) signifies not just reasoning but also the hidden motives and deliberations within their hearts. The phrase 'ἐν ταῖς καρδίαις ὑμῶν' (in your hearts) emphasizes the spiritual and moral condition that Jesus addresses directly, showing His authority over their thoughts and beliefs.|
|LUK 5:23|Which is easier to say: 'Your sins are forgiven,' or to say, 'Get up and walk'?|In this verse, Jesus highlights the contrast between declaring forgiveness of sins and commanding physical healing. The phrasing emphasizes the authority of Christ over both spiritual and physical realms.|
|LUK 5:24|But so that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins—He said to the paralytic, 'I say to you, arise, and take up your bed and go to your house.'|This verse emphasizes the authority of Jesus, identifying Him as the Son of Man, and demonstrates His power to forgive sins and heal. The command to the paralytic to get up and take his mat underscores the immediate nature of Jesus' healing authority.|
|LUK 5:25|And at once he rose up before them, took up the mat on which he had been lying, and went home praising God.|The translation captures the immediate action of the healed man in response to Jesus' command, emphasizing his obedience and the act of glorifying God. The use of 'immediately' stresses the miraculous nature of the event, while 'glorifying' indicates the proper response to divine healing.|
|LUK 5:26|And all were astonished, and they glorified God, filled with fear, saying, 'We have seen extraordinary things today.'|This verse captures the amazement and reverence of the people witnessing the miraculous work of Jesus. The Greek word 'ἔκστασις' translates to 'astonishment' or 'ecstasy', highlighting their profound emotional response. The phrase 'παράδοξα σήμερον' conveys the extraordinary nature of the events they witnessed, emphasizing that these were unprecedented occurrences.|
|LUK 5:27|After this, He went out and saw a tax collector named Levi sitting at the tax booth, and He said to him, 'Follow Me.'|In this verse, the term 'tax collector' is used, reflecting the social status and occupation of Levi (Matthew), which often carried negative connotations in Jewish society. The imperative 'follow Me' indicates a call to discipleship, a key theme in the Gospels where Jesus invites individuals to leave their old lives behind and become His followers.|
|LUK 5:28|And leaving everything behind, he rose up and followed Him.|In this verse, the key action is 'leaving everything' which emphasizes the radical commitment Levi (Matthew) made to follow Jesus. The word 'arising' signifies both a physical and a spiritual transformation, indicating that he left his old life behind.|
|LUK 5:29|And Levi made a great feast for Him in his house, and there was a large crowd of tax collectors and others reclining at the table with them.|In this verse, the context indicates that Levi (also known as Matthew) is hosting a significant banquet in his home after being called by Jesus. The term 'great banquet' conveys the idea of an important gathering that includes not only his friends but also many tax collectors and others who were looked down upon by society. The verb 'reclining' signifies the posture of eating during that time, which is essential in understanding the cultural practice of dining together.|
|LUK 5:30|And the scribes and Pharisees grumbled against His disciples, saying, "Why do you eat and drink with tax collectors and sinners?"|In this verse, the complaint from the scribes and Pharisees reveals their disdain for Jesus' association with tax collectors and sinners. The term 'goggyzō' (to grumble or murmur) indicates their frustration and disbelief at His actions. The phrase 'with tax collectors and sinners' emphasizes the social stigma attached to those groups, highlighting the contrast between Jesus' ministry and the expectations of the religious elite.|
|LUK 5:31|And Jesus answered them, saying, "It is not the healthy who need a doctor, but those who are unwell."|In this verse, Jesus uses the metaphor of health and sickness to illustrate the spiritual condition of humanity. The emphasis is on the necessity of a healer for those who are spiritually unwell. The wording has been carefully chosen to reflect the urgency and compassion in Christ's calling to those who recognize their need for salvation.|
|LUK 5:32|I have not come to call the righteous, but rather sinners to repentance.|In this verse, Jesus clarifies His mission and the purpose of His ministry. He emphasizes the necessity of repentance for those who recognize their sinful state. The term 'sinners' refers to those who have strayed from God's path and need spiritual healing and restoration through repentance.|
|LUK 5:33|But they said to Him, 'Why do the disciples of John fast often and make prayers, and likewise those of the Pharisees, but Yours eat and drink?'|This verse reflects the question about the practices of fasting and prayer among the followers of John the Baptist and the Pharisees, highlighting a contrast with Jesus' disciples. It is important to maintain the tone of inquiry and the context of ritual observance, contrasting with the joyful approach of Jesus’ ministry.|
|LUK 5:34|But He said to them, "Can you make the friends of the bridegroom fast while the bridegroom is with them?"|In this verse, Jesus uses the metaphor of a bridegroom and wedding guests to explain the nature of His presence with His disciples, suggesting that the time for mourning or fasting is not while He is with them. This verse illustrates the joy and celebration that accompany His ministry, contrasting it with the solemn practice of fasting.|
|LUK 5:35|But the days will come when the bridegroom is taken away from them; then they will fast in those days.|This verse speaks to the concept of fasting in the absence of the bridegroom, symbolizing a time of mourning or longing. The 'bridegroom' is a metaphor for Jesus, and His departure signifies a new phase in the relationship between Him and His followers, thus invoking the need for fasting as an expression of devotion and longing.|
|LUK 5:36|He also told them a parable: No one tears a piece from a new garment and puts it on an old one. If he does, he will tear the new garment, and the piece from the new will not match the old.|This verse uses the imagery of old and new to convey the incompatibility of new teachings with old traditions. The 'new garment' and 'old garment' metaphor illustrates that the new covenant introduced by Christ cannot be successfully merged with the old Jewish law, as it would cause damage to both.|
|LUK 5:37|And no one puts new wine into old wineskins; if he does, the new wine will burst the old skins, and the wine will be spilled, and the skins will be destroyed.|In this verse, the metaphor of new wine and old wineskins illustrates the incompatibility of the new teachings of Jesus with the old traditions. The choice of terms such as 'new' and 'old' emphasizes transformation and the necessity of adapting to new spiritual truths.|
|LUK 5:38|But new wine must be put into new wineskins; otherwise, both will be ruined.|In this verse, Jesus emphasizes the necessity of placing new wine into new wineskins to ensure that both remain intact. This metaphor highlights the transformative nature of His teachings and the importance of renewal in the life of faith.|
|LUK 5:39|And no one who drinks old wine immediately desires new; for he says, 'The old is better.'|The verse uses metaphorical language comparing the old and new to illustrate the contrast between old traditions and the new message of Christ. This fresh translation seeks to maintain the original meaning while ensuring clarity in modern English.|
