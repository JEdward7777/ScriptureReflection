In translating this verse, the challenge is to maintain clarity and fidelity to the original meaning, while also reflecting the confrontation between the religious authorities and Jesus' approach to the law.|
|LUK 6:3|And Jesus answered them, 'Have you not read what David did when he was hungry, he and those who were with him?'|In this verse, Jesus is responding to the Pharisees' challenge about the legality of His disciples' actions on the Sabbath by referencing a well-known incident from David's life that demonstrates a higher principle concerning need and mercy over strict legalism.|

The word 'healing' is central to the discussion of what is permissible on the Sabbath, contrasting mercy with legalism.|
|LUK 6:8|But He knew their thoughts and said to the man with the withered hand, "Rise and stand in the midst." And he rose and stood.|This verse emphasizes Jesus' awareness of the thoughts and intentions of those around Him, contrasting their skepticism with His compassionate command to the man with the withered hand. The use of 'rise' and 'stand' indicates not only a physical healing but also a restoration to a place of dignity and public presence.|
|LUK 6:9|So Jesus said to them, "I will ask you a question: Is it lawful on the Sabbath to do good or to do harm, to save a life or to destroy it?"|In this verse, Jesus poses a rhetorical question to challenge the prevailing interpretations of the Sabbath laws held by the religious leaders of His time.

The essence of this verse underscores the compassionate nature of the law as intended by God.|
|LUK 6:10|And after looking around at them all, He said to the man, "Extend your hand."

|LUK 6:13|And when the day came, He called His disciples to Himself and chose twelve of them, whom He also named apostles.|The verb 'ἐκλεξάμενος' indicates a selective choice, and 'ἀποστόλους' suggests a sent one or messenger.

The additional disciples listed are equally crucial to the establishment of the Gospel's reach.|
|LUK 6:15|Matthew and Thomas, James the son of Alphaeus, and Simon called the Zealot.|In this translation, I've retained the structure and nuances of the original Greek, focusing on the distinct identity of each apostle mentioned, while using clear and contemporary English. The name 'Thaddaeus' has been rendered simply as 'James' where it refers to 'the son of Alphaeus,' maintaining clarity on their identification.|
|LUK 6:16|Judas, the son of James, and Judas Iscariot, who became a traitor.|The phrase 'Ἰούδαν Ἰακώβου' refers to Judas, the son of James, while 'Ἰούδαν Ἰσκαριώτην' identifies Judas Iscariot, noted for his betrayal of Jesus.

The word 'woe' expresses deep sorrow and indicates impending judgment. The phrase 'you rich' is directed towards those who are excessively focused on earthly riches, suggesting that their present comfort will not lead to spiritual satisfaction or divine favor.|
|LUK 6:25|Woe to you who are full now, for you shall be hungry. Woe to you who laugh now, for you shall mourn and weep.|This verse conveys a warning of impending suffering for those who are currently satisfied and joyful, contrasting their present state with a future of hunger and mourning. It reflects the reversal of fortunes that is a common theme in Jesus' teachings.|
|LUK 6:26|Woe to you when all people speak well of you, for so their ancestors treated the false prophets.|This verse contrasts the temporary praise of people with the historical actions of their ancestors who persecuted God's true prophets. It serves as a warning about seeking approval from the crowd rather than from God, emphasizing that true believers may face rejection and scorn in the world.|
|LUK 6:27|But to you who are listening, I say: Love your enemies, and do good to those who hate you.|The Greek term 'ἀγαπᾶτε' (love) conveys a deep, unconditional love that is to be extended even to one’s enemies, a concept that challenges conventional human behavior. The phrase 'καλῶς ποιεῖτε' (do good) indicates an active engagement in benevolent actions towards those who harbor animosity, emphasizing that love is expressed through deeds.|
|LUK 6:28|Bless those who speak ill of you; pray for those who mistreat you.|This verse encourages believers to respond to hostility with prayer and blessings, which is a profound teaching found throughout Scripture.

This reflects the heart of Christian teaching on love and forgiveness.|
|LUK 6:29|To the one who strikes you on the cheek, offer the other also; and from the one who takes away your cloak, do not withhold your tunic.|This verse emphasizes the radical nature of love and forgiveness in the face of hostility.

|LUK 6:32|And if you love those who love you, what credit is that to you?

This reflects the broader teaching on the nature of love and grace, highlighting that true kindness extends beyond mere reciprocation.|
|LUK 6:34|And if you lend to those from whom you hope to receive back, what credit is that to you? For even sinners lend to sinners, expecting to be repaid in full.|In this verse, the emphasis is on the futility of expecting rewards for actions that are merely reciprocated among sinners.

|LUK 6:36|Be merciful, just as your Father is merciful.|In this verse, Jesus emphasizes the importance of being merciful, drawing a direct parallel to the nature of God as merciful.

|LUK 6:37|Do not judge, and you will not be judged; do not condemn, and you will not be condemned; forgive, and you will be forgiven.|In this verse, the concepts of judgment and condemnation are central. The use of 'judge' and 'condemn' emphasizes the reciprocal nature of these actions, suggesting that one should refrain from judgment if they do not wish to be judged in turn. The imperative to 'forgive' indicates a call to mercy, which aligns with the previous verse's exhortation to be merciful like the Father.|
|LUK 6:38|Give, and it will be given to you; a good measure, pressed down, shaken together, and overflowing, will be poured into your lap. For with the measure you use, it will be measured back to you.|This verse emphasizes the principle of reciprocity in giving and receiving, highlighting that the measure one uses in generosity will determine how much they themselves receive. The imagery of a measuring cup overflowing suggests abundance and God's provision.|
|LUK 6:39|He also told them a parable: "Can a blind man guide a blind man? Will they not both fall into a pit?"|In this verse, Jesus uses a rhetorical question to illustrate the absurdity of a blind person attempting to guide another blind person, indicating the inevitable consequence of such an action. The imagery of falling into a pit serves to highlight the danger of following leaders who lack spiritual insight.|
|LUK 6:40|A disciple is not above his teacher; but everyone who is fully trained will be like his teacher.|This verse emphasizes the relationship between a disciple and a teacher, highlighting that while a disciple learns and grows, they will ultimately reflect the character and knowledge of their teacher.

|LUK 6:41|Why do you see the speck that is in your brother's eye, but do not perceive the beam that is in your own eye?|This verse uses the metaphor of seeing clearly, contrasting the small fault in someone else with a much larger fault in oneself. It emphasizes self-examination before passing judgment on others.|
|LUK 6:42|Or how can you say to your brother, ‘Brother, let me remove the speck that is in your eye,’ when you do not see the beam that is in your own eye? Hypocrite! First, remove the beam from your own eye, and then you will see clearly to remove the speck that is in your brother’s eye.|This verse emphasizes the importance of self-examination before judging others. It calls out hypocrisy and highlights the need to address our own faults first. The use of the terms 'beam' and 'speck' creates a stark contrast that illustrates the gravity of our own shortcomings in comparison to those of others.|
|LUK 6:43|For a good tree does not produce rotten fruit, nor does a rotten tree produce good fruit.|This verse emphasizes the principle that a tree is known by its fruit, which correlates to the moral and ethical behavior of individuals. In biblical terms, 'good' and 'bad' fruit symbolize the outcomes of one's character and actions, reflecting their inner nature.|
|LUK 6:44|For each tree is recognized by its own fruit. People do not gather figs from thornbushes, nor do they pick grapes from brambles.|This verse emphasizes the principle that the quality of a tree's fruit reveals its true nature. The metaphor is used to illustrate the correlation between actions and character. The use of specific plants (thorns and brambles) underscores that one does not expect good from what is inherently incapable of producing it.|
|LUK 6:45|A good person brings good things out of the good stored up in their heart, and an evil person brings evil things out of the evil stored up in their heart. For the mouth speaks what the heart is full of.|This verse emphasizes the connection between a person's inner character and the words they speak, drawing a distinction between the good and evil that originates from the heart. The original Greek uses the terms 'good' and 'evil' in a clear manner, and this translation aims to reflect that clarity while maintaining the flow of English.|
|LUK 6:46|Why do you call me ‘Lord, Lord,’ and do not do what I say?|In this verse, Jesus is emphasizing the importance of not just acknowledging Him as Lord with our words, but also demonstrating that acknowledgment through our actions. The repetition of 'Lord' in the original Greek conveys a sense of urgent questioning, prompting self-reflection about true discipleship and obedience.|
|LUK 6:47|Everyone who comes to me and hears my words and acts on them, I will show you what he is like:|This verse emphasizes the importance of not just hearing the words of Jesus but actively putting them into practice. The term 'coming to me' suggests a willingness to engage, while 'hearing' and 'doing' imply a holistic response to His teaching. The metaphor of building implies the strength and stability derived from such actions.|
|LUK 6:48|He is like a man building a house, who dug down deep and laid the foundation on rock. When a flood came, the torrent struck that house but could not shake it, because it was well built on the rock.|This verse emphasizes the importance of building one's life on a solid foundation, specifically the foundation of Christ's teachings. The imagery of digging deep and laying a foundation on rock is a metaphor for steadfast faith and obedience to God's Word.|
|LUK 6:49|But the one who hears and does not act is like a man who built a house on the ground without a foundation; when the river struck, it collapsed at once, and the ruin of that house was great.|This verse emphasizes the importance of not just hearing the teachings but also putting them into practice, illustrating the consequences of failing to do so through the metaphor of a house built without a solid foundation.|
