|:---------:|-------|-------------------|
|LUK 20:1|Now it happened that on one of those days, while He was teaching the people in the temple and proclaiming the good news, the chief priests and the scribes, along with the elders, approached Him.|This verse captures a significant moment where Jesus is actively teaching and spreading the Gospel message in the temple, amidst growing opposition from religious leaders. The use of the word 'teaching' underscores His role as a Rabbi and a messenger of God's truth, while 'the people' indicates the broad audience that was attentive to His words. The term 'priests' and 'scribes' refers to the religious authorities who were increasingly threatened by His influence.|
|LUK 20:2|They spoke to Him, saying, "Tell us, by what authority are You doing these things? Or who is it that gave You this authority?"|The phrase 'in what authority' is a direct question aimed at understanding the source of Jesus' actions. The use of 'give' in relation to authority implies a recognition of a power structure, where authority is not inherent but granted. This reflects the tension between Jesus and the established religious leaders of the time.|
|LUK 20:3|But He answered and said to them, "I will ask you one question as well; answer Me this, and I will tell you by what authority I do these things."|In this verse, Jesus responds to the religious leaders' challenge by turning the question back on them. This is a common teaching method used in rabbinic tradition. The phrase 'I will ask you one question' emphasizes the importance of the inquiry and invites the listeners to engage thoughtfully with His authority.|
|LUK 20:4|Was the baptism of John from heaven, or was it from men?|In this translation, the emphasis is placed on the source of John's baptism, contrasting divine authority ('from heaven') with human origin ('from men'). The phrase structure mimics the interrogative nature of the original text, focusing on the authority behind the practice of baptism, which is central to the conversation.|
|LUK 20:5|But they reasoned among themselves, saying, 'If we say, ‘From heaven,’ he will say, ‘Why then did you not believe him?’|In this verse, the phrase 'if we say' highlights the deliberative nature of the religious leaders as they attempt to navigate their dilemma. The word 'heaven' suggests divine authority, contrasting their fears about earthly repercussions. This internal debate showcases their skepticism and political maneuvering, typical of the interactions between Jesus and the religious authorities.|
|LUK 20:6|But if we say, ‘From men,’ the people will stone us, for they are convinced that John was a prophet.|This verse emphasizes the public's belief in John's prophetic role, indicating that the opinions of the people would sway the leaders' response. It reflects the tension between public perception and personal conviction among the religious authorities.|
|LUK 20:7|So they answered that they did not know where it was from.|This verse highlights the fear of the religious leaders to give a truthful answer regarding John the Baptist, reflecting their awareness of public opinion and the implications of their response. The phrase 'not to know' indicates their refusal to confront the truth due to fear of consequences.|
|LUK 20:8|And Jesus said to them, "Nor will I tell you by what authority I do these things."|In this verse, Jesus emphasizes that He is not compelled to reveal the authority behind His actions, as He is operating under divine authority. The phrasing is intentionally provocative, reflecting the ongoing challenge between Jesus and the religious leaders.|
|LUK 20:9|He began to tell the people this parable: "A certain man planted a vineyard, and leased it to farmers, and went away for a long time."|This verse introduces a parable about a man who plants a vineyard, paralleling the imagery of God’s care for His people, often represented in scripture through vineyard symbolism. The term 'vinedresser' or 'farmer' relates to the concept of stewardship over what is entrusted to one, a recurring theme in Jesus' teachings.|
|LUK 20:10|At the appropriate time, he sent a servant to the farmers to receive some of the vineyard's fruit; but the farmers beat him and sent him away empty-handed.|This verse describes the action of the vineyard owner sending a servant to collect the expected produce from the tenants. The term 'fruit' is used metaphorically for the expected results of one's labor, reflecting the responsibility and accountability of those entrusted with the vineyard. The rejection and violence against the servant signify the rejection of authority and accountability.|
|LUK 20:11|And he added to send another servant; but they beat him also and treated him with contempt, and sent him away empty-handed.|In this verse, the act of sending another servant signifies the persistence of the master in trying to claim what is rightfully his, despite the rejection and violence exhibited by the farmers. The choice of the words 'beaten' and 'dishonored' reflects the seriousness of the farmers' disrespect towards the master's authority and intention.|
|LUK 20:12|And he sent a third servant. But they also wounded him and cast him out.|This verse is a continuation of the parable of the wicked tenants, emphasizing the rejection and mistreatment of God's messengers. The original text implies a sequence of rejection that escalates with each subsequent servant sent by the landowner. The term 'third' signifies the continued persistence of the landowner, while 'beaten' suggests physical harm and contempt. The phrase 'sent away empty-handed' is crucial in showing the disregard for the servant's purpose.|
|LUK 20:13|Then the owner of the vineyard said, 'What shall I do? I will send my beloved Son; perhaps when they see him, they will feel ashamed.'|In this verse, the phrase 'my beloved Son' reflects both the deep love of the owner and the significance of sending a son, paralleling the themes found in other biblical references to God's love for His Son. The term 'they might feel shame' indicates the hope that seeing the Son would lead to repentance among the workers, aligning with biblical themes of redemption and repentance.|
|LUK 20:14|But when the tenants saw him, they reasoned among themselves, saying, 'This is the heir. Come, let us kill him, so that the inheritance may be ours.'|In this verse, the concept of the heir is pivotal, highlighting the wicked intentions of the tenants who refuse to recognize the authority and value of the heir sent by the owner. The use of the phrase 'let us kill him' illustrates the extreme measures taken by those who reject rightful authority. This verse ties back into the broader theme of rebellion against God's appointed leaders, particularly in the context of the parables of the vineyard.|
|LUK 20:15|And having thrown him out of the vineyard, they killed him. What then will the owner of the vineyard do to them?|This verse captures the dramatic moment of rejection and execution within the parable of the wicked tenants, which serves as an allegory for Israel's treatment of the prophets and ultimately of Christ Himself. The emphasis on being cast out and killed is central to the message of the parable, demonstrating the consequences of their actions.|
|LUK 20:16|He will come and destroy those farmers, and will give the vineyard to others." Upon hearing this, they exclaimed, "God forbid!"|This verse emphasizes the consequence for the unfaithful stewards of the vineyard, highlighting themes of judgment and the transfer of stewardship to others. The phrase 'He will come and destroy' conveys the severity of the owner's response to their actions, and 'give the vineyard to others' underscores the idea of divine judgment leading to new opportunities for faithful stewardship.|
|LUK 20:17|But he looked directly at them and said, 'What then does this Scripture mean: “The stone that the builders rejected has become the cornerstone”?'|In this verse, Jesus references a common theme found in Scripture regarding rejection and the unexpected elevation of something deemed worthless to a position of prominence. The imagery of the stone represents both Christ Himself and the idea of judgment against the leaders who reject Him.|
|LUK 20:18|Everyone who falls on that stone will be shattered; but upon whomsoever it falls, it will grind him to powder.|This verse uses imagery of a stone that causes destruction to those who encounter it incorrectly, indicating a warning about the consequences of rejecting Christ.|
|LUK 20:19|The chief priests and the scribes sought to lay hands on Him at that very hour, but they feared the people, for they knew that He had spoken this parable against them.|In this translation, I've emphasized the intent of the religious leaders and their fear of the people's reaction. The phrase 'they sought to lay hands on Him' conveys their intention to arrest or harm Jesus, while the reason for their hesitance is attributed to their awareness of the people's sentiments regarding His teachings.|
|LUK 20:20|So they watched Him closely and sent out spies, pretending to be righteous, in order to catch Him in something He might say, so they could deliver Him to the authority and power of the governor.|In this translation, the term 'spies' is used to reflect the deceptive nature of those sent to catch Jesus. 'Pretending to be righteous' conveys their insincerity. The phrase 'to seize his words' reflects the intent to trap Him in a statement that could lead to legal consequences, aligning with the overarching theme of hostility against Jesus.|
|LUK 20:21|So they questioned Him, saying, 'Teacher, we know that you speak and teach rightly, and you do not show favoritism, but truly teach the way of God.'|This verse highlights the acknowledgment of Jesus' integrity and truthful teaching. The phrase 'you teach the way of God in truth' emphasizes the importance of authenticity in conveying God's message. It contrasts with the deceptive motives of those questioning Him.|
|LUK 20:22|Is it lawful for us to give tribute to Caesar, or not?|The original Greek phrase 'ἔξεστιν ἡμῖν Καίσαρι φόρον δοῦναι ἢ οὔ;' translates to 'Is it lawful for us to give tribute to Caesar, or not?' In this context, the question revolves around the legality and morality of paying taxes to a Roman authority, reflecting the tension between allegiance to God and earthly governance. The translation emphasizes the moral inquiry posed by the questioners.|
|LUK 20:23|But perceiving their cunning, He said to them, 'Why do you test me?'|This translation captures the essence of Jesus's discernment regarding the intentions of those questioning Him. The phrase 'Why do you test me?' is a direct address to their deceptive inquiry, reflecting His awareness of their motives.|
|LUK 20:24|Show me a denarius. Whose likeness and inscription does it bear? They replied, 'Caesar's.'|In this verse, Jesus requests to see a denarius, a common coin in that time, and uses it to illustrate a point about authority and obligation. The wording emphasizes the importance of understanding ownership and the implications of taxes in relation to earthly authority versus divine authority.|
|LUK 20:25|He said to them, 'Then give to Caesar what belongs to Caesar, and to God what belongs to God.'|In this verse, Jesus emphasizes the distinction between earthly authority and divine authority, instructing His audience to fulfill their obligations to both. The phrase 'Render therefore to Caesar' suggests a responsible engagement with civic duties, while 'to God the things that are God’s' reminds believers of their spiritual obligations.|
|LUK 20:26|And they could not seize upon His words in opposition to the people; and marveling at His reply, they fell silent.|The translation seeks to convey the astonishment of the audience in response to Jesus' wisdom and authority. The phrase 'they could not take hold of his word' implies a failure to challenge Him, demonstrating the strength of His response.|
|LUK 20:27|Then some of the Sadducees, who deny that there is a resurrection, came to Him and questioned Him.|This verse introduces the Sadducees, a group known for denying the resurrection, which sets the stage for the theological debate that follows. The wording has been chosen to maintain clarity while conveying the original intent and context of the scripture.|
|LUK 20:28|They asked Him, "Teacher, Moses wrote for us that if a man's brother dies, leaving a wife but no children, the man must take the wife and raise up children for his brother."|This verse illustrates the Jewish levirate marriage law where a brother is obligated to marry his deceased brother's widow to preserve the family lineage. The phrase 'raise up seed' indicates the importance of offspring in ancient Hebrew culture, reflecting both social and religious significance.|
|LUK 20:29|Now there were seven brothers; and the first took a wife, and died without children.|In this verse, the number seven (ἑπτὰ) emphasizes the extraordinary nature of the situation. The term 'brother' (ἀδελφοὶ) is significant in the context of the Levirate marriage tradition. The phrase 'having no children' (ἄτεκνος) underscores the importance of lineage and inheritance in Jewish culture, which is central to the argument being made in this passage.|
|LUK 20:30|And the second brother took her as his wife, and he also died without leaving any children.|In this translation, I have maintained the context of a marital obligation in the face of death and childlessness, reflecting the ancient practices described in the Law. The Greek phrase "ἀπέθανεν ἄτεκνος" (died childless) has been rendered to maintain clarity and connection to the previous verse's discussion of inheritance and lineage.|
|LUK 20:31|And the third also took her, and in the same manner, all seven died, leaving no children.|The phrase 'οὐ κατέλιπον τέκνα' translates directly to 'they left no children,' emphasizing the absence of descendants after the deaths of the brothers. This conveys the broader context of the Sadducees' challenge regarding resurrection and the continuity of life through lineage.|
|LUK 20:32|Finally, the woman also died.|This verse captures the inevitable fate that befalls all humans, emphasizing mortality in a narrative where the Sadducees attempt to challenge the doctrine of resurrection. The word 'ἀπέθανεν' clearly indicates the finality of death, aligning with biblical themes of human mortality.|
|LUK 20:33|In the resurrection, therefore, whose wife does she become? For the seven had her as a wife.|This verse reflects the Sadducees' question regarding marriage after resurrection, challenging Jesus' teachings on the afterlife. The wording captures the essence of their inquiry and the cultural context of marriage in the resurrection.|
|LUK 20:34|And Jesus answered them, "The sons of this age marry and are given in marriage;"|This verse highlights Jesus' teaching on the nature of relationships in the resurrection, emphasizing that earthly marital customs do not apply in the afterlife.|
|LUK 20:35|But those who are deemed worthy to attain that age and the resurrection from the dead neither marry nor are given in marriage.|In this verse, Jesus emphasizes the transformative nature of the resurrection. Those who are worthy of that age, meaning the age to come, will experience a different existence that transcends earthly relationships like marriage. The terms used indicate a departure from worldly practices and an entrance into a spiritual realm.|
|LUK 20:36|For they can no longer die, because they are like angels and are children of God, being children of the resurrection.|This translation emphasizes the state of existence after resurrection, indicating a fundamental change in nature and relationships. The phrase 'they can no longer die' underscores the permanence of this new life, while the connection to angels illustrates a divine nature bestowed upon the resurrected. The phrase 'children of God' serves to reaffirm their identity in relation to the divine.|

The names mentioned signify a continuity of existence and a relationship with God that persists beyond physical death.|
|LUK 20:38|For God is not the God of the dead, but of the living; for all are alive to Him.|This verse highlights the nature of God as a living God who is associated with the living, emphasizing the reality of life after death, and reflects the continuity of life for those who are in relationship with Him.|

The term 'teacher' reflects the respect the scribes had for Jesus as a rabbi or authority on the Scriptures.|
|LUK 20:40|And they no longer dared to ask Him anything.|This verse captures the final moment of questioning by the religious leaders, highlighting their inability to counter Jesus' wisdom. The word 'dare' reflects their fear and recognition of His authority.|
|LUK 20:41|But He said to them, 'How is it that they say the Christ is the Son of David?'|This verse is part of a larger discourse where Jesus challenges the prevailing understanding of the Messiah's lineage. The use of 'Christ' and 'son of David' indicates the Jewish expectation of a royal messianic figure descended from David, which Jesus is questioning in a deeper theological sense.|
|LUK 20:42|And David himself says in the book of Psalms, 'The Lord said to my Lord, “Sit at my right hand.”'|In this verse, the phrase 'the Lord said to my Lord' emphasizes the distinction between God the Father and the Messiah, illustrating the divine authority and position of the Messiah at the right hand of God.

|LUK 20:46|Beware of the scribes who desire to walk in long robes, and love greetings in the marketplaces, the best seats in the synagogues, and the places of honor at banquets.|This verse warns against the pride and self-importance of the scribes, who sought honor and respect from the people through their outward appearances and social standing. The terms used here convey a sense of vanity and the desire for public recognition, which stands in stark contrast to the humility that Jesus teaches.|
|LUK 20:47|They devour the houses of widows and for the sake of appearance make long prayers; these will receive a greater judgment.|In this verse, Jesus condemns the religious leaders for their exploitation of vulnerable widows, using pretense in their prayers to mask their greed.
