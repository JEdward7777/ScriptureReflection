|LUK 16:1|He also said to his disciples, "There was a certain rich man who had a steward, and this steward was accused to him of wasting his goods."|This verse introduces the parable of the dishonest steward, emphasizing the themes of stewardship and accountability. The Greek word for 'steward' (οἰκονόμος) implies one who manages a household or estate, and the phrase 'was accused' suggests a serious breach of trust.|
|LUK 16:2|So he called him and said to him, ‘What is this I hear about you? Give an account of your stewardship, for you can no longer be steward.’|In this translation, the term 'steward' reflects the original Greek word for a manager or overseer, indicating responsibility over the master’s resources. The phrase 'give an account' is a common biblical expression denoting the necessity of providing a report or justification for one's actions, particularly in the context of stewardship and management of resources.|
|LUK 16:3|Then the steward said within himself, 'What shall I do? For my master is taking away the stewardship from me. I cannot dig; I am ashamed to beg.'|This verse captures the internal struggle of the steward faced with losing his position. The terms 'steward' and 'master' are central to the parable, emphasizing themes of accountability and the management of resources. The translation aims to reflect the urgency and desperation of the steward's situation.|
|LUK 16:4|I know what I will do, so that when I am removed from my stewardship, they may welcome me into their own homes.|In this verse, the steward contemplates a strategy to secure his future after losing his position. The phrase 'δέξωνταί με εἰς τοὺς οἴκους ἑαυτῶν' translates to 'they may receive me into their own homes', suggesting his intent to build relationships for future support. The term 'οἰκονομίας' refers to stewardship, highlighting the themes of responsibility and accountability.|
|LUK 16:5|And calling to himself each of his master's debtors, he said to the first, 'How much do you owe my master?'|This verse reflects the responsibility of stewardship and the interactions between a master and his debtors. The terms used indicate a formal questioning about debts, which signifies the authority of the master over the servants.|
|LUK 16:6|He said, 'A hundred measures of oil.' And he said to him, 'Take your bill, and sit down quickly and write fifty.'|In this verse, the servant's act of reducing the debt reflects the urgency and cleverness that is key to the parable. The terms 'hundred' and 'fifty' emphasize the significant reduction of the debt, while 'letter' signifies a formal record, indicating the seriousness of the financial transaction.|
|LUK 16:7|Then he said to another, 'And what do you owe?' And he replied, 'A hundred measures of wheat.' He said to him, 'Take your bill, and write eighty.'|In this verse, the dialogue emphasizes the act of adjusting a financial obligation. The phrase 'take your bill' indicates a direct instruction to handle the debt, while the change from 'one hundred measures of wheat' to 'eighty' highlights the practice of debt reduction or forgiveness.|
|LUK 16:8|And the master commended the unrighteous steward for his shrewdness; for the children of this world are more astute in dealing with their own generation than the children of light.|In this verse, the term 'unrighteous steward' refers to the manager of resources, particularly in a context of shrewdness and wisdom. The contrast between the 'children of this age' and 'the children of light' highlights the different kinds of wisdom at play. This verse emphasizes a call to discernment and practical wisdom, especially in the stewardship of earthly resources and relationships.|
|LUK 16:9|And I tell you, make friends for yourselves by means of unrighteous wealth, so that when it fails, they may receive you into eternal dwellings.|This verse emphasizes the need to use worldly resources wisely to foster relationships that bear eternal significance. The term 'mammon of unrighteousness' refers to the wealth that is often gained through unethical means. In using such wealth to help others, believers can establish friendships that lead to heavenly rewards.|
|LUK 16:10|The one who is faithful in a very little is also faithful in much, and the one who is unjust in a very little is also unjust in much.|This verse emphasizes the importance of faithfulness in both small and large matters, highlighting a consistent character that remains true regardless of the scale of responsibility.|
|LUK 16:11|So if you have not been faithful in unrighteous wealth, who will entrust to you the true riches?|This verse addresses the importance of faithfulness and trustworthiness, especially in regards to material wealth. The term 'unjust' can be understood as unfaithful or unreliable. The contrast between the 'unrighteous mammon' (material wealth) and 'true riches' highlights the spiritual versus the earthly.|
|LUK 16:12|And if you have not been faithful in that which belongs to another, who will give you what is your own?|This verse emphasizes the principle of stewardship and faithfulness in small matters, suggesting that one's ability to handle true wealth depends on their faithfulness in less significant responsibilities.|
|LUK 16:13|No servant can serve two masters; for either he will hate the one and love the other, or he will hold to one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and wealth.|This verse emphasizes the impossibility of serving two different masters simultaneously, highlighting the ultimate loyalty to God versus worldly riches, often symbolized as Mammon.|
|LUK 16:14|The Pharisees, who were lovers of money, heard all these things and ridiculed Him.|This verse highlights the disdain of the Pharisees towards Jesus' teaching about the impossibility of serving both God and wealth.

|LUK 16:15|And He said to them, 'You justify yourselves before others, but God knows your hearts; for what is revered among men is detestable in the sight of God.'|In this verse, the contrast between the perception of men and the knowledge of God is emphasized. The Pharisees are depicted as self-justifying before others, but God perceives their true intentions. The phrase 'what is highly esteemed among men' indicates societal values that may conflict with God's standards.|
|LUK 16:16|The Law and the Prophets were until John; since then, the Kingdom of God is being proclaimed, and everyone is forcefully pressing into it.|This verse contrasts the period of the Law and the Prophets with the new era inaugurated by John the Baptist and the proclamation of the Kingdom of God. The language indicates a transition from the old covenant to the new, emphasizing the urgency and determination of those entering the Kingdom.|
|LUK 16:17|But it is easier for heaven and earth to pass away than for one stroke of a letter of the Law to fall.|This verse emphasizes the permanence and authority of the Law. The term 'keria' refers to the smallest letter in the Hebrew alphabet (yodh), symbolizing the significance of every part of the Law. The use of 'easier' contrasts the challenges of transgressing the Law with the grand scope of divine realities.|
|LUK 16:18|Everyone who divorces his wife and marries another commits adultery, and he who marries a woman who is divorced from her husband commits adultery.|This verse emphasizes the gravity of divorce and remarriage within the context of adultery, highlighting the sanctity of the marital bond as intended by God.|

|LUK 16:21|And longing to be filled with the crumbs that fell from the rich man's table; moreover, even the dogs came and licked his sores.|This translation emphasizes the longing of the beggar, Lazarus, for even the smallest sustenance, symbolizing his dire state and the contrast with the wealthy man. The mention of the dogs licking his sores highlights his total degradation and the lack of compassion from those around him.|
|LUK 16:22|And it came to pass that the poor man died and was carried away by the angels to Abraham's side; the rich man also died and was buried.|This verse highlights the transition of the poor man from earthly suffering to a place of comfort in the presence of Abraham, representing a heavenly reward. The mention of angels signifies honor and divine care in his passing. The contrast with the rich man's fate underscores themes of justice and the reversal of fortunes in the afterlife.|
|LUK 16:23|And in Hades, lifting up his eyes while in torment, he saw Abraham from afar, and Lazarus in his bosom.|In this verse, the imagery of torment and recognition is significant. The term 'Hades' refers to the realm of the dead, and the rich man's anguish highlights the contrast between his fate and that of Lazarus. The use of 'Abraham' signifies a connection to faith and the righteous.|
|LUK 16:24|And he cried out, 'Father Abraham, have mercy on me, and send Lazarus so that he may dip the tip of his finger in water and cool my tongue, for I am in agony in this flame.'|This verse captures the desperate plea of the rich man in Hades, emphasizing his recognition of Abraham and his appeal for relief from torment. The choice of words aims to convey the depth of his suffering and his desire for a simple act of mercy, while staying faithful to the original Greek text.|
|LUK 16:25|But Abraham said, 'Child, remember that you received your good things in your lifetime, and Lazarus in like manner bad things; but now he is comforted here, and you are in anguish.'|This verse encapsulates the concept of divine justice and the reversal of fortunes after death, highlighting the dichotomy between the rich man and Lazarus. The term 'child' (τέκνον) indicates a close relationship but also a rebuke. The contrast between 'good' (ἀγαθά) and 'evil' (κακά) further emphasizes the moral consequences of one's life choices. The word 'tormented' (ὀδυνᾶσαι) vividly illustrates the suffering experienced by the rich man, enhancing the severity of his current state in contrast to his previous life of luxury.|
|LUK 16:26|And besides all this, a great chasm has been fixed between us and you, so that those who wish to pass from here to you cannot, nor can anyone cross over from there to us.|The phrase 'a great chasm has been established' emphasizes the unbridgeable divide between the two states of existence. The terms 'desire to cross over' signify the desperation of the tormented seeking relief, while 'cannot' underscores the permanence of their fate.|
|LUK 16:27|And he said, 'Then I ask you, father, to send him to my father's house.'|In this verse, the request is made by someone in torment, highlighting a desperate plea for mercy. The term 'father' reflects a familial relationship, invoking a sense of urgency and need. The phrase 'send him' indicates a desire for intervention and assistance from beyond the current state of existence.|
|LUK 16:28|For I have five brothers; let him warn them, so that they will not also come to this place of torment.|This verse expresses a sense of urgency and concern for family salvation. The term 'five brothers' suggests a personal plea, while 'place of torment' alludes to the consequences of choices made in life.|
|LUK 16:29|But Abraham said to him, 'They have Moses and the prophets; let them hear them.'|In this verse, Abraham responds to the request for a warning by emphasizing the importance of the existing revelations given through Moses and the prophets. The implication is that these writings are sufficient for understanding God’s will and avoiding destruction.|
|LUK 16:30|But he said, 'No, father Abraham, but if someone goes to them from the dead, they will repent.'|In this verse, the term for 'repentance' (μετάνοια) conveys a change of heart and mind that leads to a transformation in behavior. The emphasis is on the belief that witnessing the miraculous, such as someone returning from the dead, could instigate this change in those who are lost. This concept aligns with the overall biblical message about the importance of repentance in relation to faith and salvation.|
|LUK 16:31|But he said to him, 'If they do not listen to Moses and the Prophets, neither will they be convinced if someone rises from the dead.'|This verse emphasizes the critical role of listening to God’s Word as delivered through Moses and the prophets. It implies that miraculous signs, such as someone rising from the dead, would not guarantee belief if the foundational teachings are disregarded.|
