| Reference | Verse | Translation Notes |
|:---------:|-------|-------------------|
|GAL 6:1|Brothers, if anyone is caught in any transgression, you who are spiritual should restore him in a spirit of gentleness. Keep watch on yourself, lest you too be tempted.|The translation reflects the imperative to restore those who have stumbled, emphasizing the importance of humility and self-awareness. The word 'spirit' is interpreted in a way that reflects the fruit of the Spirit (Galatians 5:22-23), promoting gentleness and compassion in correction.|
|GAL 6:2|Bear one another’s burdens, and so fulfill the law of Christ.|In this verse, Paul emphasizes the communal responsibility among believers to support one another in burdens. The concept of 'bearing burdens' reflects the call to love and mutual support within the body of Christ, aligning with the broader themes found in his letters concerning Christian unity and care for one another. The term 'law of Christ' refers to the commandment to love one another as exemplified by Christ.|
|GAL 6:3|For if anyone thinks he is something when he is nothing, he deceives himself.|In this verse, the Apostle Paul addresses the danger of pride and self-deception among believers. The phrase 'if anyone thinks he is something' indicates a warning against inflated self-perception. The term 'deceived' is emphasized to show that self-importance can lead to a distorted view of reality and a disconnect from the truth of one's identity in Christ.|
|GAL 6:4|But let each one examine his own work, and then he will have rejoicing in himself alone, and not in another.|This verse emphasizes personal accountability and self-reflection, urging individuals to assess their own actions rather than compare themselves with others. The focus is on humility and personal integrity.|
|GAL 6:5|For each one will bear his own load.|In this verse, the Apostle Paul emphasizes personal responsibility in bearing one's own burdens. The word 'φορτίον' (burden) suggests a load or responsibility that each individual must carry. This can relate to moral, spiritual, or practical challenges in life. The structure is straightforward, focusing on the individual as responsible for their own actions and consequences, echoing the theme of accountability found throughout Scripture.|
|GAL 6:6|Let the one who is taught the word share all good things with the one who teaches.|The term 'κατηχούμενος' refers to a learner or a person receiving instruction, while 'κατηχοῦντι' pertains to the one providing that instruction. The verse emphasizes mutual support and sharing of resources between teachers and students, particularly in the context of spiritual teachings.|
|GAL 6:7|Do not be deceived; God is not mocked, for whatever a person sows, that will he also reap.|This verse serves as a reminder of the principle of sowing and reaping, emphasizing that one's actions directly influence the outcomes in their lives. The language is straightforward, reflecting a clear moral teaching that warns against deception regarding God's justice.|
|GAL 6:8|For the one who sows to his own flesh will from the flesh reap corruption, but the one who sows to the Spirit will from the Spirit reap eternal life.|This verse contrasts the outcomes of two types of sowing: one that is fleshly and leads to decay, and another that is spiritual, resulting in eternal life. The terms 'sow' and 'reap' are agricultural metaphors emphasizing cause and effect in spiritual and moral choices.|
|GAL 6:9|And let us not grow weary in doing good, for in due season we will reap if we do not lose heart.|This translation aims to capture the encouragement to persist in doing good without losing heart, emphasizing the eventual reward for those who maintain their efforts.|
|GAL 6:10|So then, as we have the opportunity, let us do good to everyone, especially to those who are of the household of faith.|In this verse, the apostle Paul encourages believers to engage actively in good deeds towards everyone, with particular emphasis on those who are part of the faith community. The phrase 'as we have opportunity' indicates a proactive approach to doing good, while 'especially to those of the household of faith' underscores the importance of caring for fellow believers.|
|GAL 6:11|See with what large letters I have written to you with my own hand.|In this verse, Paul emphasizes the personal touch of his writing, indicating the authenticity and importance of the message. The phrase 'with my own hand' signifies a personal commitment and authority behind the words. The term 'large letters' could reflect either the physical size of his handwriting or the weight of what he is about to convey, emphasizing the significance of the message he is delivering.|
|GAL 6:12|As many as desire to make a good showing in the flesh, they compel you to be circumcised, only that they may not suffer persecution for the cross of Christ.|In this verse, Paul addresses the motivations behind certain individuals insisting on physical circumcision among the believers. The emphasis is on the conflict between seeking human approval versus the suffering associated with true discipleship in Christ. The choice of the words here conveys the pressure placed on the believers to conform outwardly, while the deeper spiritual reality is their faith in Christ and the crucifixion of the flesh.|
|GAL 6:13|For neither do those who are circumcised keep the law themselves, but they desire to have you circumcised, that they may boast in your flesh.|This verse highlights the hypocrisy of those who demand circumcision while failing to uphold the law themselves. It reflects the motive of some to boast in the flesh rather than to pursue true faith in Christ.|
|GAL 6:14|But far be it from me to boast except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom the world has been crucified to me, and I to the world.|This verse emphasizes the concept of boasting not in human accomplishments or the flesh but solely in the sacrifice of Jesus Christ on the cross. The mention of the 'world' being crucified signifies a separation from worldly values and desires, aligning the believer’s identity with Christ’s redemptive work.|
|GAL 6:15|For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision nor uncircumcision has any value, but only a new creation.|In this verse, Paul emphasizes that in Christ, external markers such as circumcision or uncircumcision have no spiritual value. The focus is on a transformed identity as a 'new creation,' which signifies a profound change in one’s spiritual state.|
|GAL 6:16|And as many as walk by this rule, peace and mercy be upon them, and upon the Israel of God.|The phrase 'this rule' in the context of Galatians refers to the guiding principles of faith and the way of living in accordance with the Spirit, which stands in contrast to reliance on the law. The terms 'peace' and 'mercy' signify blessings that are granted to those who follow this path, emphasizing the importance of community and the covenant people of God.|
|GAL 6:17|From now on, let no one cause me trouble, for I bear the scars of the Lord Jesus on my body.|In this verse, Paul emphasizes the personal suffering and marks he bears as a follower of Christ. The term 'stigmata' refers to the wounds or marks of Jesus, which in this context symbolizes the identity and sacrifices of a true believer. The use of 'from now on' indicates a definitive change in his life post-conversion, as well as a request for others to respect his unique calling and the struggles he faces for the Gospel.|
|GAL 6:18|The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit, brothers; amen.|The phrase 'the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ' emphasizes the importance of grace in the Christian faith, highlighting the personal relationship between Jesus and the believers. The inclusion of 'with your spirit' suggests a deep connection with the inner being of the believers, which is a common theme in Pauline writings. The term 'brothers' is inclusive, referring to all believers, thereby fostering a sense of unity.|
