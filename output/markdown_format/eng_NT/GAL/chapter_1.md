The emphasis on being appointed by Jesus Christ and God the Father signifies the legitimacy and spiritual authority behind his mission, reinforcing the Christian belief in the divine call to service.|
|GAL 1:2|and all the brothers who are with me, to the churches of Galatia:|In this verse, the term 'brothers' emphasizes the familial bond among believers, suggesting a close-knit community in the Galatian churches. 'Churches of Galatia' indicates the geographical region, underlining the collective identity of the believers there. The phrase reflects the inclusivity and unity in Christ, which is a recurrent theme in Paul's letters.|

|GAL 1:5|to whom be glory forever and ever. Amen.|The phrase 'to whom be the glory' captures the eternal nature of God's glory, emphasizing both His sovereignty and the response of worship from believers.

|GAL 1:6|I am astonished that you are so quickly turning away from the one who called you in the grace of Christ to a different gospel.|This translation seeks to capture the urgency and astonishment expressed by Paul as he addresses the Galatians. The word 'quickly' conveys the rapidity with which they are departing from the truth of the gospel, highlighting the gravity of their situation. The phrase 'the one who called you in the grace of Christ' emphasizes the divine origin of their calling and contrasts it with the 'other gospel' they are turning to.|
|GAL 1:7|which is not another; but there are some who trouble you and want to pervert the gospel of Christ.|The verse emphasizes the distortion of the Gospel and the troubling influence of those who seek to lead believers astray.

If I were still trying to please men, I would not be a servant of Christ.|In this verse, Paul emphasizes his commitment to serving God over pleasing people. The use of the term 'pleasing' is pivotal in understanding the contrast he draws between divine obedience and human approval. This translation seeks to convey both the rhetorical questions and the emphatic nature of Paul's declaration regarding his identity as a servant of Christ.|
|GAL 1:11|But I want you to know, brothers, that the gospel I preached is not of human origin; it is divine in nature.|This verse emphasizes the divine origin of the gospel that Paul preaches, contrasting it with human wisdom or traditions.

|GAL 1:12|For I did not receive it from any human source, nor was I taught it; rather, it came to me through a revelation of Jesus Christ.|This verse emphasizes the divine origin of Paul's teachings and that they were not derived from human instruction.

|GAL 1:15|But when God, who set me apart from my mother’s womb and called me by His grace, was pleased to reveal His Son in me,|The translation emphasizes God's sovereign choice in setting apart and calling Paul, reflecting themes of divine election and grace that run throughout Scripture. The original Greek word 'ἂφορίσας' (set apart) and 'καλέσας' (called) are key in conveying Paul's understanding of his divine mission.|
|GAL 1:16|to reveal His Son in me, so that I might preach Him among the Gentiles. Immediately I did not consult with flesh and blood.|This verse emphasizes the immediate and divine revelation of Jesus Christ in the life of Paul, leading to his mission among the Gentiles.

|GAL 1:17|nor did I go up to Jerusalem to those who were apostles before me, but I went away to Arabia, and then returned again to Damascus.|The phrase 'nor did I go up to Jerusalem' indicates a deliberate absence from the apostles who were already there, emphasizing Paul’s independent calling.

|GAL 1:20|Now, what I write to you, behold, before God I declare that I do not lie.|The phrase 'I do not lie' is a strong assertion of truthfulness and sincerity, emphasizing the seriousness with which Paul approaches his message. It reflects the need for integrity and honesty in communication, particularly in matters of faith.|
|GAL 1:21|Then I went to the regions of Syria and Cilicia.|In this verse, Paul continues to recount his journey and ministry after his conversion. The mention of Syria and Cilicia indicates his movements and the geographical regions significant to early Christian missions. The term 'regions' (κλίματα) suggests specific areas rather than a general description, indicating an emphasis on his focused efforts in these areas as part of his apostolic work.|
|GAL 1:22|And I was still unknown in person to the churches of Judea that are in Christ.|In this verse, the phrase 'ἀγνοούμενος τῷ προσώπῳ' is translated to convey the idea of being unknown or unfamiliar by face among the churches in Judea. This captures Paul's experience of not being recognized personally by those in the region he refers to, emphasizing his transformation and the initial disbelief of others regarding his new identity in Christ.|
|GAL 1:23|They were only hearing that the one who once persecuted us is now preaching the faith that he once tried to destroy.|In this verse, Paul refers to the transformation of his life from being a persecutor of Christians to a proclaimer of the Gospel. The use of 'the one who used to persecute us' captures the profound change in identity and purpose.

|GAL 1:24|And they glorified God because of me.|The phrase "ἐδόξαζον ἐν ἐμοὶ τὸν Θεόν" can be understood as expressing the idea of others giving glory to God because of what they see in the transformed life of Paul.
