| Reference | Verse | Translation Notes |
|:---------:|-------|-------------------|
|GAL 5:1|For freedom Christ has set us free; stand firm therefore, and do not submit again to a yoke of slavery.|In this translation, the term 'freedom' emphasizes the liberation granted by Christ, and 'stand firm' reflects the imperative to maintain that freedom without returning to a state of bondage. The translation captures both the essence of spiritual freedom and the encouragement to persist in it.|
|GAL 5:2|Look, I, Paul, say to you that if you accept circumcision, Christ will be of no benefit to you.|The phrase 'if you accept circumcision' refers to adhering to the Jewish law for justification. Paul emphasizes that turning to the law negates the redemptive work of Christ, highlighting the danger of reverting to old practices that undermine grace.|
|GAL 5:3|And I testify again to every man who accepts circumcision, that he is obligated to keep the whole law.|In this verse, the Apostle Paul emphasizes that choosing to live under the law, specifically through the act of circumcision, places a person in a position where they are obligated to keep the entirety of the law. The term 'debtor' signifies that one is bound to fulfill all its requirements. This reflects the broader theme in Galatians about the futility of seeking righteousness through the law instead of faith in Christ.|
|GAL 5:4|You are severed from Christ, you who would be justified by the law; you have fallen away from grace.|This verse underscores the danger of relying on the law for justification, contrasting it with the grace that comes through faith in Christ. The phrase 'fallen away from grace' reflects a spiritual disconnection resulting from returning to legalism, emphasizing that true righteousness is not obtained through the law but through the grace of God.|
|GAL 5:5|For we, by the Spirit, await the hope of righteousness through faith.|In this verse, the phrase 'by the Spirit' emphasizes the role of the Holy Spirit in the life of the believer. The term 'hope of righteousness' refers to the expectation of being declared righteous before God, which comes through faith rather than the law. This captures the essence of faith as an active and expectant state, trusting in God's promises and the work of the Spirit.|
|GAL 5:6|For in Christ Jesus, neither circumcision nor uncircumcision counts for anything, but only faith working through love.|This verse emphasizes the futility of relying on physical acts of the law, such as circumcision, for one's spiritual standing. Instead, it highlights the centrality of faith, which is energized by love, as the true means of connection to Christ and righteousness.|
|GAL 5:7|You were running well; who hindered you from obeying the truth?|This verse expresses the theme of perseverance in the Christian faith and the challenge of distractions or hindrances that may cause believers to stray from the truth of the Gospel. The original Greek terms emphasize the importance of running well and being hindered from adhering to the truth.|
|GAL 5:8|This persuasion did not come from the one who calls you.|The Greek phrase "ἡ πεισμονὴ οὐκ ἐκ τοῦ καλοῦντος ὑμᾶς" translates to 'the persuasion is not from the one who calls you.' The term 'persuasion' reflects a strong influence or convincing, emphasizing that the source of this persuasion is not God. This translation seeks to clarify the source of the influence that led the Galatians away from their faith.|
|GAL 5:9|A little yeast leavens the entire batch of dough.|The phrase 'little yeast' symbolizes how a small influence can impact a much larger context, reflecting the potential for negative beliefs or behaviors to affect a whole community or church.|
|GAL 5:10|I am confident in you, in the Lord, that you will not think otherwise; but the one who is unsettling you will bear the judgment, whoever he may be.|In this verse, the apostle Paul expresses his confidence in the Galatian believers regarding their spiritual understanding and conduct, emphasizing the reliability of God’s judgment against those who cause division. The phrase 'in the Lord' signifies a shared faith and mutual encouragement in the Christian community.|
|GAL 5:11|But I, brothers, if I still preach circumcision, why am I still persecuted? In that case, the offense of the cross has been abolished.|This verse addresses the issue of circumcision and its implications for the Christian faith, particularly in relation to the cross of Christ and the scandal that arises from preaching a mixed message of law and grace. The use of 'scandalon' indicates a stumbling block that arises from the conflict between the grace of Christ and the demands of the law.|
|GAL 5:12|I wish those who unsettle you would cut themselves off.|This translation emphasizes the seriousness of the apostle Paul's feelings about those who disrupt the faith of believers. The term used suggests a strong desire for those who are misleading others to face the consequences of their actions. The phrase 'cut off' is metaphorical for being removed from community or influence, implying a severe judgment.|
|GAL 5:13|For you were called to freedom, brothers; only do not use your freedom as an opportunity for the flesh, but through love serve one another.|This verse emphasizes the call to live in the freedom that Christ provides, while also stressing that such freedom should not be misused for selfish desires but rather expressed through love and service to one another. The translation captures the balance between freedom and responsibility.|
|GAL 5:14|For the entire law is fulfilled in one word: ‘You shall love your neighbor as yourself.’|In this translation, emphasis is placed on the summation of the law through the concept of love, which aligns with the overall message of Galatians regarding the role of love in fulfilling God's commands. The term 'fulfilled' highlights the completeness of love in relation to the law, maintaining a consistent theological perspective.|
|GAL 5:15|But if you bite and devour one another, watch out that you are not consumed by one another.|In this translation, I aim to capture the gravity of Paul's warning against mutual harm among the believers. The words 'bite' and 'devour' convey a sense of destructive behavior that can occur when there is conflict within a community. The final phrase emphasizes the risk of being consumed by this behavior, underlining the necessity of mutual respect and love.|
|GAL 5:16|But I say, walk by the Spirit, and you will not fulfill the desires of the flesh.|This verse emphasizes the importance of living in accordance with the Holy Spirit, contrasting it with the desires of the flesh. The use of 'walk' signifies a continuous manner of life or behavior, encouraging believers to let the Spirit guide their actions to avoid succumbing to sinful desires.|
|GAL 5:17|For the flesh desires what is contrary to the Spirit, and the Spirit desires what is contrary to the flesh; these are in opposition to each other, so that you do not do what you would like to do.|This verse highlights the internal conflict between the desires of the flesh and the guidance of the Spirit. The term 'flesh' refers to the sinful nature that opposes spiritual living, while 'Spirit' refers to the Holy Spirit guiding believers toward godliness. The phrase 'that you may not do what you want' suggests a struggle between these two forces in the life of a believer.|
|GAL 5:18|But if you are guided by the Spirit, you are not under the law.|This verse contrasts being led by the Spirit with being under the law. The phrase 'led by the Spirit' emphasizes divine guidance rather than adherence to legalistic rules.|
|GAL 5:19|Now the deeds of the flesh are evident, which include adultery, fornication, uncleanness, and sensuality.|This verse lists the works of the flesh, emphasizing sinful actions that stem from human desires and corrupt nature. The terms used relate specifically to various forms of sexual immorality, highlighting the moral failings that are evident in one's life apart from the guidance of the Holy Spirit.|
|GAL 5:20|idolatry, sorcery, enmities, strife, jealousy, fits of anger, rivalries, dissensions, factions,|This verse lists various sinful behaviors associated with the flesh, particularly focusing on idolatry and discord, which are key issues addressed in the wider context of Galatians.|
|GAL 5:21|envy, murder, drunkenness, revelries, and other things like these, of which I forewarn you, as I also forewarned you before, that those who practice such things will not inherit the kingdom of God.|In this verse, Paul lists various behaviors associated with the flesh, emphasizing their incompatibility with inheriting the Kingdom of God. The terms chosen reflect both a moral decay and the serious consequences of living in such a manner. The reference to 'similar things' suggests a broader category of sins beyond just those listed, indicating a comprehensive warning against a life characterized by these vices.|
|GAL 5:22|But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness.|In this verse, the term 'fruit of the Spirit' refers to the natural outcome of a life lived in accordance with the Holy Spirit. Each quality listed represents a characteristic that should manifest in the life of a believer, showing the transformative power of God's presence. The words have been translated to maintain the essence and weight found in the original Greek text, reflecting a holistic view of spiritual maturity.|
|GAL 5:23|gentleness, self-control; against such things there is no law.|The terms 'meekness' (πρᾳότης) and 'self-control' (ἐγκράτεια) reflect the character qualities produced by the Holy Spirit in believers. The phrase 'against such things there is no law' implies that these virtues are not only acceptable but desirable, promoting a life led by the Spirit that transcends the constraints of the law.|
|GAL 5:24|And those who belong to Christ have crucified the flesh along with its passions and desires.|In this verse, Paul emphasizes the believer's identification with Christ in His death, particularly in relation to the passions and desires of the flesh. The use of 'crucified' signifies a definitive action of putting to death the sinful inclinations that oppose the life in the Spirit.|
|GAL 5:25|If we live by the Spirit, let us also walk in the Spirit.|This verse emphasizes the importance of living by the Spirit and not just in a superficial manner. The Greek term 'ζῶμεν' (we live) signifies a deep, ongoing relationship with the Spirit, suggesting a life characterized by the Spirit's influence. The phrase 'Πνεύματι καὶ στοιχῶμεν' indicates a continuous following or keeping in step with the Spirit, portraying a dynamic, active participation in the Spirit's guidance and leading.|
|GAL 5:26|Let us not become conceited, provoking one another, envying one another.|In this verse, the terms 'vain glory' (κενόδοξοι) and the admonitions against provoking or envying one another are critical for understanding the communal life expected in the body of Christ. The translation aims to capture the original tone of warning and instruction concerning interpersonal relationships among believers.|
