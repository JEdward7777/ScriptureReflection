| Reference | Verse | Translation Notes |
|:---------:|-------|-------------------|
|GAL 4:1|I mean that as long as the heir is a child, he is no different from a slave, though he is the owner of everything.|In this verse, the Apostle Paul emphasizes the condition of a child heir compared to a servant. The terms ‘child’ and ‘slave’ both reflect status, highlighting that a minor heir, although legally entitled to inheritance, is treated similarly to a servant until the appointed time of maturity. This serves to illustrate the spiritual condition of believers before they come into their inheritance as children of God.|
|GAL 4:2|but is under guardians and stewards until the time set by the father.|The terms 'guardians' and 'stewards' indicate a role of responsibility over the heir until the designated time. The phrase 'the set time of the father' reflects the idea of divine timing and authority over the estate, which is a central theme in understanding the maturation process from childhood to adulthood in a biblical context.|
|GAL 4:3|So also we, when we were children, were held in bondage under the elemental principles of the world.|In this verse, Paul compares the state of being spiritually immature to being under the bondage of elemental principles of the world. The term 'elements of the world' refers to the basic spiritual realities that govern human existence, suggesting that before coming to faith, we were subjected to these influences like children under guardianship.|
|GAL 4:4|But when the fullness of time had come, God sent forth His Son, born of a woman, born under the law.|This translation emphasizes the fullness of time and the significance of Christ's coming in relation to the law and humanity, maintaining a focus on divine action in sending His Son.|
|GAL 4:5|to redeem those who were under the law, that we might receive the adoption as sons.|This verse encapsulates the theological concept of redemption and adoption, emphasizing that through Christ's work, believers are liberated from the constraints of the law and granted the status of sons and daughters of God. The terms 'redemption' and 'adoption' are critical to understanding the full impact of the Christian gospel.|
|GAL 4:6|And because you are sons, God has sent forth the Spirit of His Son into your hearts, crying out, 'Abba, Father!'|This translation aims to capture the intimate relationship believers have with God through the Holy Spirit, emphasizing both the legal status of being adopted and the heartfelt cry of affection towards God as 'Father.' The term 'Abba' signifies an intimate, familial relationship, which is vital in understanding our position as sons of God.|
|GAL 4:7|Therefore, you are no longer a slave, but a son; and if a son, then an heir of God through Christ.|This verse emphasizes the transformation of believers from slaves to children of God through faith in Christ. The legal status of being a slave is contrasted with the relational status of being a son, indicating not just a change in position but also in identity and inheritance.|
|GAL 4:8|But at that time, when you did not know God, you served those who by nature are not gods.|This translation seeks to maintain the core meaning of the original text, emphasizing the transition from ignorance of God to a relationship with Him, and the folly of serving non-existent deities.|
|GAL 4:9|But now that you have come to know God, or rather are known by God, how can you turn back again to the weak and worthless elementary principles, to which you want to be enslaved all over again?|In this verse, Paul contrasts the believers' previous ignorance of God with their current knowledge of Him. The phrase 'weak and beggarly elements' refers to the rudimentary principles or religious observances that the Galatians are tempted to return to. The term 'known by God' emphasizes God's initiative in establishing a relationship with His people, highlighting the grace of God as the source of their knowledge.|
|GAL 4:10|You observe days and months and seasons and years!|In this translation, the emphasis is placed on the observance of days, months, seasons, and years as it relates to the Galatians' spiritual journey and the danger of reverting to legalistic practices after having experienced the freedom in Christ. The words chosen reflect both a concern for ritualism and a reminder of the new covenant in Christ.|
|GAL 4:11|I am concerned for you, lest my labor among you should be in vain.|In this verse, Paul expresses his concern for the Galatians regarding the efforts he has made in their spiritual lives. The phrase 'I fear for you' emphasizes his anxiety over their spiritual condition and the potential for his efforts to have been in vain. The term 'labor' suggests his hard work and dedication to their faith journey.|
|GAL 4:12|Become like me, for I became like you, brothers; I beg you. You have not wronged me at all.|In this verse, Paul expresses a deep desire for the Galatians to empathize with his situation. His plea emphasizes solidarity, suggesting that he has not wronged them but has shared in their experiences. The translation captures the relational aspect of his message and highlights his affection towards them.|
|GAL 4:13|You know that it was because of a physical infirmity that I preached the gospel to you at the first.|In this verse, the Apostle Paul refers to the circumstances under which he first preached the Gospel to the Galatians, emphasizing that he did so during a time of physical weakness. This acknowledges both the vulnerability of the human condition and the power of God's message even when delivered through frail vessels.|
|GAL 4:14|And you did not despise or reject my trial that was in my flesh; instead, you welcomed me as if I were an angel of God, as if I were Christ Jesus himself.|In this verse, Paul emphasizes the acceptance he received from the Galatians despite his physical affliction. The mention of receiving him 'as an angel of God' indicates the esteem and honor the Galatians showed towards him, which contrasts with their later treatment of him. The freshness of the translation seeks to capture the emotional depth of Paul's experience and the irony of their acceptance during a time of vulnerability.|
|GAL 4:15|What then has become of your blessedness? For I testify that, if possible, you would have gouged out your eyes and given them to me.|The term 'maKARISMOS' indicates a state of being blessed or highly favored, which correlates with the ideas of reward and joy found throughout the New Testament. The phrase about 'tearing out your eyes' suggests a hyperbolic expression of extreme sacrifice and devotion, underscoring the deep bond between Paul and the Galatian believers.|
|GAL 4:16|So have I become your enemy by telling you the truth?|In this verse, Paul poses a rhetorical question that emphasizes the conflict between truth and the perceptions of the Galatians. The use of 'enemy' indicates a dramatic shift from friendship to opposition that can occur when the truth is presented, suggesting that the Galatians may have turned against Paul for speaking the truth.|
|GAL 4:17|They are zealous for you, but not for good; they wish to shut you out, so that you may be zealous for them.|This verse expresses a concern regarding the intentions of those who are zealous for the Galatians. Paul highlights that their zeal is not benevolent but rather self-serving, aiming to isolate the Galatians from the true gospel.|
|GAL 4:18|But it is good to be zealous for a good cause at all times, and not just when I am present with you.|In this verse, the Apostle Paul emphasizes the importance of zeal that is directed towards what is good and beneficial. The contrast is drawn against mere enthusiasm that serves self-interest, which is a key theme in his letter to the Galatians.|
|GAL 4:19|My dear children, for whom I am again in the pains of childbirth until Christ is fully formed in you!|In this verse, Paul expresses deep concern and emotional investment in the spiritual development of the Galatians, portraying the process of nurturing their faith similarly to the labor pains of childbirth. The phrase 'until Christ is formed in you' highlights the transformative work of Christ within believers.|
|GAL 4:20|I wish I could be present with you now and change my tone, for I am perplexed about you.|The Greek word 'ἀποροῦμαι' indicates a state of perplexity or confusion. In this verse, the apostle Paul expresses his deep emotional struggle regarding the spiritual state of the Galatians. The phrase 'ἀλλάξαι τὴν φωνήν μου' suggests a desire to communicate in a different, perhaps more earnest tone due to this perplexity.|
|GAL 4:21|Tell me, you who desire to be under the law, do you not listen to the law?|In this verse, Paul is addressing those who desire to be under the law, questioning their understanding of it. The term 'law' (νόμος) reflects the Old Covenant given to Israel. Paul's rhetorical question challenges the notion that adhering to the law can bring about justification, a theme prominent throughout the epistle to the Galatians.|
|GAL 4:22|For it is written that Abraham had two sons, one by the bondwoman and the other by the freewoman.|This verse speaks to the two sons of Abraham representing two distinct covenants. The use of 'bondwoman' and 'freewoman' indicates the conditions under which each son was born, reflecting the broader theological themes of freedom and bondage in the context of the law versus grace.|
|GAL 4:23|But the one who was born of the bondwoman was born according to the flesh, and the one who was born of the freewoman was born through the promise.|In this verse, Paul contrasts the physical lineage stemming from Hagar, the bondwoman, with the spiritual lineage from Sarah, the freewoman, which is rooted in God’s promise. This distinction underscores the theme of freedom versus bondage in the believer's life.|
|GAL 4:24|These things are being interpreted allegorically. For these women are two covenants: one from Mount Sinai, which gives birth to slavery; this is Hagar.|In this verse, Paul emphasizes the allegorical significance of two covenants represented by the two women, one leading to bondage (Hagar) and the other to freedom (Sarah). The term 'allegorically' highlights a deeper spiritual understanding of these covenants.|
|GAL 4:25|For Hagar is Mount Sinai in Arabia; and she corresponds to the present Jerusalem, for she is in slavery with her children.|This verse speaks about Hagar representing the covenant of the Law and its association with the earthly Jerusalem. The metaphor of slavery is central to Paul's argument about the bondage of the Law versus the freedom found in Christ. The geographical reference to Mount Sinai connects the historical roots of the Law with the concept of spiritual slavery.|
|GAL 4:26|But the Jerusalem that is above is free, and she is our mother.|In this verse, 'the Jerusalem above' represents spiritual freedom and the maternal origin of all believers, contrasting with the bondage of earthly Jerusalem. The term 'mother' highlights the nurturing aspect of the heavenly city in relation to its children, the believers in Christ.|
|GAL 4:27|For it is written: "Rejoice, O barren one who does not bear; break forth and cry aloud, you who are not in labor! For the children of the desolate will be more than those of the one who has a husband."|This verse draws upon the imagery of barrenness and the promise of offspring, resonating with themes found in the prophecy of Isaiah. The contrast between the barren woman and the fruitful one symbolizes the transition from the old covenant, represented by the Jerusalem below, to the new covenant of freedom and life in Christ. The terms used reflect the shift from desolation to abundant life in God's family.|
|GAL 4:28|Now you, brothers, like Isaac, are children of promise.|In this verse, Paul draws a parallel between the believers and Isaac, who is the child of promise. The term 'children of promise' signifies a divine calling and a special status before God, emphasizing the spiritual lineage over physical descent.|
|GAL 4:29|But just as at that time the one born according to the flesh persecuted the one born according to the Spirit, so it is now.|This verse draws a parallel between the physical and spiritual realms, reflecting the ongoing tension between those born of the flesh and those born of the Spirit. The terms used convey a sense of persecution that can exist between these two groups, resonating with the story of Isaac and Ishmael.|
|GAL 4:30|But what does the Scripture say? "Cast out the slave woman and her son; for the son of the slave woman shall not inherit with the son of the free woman."|This verse references the story of Abraham's two sons, drawing a parallel between the two covenants: the old covenant associated with the slave woman (Hagar) and the new covenant associated with the free woman (Sarah). The imagery highlights the impossibility of sharing inheritance under these contrasting conditions. In this translation, the emphasis is on the exclusion of the son of the slave woman from the inheritance alongside the son of the free woman, underscoring the theme of the different covenants in the context of inheritance.|
|GAL 4:31|Therefore, brothers, we are not children of the bondwoman, but of the free woman.|In this verse, Paul contrasts the status of believers as free children rather than slaves, emphasizing their identity as heirs through the promise of freedom found in Christ. The word 'children' (τέκνα) implies a close, familial relationship, denoting both privilege and responsibility, while 'free woman' refers to the spiritual freedom provided through faith in Jesus.|
