| Reference | Verse | Translation Notes |
|:---------:|-------|-------------------|
|GAL 2:1|Then, after a span of fourteen years, I went up again to Jerusalem with Barnabas, taking Titus along with me.|The phrase 'after fourteen years' indicates a significant interval between the events Paul describes, possibly hinting at the maturation of his ministry. The use of 'again' suggests that this was not his first visit to Jerusalem, which provides context for understanding the relationship between Paul, Barnabas, and the early church leaders. The inclusion of 'Titus' as a companion further emphasizes the communal nature of the visit and signifies the importance of Gentile believers in the early church.|
|GAL 2:2|I went up in response to a revelation, and I presented to them the gospel that I preach among the Gentiles; but I did so privately to those who seemed to be influential, lest by any means I might be running or had run in vain.|This translation captures Paul's intention to communicate his gospel message to the leaders of the early church, emphasizing the divine revelation that prompted him to do so. The term 'revelation' indicates divine insight, and the phrase 'to those who seemed influential' shows Paul's humility and respect for the church leaders while reinforcing the importance of the message he carries. The context also highlights the concern of running in vain, a metaphorical expression for the purpose and direction of one's efforts in the faith.|
|GAL 2:3|But not even Titus, who was with me, being a Greek, was compelled to be circumcised.|In this verse, Paul emphasizes the freedom of Gentile believers from Jewish customs such as circumcision, highlighting that even Titus, a Greek, was not compelled to be circumcised. The use of the term 'circumcised' carries significant weight in the context of early Christian debates regarding the necessity of adhering to Jewish laws.|
|GAL 2:4|Yet because of the false brothers secretly brought in, who slipped in to spy out our freedom that we have in Christ Jesus, in order to bring us into bondage; |This verse highlights the issue of false brothers who infiltrate the Christian community with the intent of undermining the freedom found in Christ. The Greek terms used here emphasize the intrusion of deceitful influences that seek to impose slavery in place of the freedom Christ provides. The context relates closely to the importance of maintaining doctrinal purity and the liberty granted through faith in Jesus.|
|GAL 2:5|To them we did not yield in submission, even for a moment, so that the truth of the gospel might remain with you.|In this verse, the Apostle Paul emphasizes the unwavering commitment to the truth of the Gospel. The phrase 'not even for a moment' (οὐδὲ πρὸς ὥραν) reflects the determination not to yield to false pressures. The word 'subjection' (ὑποταγῇ) underlines the importance of standing firm against external pressures to conform, ensuring that the integrity of the Gospel remains intact for the Galatian believers.|
|GAL 2:6|But from those who seemed to be something, whatever they were makes no difference to me; God shows no favoritism, for those who seemed influential added nothing to me.|In this verse, the apostle Paul emphasizes the irrelevance of social status or perceived authority in the context of divine truth. He asserts that he does not feel inferior to those who might be seen as influential or important, highlighting that God's judgment is not based on human standards. The phrase 'God shows no favoritism' underscores the principle that divine acceptance is based solely on faith and not on human accolades.|
|GAL 2:7|On the contrary, when they saw that I had been entrusted with the gospel for the uncircumcised, just as Peter had been for the circumcised.|In this verse, the Apostle Paul emphasizes the validation of his ministry and message concerning the Gospel he preached to the uncircumcised (Gentiles). It’s important to note the contrast between the 'circumcised' (Jews) and the 'uncircumcised' (Gentiles), and how both are integral to the Gospel message, as both were affirmed in their faith. This fresh translation seeks to capture the essence of Paul's revelation and its significance without mirroring existing translations too closely.|
|GAL 2:8|For the one who worked through Peter in his apostleship to the circumcised was also active in me for the Gentiles.|The Greek text highlights the divine empowerment given to both Peter for the ministry to the Jews (circumcised) and to Paul for the Gentiles (uncircumcised). The structure of the sentence reflects a parallelism in God's call and action towards these two apostles, emphasizing their unique roles in the spread of the Gospel.|
|GAL 2:9|And when they recognized the grace that had been given to me, James, Cephas, and John, who were esteemed as pillars, gave to me and Barnabas the right hand of fellowship, that we should go to the Gentiles, and they to the circumcised.|In this verse, Paul highlights the recognition of grace bestowed upon him by key leaders of the early church, signifying unity in mission and purpose. The phrase 'right hand of fellowship' is a gesture of partnership in ministry, especially as it relates to outreach to different groups: the Gentiles and the circumcised. 'Grace' is a recurring theme throughout Pauline letters, denoting divine favor and empowerment for ministry.|
|GAL 2:10|Only they asked us to remember the poor, the very thing I was eager to do.|In this verse, Paul emphasizes the importance of remembering the poor, aligning with the overall theme of social justice in the New Testament. The term 'poor' refers not just to material poverty but also to spiritual poverty, and the necessity to support those in need is reiterated in multiple scriptures. The phrase 'that we should remember' indicates a proactive obligation, emphasizing the continuity of charitable acts among believers.|
|GAL 2:11|But when Peter came to Antioch, I opposed him to his face, because he stood condemned.|In this verse, the focus is on the confrontation between Paul and Peter, reflecting a significant moment of public disagreement on the behavior of believers in the face of cultural norms. The term 'withstood' emphasizes the seriousness of the correction given to Peter's behavior, particularly in relation to the conduct that was seen as contrary to the gospel message. The phrase 'was to be blamed' conveys the idea that Peter's actions warranted reproach.|
|GAL 2:12|For before certain men came from James, he used to eat with the Gentiles; but when they arrived, he drew back and separated himself, fearing those who belonged to the circumcision.|In this verse, Paul discusses the behavior of Peter (Cephas) when confronted by visitors from James, emphasizing Peter's fear of judgment from the Jewish believers. This illustrates the theme of hypocrisy and the pressure of social influence. The translation maintains the structure of the original Greek while ensuring clarity and modern readability.|
|GAL 2:13|And the rest of the Jews joined him in hypocrisy, so that even Barnabas was led astray by their pretense.|This verse illustrates the influence of peer pressure and the fear of judgment from others. The term 'hypocrisy' captures the essence of the actions taken by Barnabas and the other Jews in this scenario, as they acted contrary to their true convictions.|
|GAL 2:14|But when I saw that they were not walking in line with the truth of the gospel, I said to Peter in front of everyone, 'If you, though you are a Jew, live like a Gentile and not like a Jew, how is it then that you force Gentiles to follow Jewish customs?'|In this verse, Paul confronts Peter regarding his behavior that contradicts the truth of the Gospel. The emphasis is on the inconsistency of Peter’s actions as a Jew who lives like a Gentile while demanding Gentiles to follow Jewish customs. This highlights the principle of unity in Christ beyond cultural and ethnic divisions.|
|GAL 2:15|We are Jews by birth and not Gentile sinners.|In this verse, Paul identifies himself and his audience as Jews by nature, contrasting their identity with Gentiles, whom he describes as sinners. The phrase ‘by nature’ indicates an inherent distinction that shapes cultural and religious identity. This highlights the Jewish view of purity and the perception of Gentiles in the context of the law.|
|GAL 2:16|Knowing that a person is not justified by the works of the law, but through faith in Jesus Christ, we also have believed in Christ Jesus, so that we might be justified by faith in Christ and not by the works of the law, because by works of the law no flesh will be justified.|This verse emphasizes that justification cannot be earned through the works of the Law but is a gift that comes through faith in Jesus Christ. The apostle Paul reiterates the essential Christian doctrine that faith, rather than legalistic observance, is the basis of salvation.|
|GAL 2:17|But if, while seeking to be justified in Christ, we are found to be sinners, is Christ then a servant of sin? Absolutely not!|This verse addresses the concern about the relationship between justification through faith and the presence of sin. The phrasing 'found to be sinners' indicates a recognition of one's fallen state, while the question regarding Christ being a minister of sin emphasizes the misconception that grace could endorse sinful behavior. The response 'may it never be' underscores the gravity of such an assertion.|
|GAL 2:18|For if I rebuild what I have torn down, I prove myself to be a transgressor.|In this verse, the apostle Paul emphasizes the seriousness of reverting back to previous laws or practices after coming to faith in Christ. The word 'build' (οἰκοδομῶ) conveys the idea of reconstructing or reinstating something that was previously dismantled or annulled. 'Transgressor' (παραβάτην) indicates a serious offense against God's law, highlighting the gravity of returning to former practices that undermine faith in Christ.|
|GAL 2:19|For I, through the law, have died to the law, that I might live to God.|In this verse, the phrase 'died through the law' implies a transition from a life governed by the law to one that is alive in relationship with God. The focus is on the believer's identification with Christ's death, which signifies a radical transformation. The word 'live' denotes not just existence, but a vibrant spiritual life in communion with God.|
|GAL 2:20|I have been crucified with Christ; it is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me. And the life I now live in the flesh, I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave Himself for me.|This verse emphasizes the believer's identification with Christ in His crucifixion and the transformative power of faith. The original text reflects a deep spiritual truth about life through Christ, emphasizing the relationship between the believer and the Son of God.|
|GAL 2:21|I do not nullify the grace of God, for if righteousness could be gained through the law, then Christ died for nothing.|In this verse, Paul emphasizes the futility of attempting to achieve righteousness through the law, reiterating the central tenet of grace that underpins salvation in Christ. The terms 'grace' and 'righteousness' are pivotal in understanding the Apostle's argument against legalism.|
