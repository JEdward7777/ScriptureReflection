| Reference | Verse | Translation Notes |
|:---------:|-------|-------------------|
|GAL 3:1|O foolish Galatians! Who has cast a spell on you, before whose eyes Jesus Christ was publicly portrayed as crucified?|In this verse, Paul expresses a deep frustration with the Galatians for being misled. The term 'ἀνόητοι' conveys a sense of foolishness or lack of understanding, while 'ἐβάσκανε' indicates being bewitched or deceived. Paul is emphasizing the clear evidence of Christ's crucifixion and the central truth of the gospel that should guide their faith.|
|GAL 3:2|This is the only thing I want to learn from you: Did you receive the Spirit by the works of the law, or by hearing with faith?|In this verse, Paul emphasizes the distinction between receiving the Holy Spirit through the works of the Law versus by faith, highlighting the importance of belief in Christ for salvation. The Greek term 'ἀκοῆς πίστεως' (hearing of faith) is interpreted to mean the message of the gospel received by faith, contrasting with the action of the Law.|
|GAL 3:3|Are you so foolish? Having begun in the Spirit, are you now being made perfect by the flesh?|This verse addresses the inconsistency of starting one's journey of faith through the Spirit and then attempting to continue it through human effort or fleshly means. It serves as a rhetorical question emphasizing the folly of such a stance.|
|GAL 3:4|Did you suffer so many things in vain? If indeed it was in vain.|In this verse, Paul expresses incredulity at the Galatians' suffering for the sake of their faith, questioning whether it was all for nothing. The term 'suffered' indicates trials endured for the sake of the Gospel, and the repetition of 'for no purpose' underscores the seriousness of the issue.|
|GAL 3:5|Therefore, the One who supplies you with the Spirit and performs miracles among you, does He do this by the works of the law or by the hearing of faith?|This verse emphasizes the source of the Spirit and the working of miracles among the believers, contrasting the role of the law with that of faith. The use of 'ἐπιχορηγῶν' conveys the idea of providing or supplying, indicating that the Holy Spirit is given freely and not as a result of legalistic adherence to the law. The phrase 'ἐξ ἔργων νόμου ἢ ἐξ ἀκοῆς πίστεως' is crucial in delineating two contrasting paths: the works of the law versus the hearing of faith.|
|GAL 3:6|Just as Abraham believed God, and it was credited to him as righteousness.|This translation emphasizes the faith of Abraham and the concept of righteousness being attributed through belief, which is a central theme in Paul's argument in Galatians.|
|GAL 3:7|Understand then that those who have faith are the true children of Abraham.|This verse emphasizes the concept of faith as the determining factor in becoming a child of Abraham. It reflects the idea of spiritual lineage based on faith rather than ethnic descent, aligning with Paul's argument in Galatians regarding the nature of true children of God.|
|GAL 3:8|And the Scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the nations by faith, proclaimed the good news in advance to Abraham, saying, 'All nations will be blessed through you.'|This verse emphasizes the prophetic role of Scripture in revealing God's plan for the nations, highlighting faith as the means of justification and God's promise to Abraham as a source of blessing for all nations.|
|GAL 3:9|So those who are of faith are blessed along with Abraham, the man of faith.|This translation emphasizes the connection between faith and the blessings that come through Abraham. It reflects the original Greek text's focus on the concept of blessings associated with faith and identifies those who believe as part of Abraham's legacy.|
|GAL 3:10|For all who rely on the works of the law are under a curse; for it is written, ‘Cursed is everyone who does not continue to do everything written in the Book of the Law.’|This translation emphasizes the seriousness of living under the law and the consequences of failing to adhere to it fully. It highlights the universal application of the curse for those who rely on the works of the law for justification, which stands in contrast to the blessing received through faith.|
|GAL 3:11|But it is evident that no one is justified before God by the law, for ‘the righteous will live by faith.’|This verse highlights the futility of seeking justification through the law, emphasizing that true righteousness comes from faith. The use of 'righteous' and 'faith' is pivotal to understanding Paul’s argument against legalism in the context of the gospel.|
|GAL 3:12|But the law is not based on faith; rather, the one who does these things will live by them.|The translation emphasizes the distinction between faith and the law. The phrase 'the man who does them will live by them' reflects the Jewish understanding that adherence to the law is essential for life, whereas faith is highlighted as the means of true justification before God.|
|GAL 3:13|Christ has redeemed us from the curse of the Law by becoming a curse for us; for it is written, 'Cursed is everyone who is hung on a tree.'|This verse emphasizes the sacrificial role of Christ in redeeming humanity from the curse of the Law, reflecting the theme of substitutionary atonement found throughout the New Testament. The phrase 'under the curse' refers back to the Deuteronomic law about curses associated with disobedience, particularly the one concerning those who are hanged on a tree, which is a clear reference to Christ's crucifixion.|
|GAL 3:14|so that the blessing of Abraham might come to the Gentiles through Christ Jesus, so that we might receive the promised Spirit through faith.|In this verse, the connection between the blessing of Abraham and the role of Christ in extending that blessing to the Gentiles is emphasized. The term 'blessing' indicates a divine favor that comes through faith, rather than through the law. The 'promise of the Spirit' refers to the Holy Spirit, which believers receive by faith, highlighting the centrality of faith in receiving God's gifts.|
|GAL 3:15|Brothers, I speak in human terms: even a man’s covenant, once confirmed, cannot be annulled or added to.|The term 'man' in the Greek text (ἄνθρωπος) implies human authority and contracts, indicating that the context refers to human agreements which, once established, should not be invalidated or modified. The word 'covenant' (διαθήκην) here denotes a formal agreement, often with legal implications, emphasizing the binding nature of such pacts, especially in relation to God's promises.|
|GAL 3:16|Now to Abraham were the promises spoken, and to his seed. It does not say, 'and to seeds,' as of many, but as of one, 'and to your seed,' who is Christ.|In this verse, the Apostle Paul emphasizes the singularity of the promise made to Abraham and specifically to his seed, identifying that this seed refers to Christ. The distinction between 'seed' and 'seeds' highlights that the promise is fulfilled through one individual, rather than many descendants. This is key to understanding the relationship between the covenant and the fulfillment of God’s promise in Jesus Christ.|
|GAL 3:17|What I mean is this: the covenant previously ratified by God in Christ cannot be annulled by the Law that came 430 years later, so as to invalidate the promise.|In this verse, the apostle Paul emphasizes the permanence of God's covenant established with Abraham, contrasting it with the law given 430 years later. The focus is on the faithfulness of God's promise and how the law does not invalidate that promise. The Greek word for 'covenant' (διαθήκη) carries a connotation of an unbreakable agreement. The translation aims to reflect both the theological significance and the clarity of this teaching.|
|GAL 3:18|For if the inheritance comes from the Law, it no longer comes from the promise; but God granted it to Abraham by a promise.|In this verse, Paul emphasizes that the inheritance promised to Abraham is not derived from the Law, but solely from the promise made by God. The key terms of 'inheritance' and 'promise' are pivotal in understanding the distinction between the covenant of grace and the Law.|
|GAL 3:19|What then is the purpose of the Law? It was added for the sake of transgressions, until the promised Seed should come, being ordained through angels by the hand of a mediator.|In this translation, I have aimed to capture the nuances of the original Greek text, emphasizing the temporary nature of the Law as a means of addressing transgressions until the arrival of the promised seed, Christ. The use of 'mediator' reflects the role of angels as agents of the Law's delivery.|
|GAL 3:20|Now a mediator does not mediate for one only, but God is one.|This translation emphasizes the singularity of God in contrast to the role of the mediator. The phrase 'there is a mediator' suggests a representative role that is necessary in some circumstances, while 'there is one God' affirms the unity and singularity of God's essence. The original Greek structure is maintained to reflect the emphatic nature of the statement.|
|GAL 3:21|Is the law then against the promises of God? Absolutely not! For if a law had been given that could impart life, then righteousness would certainly have come by the law.|This translation captures the essence of Paul's argument about the role of the law in relation to God's promises and righteousness. It emphasizes the impossibility of the law providing life and righteousness on its own, directing attention towards faith in God's promises.|
|GAL 3:22|But the Scriptures have confined all things under sin, so that the promise might be given through faith in Jesus Christ to those who believe.|In this translation, I have emphasized the inclusiveness of sin as stated in the original text and the purpose of the promise being tied to faith in Christ. The word 'enclosed' is chosen to convey the idea of being bound under sin, while 'the promise' directly refers to God's promise fulfilled through faith rather than through adherence to the law.|
|GAL 3:23|But before faith came, we were held in custody under the law, being confined until the faith that was to be revealed.|In this verse, the concept of being 'guarded' or 'kept' under the law until the revelation of faith in Christ is highlighted. The use of 'under' denotes a state of restriction, akin to being under guard or in confinement, while 'faith' signifies the essential trust in God that comes with the arrival of Christ. The phrase 'that is to be revealed' indicates a future anticipation that is central to the understanding of faith in the Christian context.|
|GAL 3:24|So the law became our tutor to lead us to Christ, that we might be justified by faith.|In this translation, 'the law' is understood as a tutor or guide, leading to the revelation of Christ, emphasizing the transition from the law to faith as the basis for justification.|
|GAL 3:25|But now that faith has come, we are no longer under a guardian.|This verse signifies a transition from the role of the law as a guardian or tutor to the reality of living by faith, as believers are now guided by their faith in Christ rather than by the constraints of the law.|
|GAL 3:26|For you are all children of God through faith in Christ Jesus.|This translation reflects the original Greek text's emphasis on identity through faith, clarifying that all believers, irrespective of their background, are regarded as children of God through their faith in Jesus Christ.|
|GAL 3:27|For as many of you as were baptized into Christ have clothed yourselves with Christ.|The verse emphasizes the transformative nature of baptism into Christ, indicating that believers not only identify with Him but are also 'clothed' with His righteousness. The original text uses the verb 'ἐνεδύσασθε' (you have put on), which connotes a complete change in identity and state for those who have been baptized.|
|GAL 3:28|There is neither Jew nor Greek, slave nor free, male nor female; for you are all one in Christ Jesus.|This translation emphasizes the radical unity that believers share in Christ, irrespective of social, ethnic, or gender distinctions. The phrase 'all are one in Christ Jesus' highlights the transformative effect of faith and baptism, calling attention to the new identity formed through their relationship with Christ.|
|GAL 3:29|And if you belong to Christ, then you are Abraham's seed, heirs according to the promise.|This translation emphasizes the unity of believers in Christ and their status as heirs according to the promise made to Abraham. The use of 'seed' connects to the covenantal promise and the inclusivity of all who belong to Christ.|
