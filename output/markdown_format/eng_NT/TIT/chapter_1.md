|TIT 1:1|Paul, a servant of God and an apostle of Jesus Christ, for the faith of God’s chosen ones and the knowledge of the truth that leads to godliness.|In this verse, Paul identifies himself as both a servant of God and an apostle of Jesus Christ, emphasizing his role in conveying the faith of the elect and the knowledge of truth that aligns with godliness. The term 'servant' (δοῦλος) indicates a position of submission and dedication to God's will, while 'apostle' (ἀπόστολος) denotes his commission to spread the gospel. The reference to 'faith of the elect' highlights the belief held by those chosen by God, and 'knowledge of the truth' suggests a deep understanding that leads to godly living.|
|TIT 1:2|in hope of eternal life, which God, who cannot lie, promised before the ages began.|In this verse, the term "ἐλπίδι" (hope) is central to the concept of eternal life, emphasizing a confident expectation in God's promise. The phrase "ἀψευδὴς Θεὸς" (God, who cannot lie) underlines God's faithfulness in fulfilling His promises. The context indicates a promise made long before its revelation, thus connecting past eternity to the present assurance of life.|
|TIT 1:3|But at the proper times He revealed His word through preaching, which I was entrusted with by the command of our Savior, God.|In this translation, the emphasis is placed on the manifestation of God's word through specific appointed times. The term 'preaching' is used to reflect the public declaration of the message. The phrase 'according to the command of our Savior God' encapsulates the authority behind the proclamation.|
|TIT 1:4|To Titus, my true child in our common faith: Grace, mercy, and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Savior.|The verse emphasizes the close relationship between Paul and Titus, referring to him as a 'genuine child' in the faith, indicating a deep spiritual bond. The greeting reflects traditional Christian blessings of grace, mercy, and peace, which originate from God the Father and Jesus Christ, highlighting the divine source of these blessings.|
|TIT 1:5|For this reason, I left you in Crete, so that you might put what remains in order and appoint elders in every town, as I directed you.|The term 'elder' (πρεσβυτέρους) is translated as 'elders' to maintain the plural sense indicating a group of leaders. The word 'appoint' captures the act of establishing these leaders in their roles, reflecting the authority and responsibility imparted to Titus.|
|TIT 1:6|If anyone is blameless, the husband of one wife, having faithful children not accused of rebellion or disorder.|The phrase 'husband of one wife' indicates a requirement for fidelity and commitment in marriage, while 'faithful children' underscores the importance of having a family that aligns with Christian values. The terms 'above reproach' and 'not accused of dissipation or insubordination' emphasize moral integrity and proper conduct, which are critical for church leaders.|
|TIT 1:7|For an overseer must be blameless, as a steward of God; not self-willed, not quick-tempered, not given to wine, not violent, not greedy for dishonest gain.|This translation captures the essential qualities required for an overseer as outlined in the original Greek text. The adjectives chosen reflect both moral integrity and personal demeanor, aligning with the biblical emphasis on character and conduct in leadership roles.|
|TIT 1:8|But he must be hospitable, a lover of good, self-controlled, just, holy, and disciplined.|The terms used in this verse reflect key virtues expected of a leader within the church. The fresh translation aims to capture the essence of these qualities, emphasizing the character traits essential for spiritual oversight.|
|TIT 1:9|He must hold firmly to the trustworthy message as it has been taught, so that he can encourage others by sound doctrine and refute those who oppose it.|The term 'holding firm' translates ἀντεχόμενον, indicating a strong grasp of the doctrine. The phrase 'sound doctrine' captures the essence of the original teaching as being both healthy and beneficial for spiritual growth. The emphasis on 'exhorting' and 'rebuking' reflects the necessary role of leaders in the church to guide and correct others based on the truth.|
|TIT 1:10|For there are many rebellious individuals, full of empty talk and deception, especially those of the circumcision.|The term 'ανυπότακτοι' is translated as 'rebellious' to convey the sense of those who are not in submission to authority. 'ματαιολόγοι' suggests an emphasis on worthless talk or chatter that lacks substance, and 'φρεναπάται' denotes deceitful or misleading individuals. This verse emphasizes the presence of false teachers, particularly among the circumcision group, highlighting their characteristics.|
|TIT 1:11|They must be silenced, for they are upsetting entire households by teaching things they ought not to teach for the sake of dishonest gain.|The term 'οὓς δεῖ ἐπιστομίζειν' implies a need for strong correction or rebuke towards certain individuals who are leading others astray. The phrase 'ἃ μὴ δεῖ' emphasizes the inappropriate nature of their teachings. This translation captures the essence of these concepts while reflecting the tone of authority present in the original text.|
|TIT 1:12|One of them, a prophet from their own, has said, 'Cretans are always liars, evil beasts, lazy gluttons.'|This verse cites a Cretan prophet to underscore the deceptive nature of some teachers and their harmful behavior. The description reflects cultural perceptions of the Cretans at the time, and emphasizes the moral decline represented by such figures. Key terms like 'liars,' 'beasts,' and 'lazy gluttons' draw attention to the seriousness of their conduct.|
|TIT 1:13|This testimony is true. Therefore, rebuke them sharply, so that they may be sound in the faith.|In this verse, the Apostle Paul emphasizes the importance of firm correction in response to the falsehoods and negative behavior prevalent among the Cretans. The phrase 'rebuke them sharply' captures the urgency of maintaining sound faith and doctrine. The translation aims to reflect the seriousness with which such corrections are to be made to ensure that the recipients become healthy in their faith.|
|TIT 1:14|not paying attention to Jewish myths and the commands of men who turn away from the truth.|This translation emphasizes the rejection of Jewish myths and human commands that distort the truth. The term 'Jewish myths' reflects the context of the early church confronting false teachings, while 'commands of men' signifies human traditions that diverge from the truth of the gospel.|
|TIT 1:15|To the pure, all things are pure, but to those who are corrupted and unbelieving, nothing is pure; both their minds and consciences are defiled.|This verse contrasts the perceptions of purity among the faithful and those who are defiled. It emphasizes that to those who are clean, all things are clean, whereas for the polluted and unbelievers, nothing is clean, reflecting the internal state of their minds and consciences.|
|TIT 1:16|They profess to know God, but by their deeds they deny Him, being detestable, disobedient, and worthless for every good work.|In this verse, the contrast is drawn between mere profession of faith in God and the reality of one’s actions. The term ‘acknowledge’ reflects a superficial recognition of God, while ‘deny’ through their works emphasizes that true belief is manifested in actions. This translation aims to convey the essence of hypocrisy present in the passage, as well as the rejection of true goodness by those who do not genuinely follow God’s ways.|
