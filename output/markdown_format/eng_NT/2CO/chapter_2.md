| Reference | Verse | Translation Notes |
|:---------:|-------|-------------------|
|2CO 2:1|So I decided within myself that I would not come to you again in sorrow.|This translation reflects the emotional weight of the Apostle Paul's intention not to return to the Corinthians in sorrow. The phrase 'not to come again in sorrow' emphasizes the desire for a joyful reunion rather than one marked by sadness. This aligns with the broader theme of Paul's letter, focusing on reconciliation and joy in the faith community.|
|2CO 2:2|For if I cause you sorrow, who then can bring me joy, except the one whom I have made sorrowful?|This verse reflects Paul’s concern for the emotional state of the Corinthian church. He articulates a dilemma: if he brings them sorrow, it is paradoxical, as he also seeks to be comforted by their joy. This conveys the interconnectedness of joy and sorrow in relationships within the body of Christ.|
|2CO 2:3|And I wrote to you this very thing, so that when I came I would not be saddened by those who ought to make me rejoice, for I am confident that my joy is the joy of all of you.|This verse emphasizes the connection between the joy of the Apostle Paul and the joy of the believers. The intent is to express the significance of mutual joy within the community of faith, as well as the emotional impact that the Corinthian church has on him. It reflects Paul's pastoral concern and hope that his relationship with them would be one of joy rather than sorrow.|
|2CO 2:4|For out of much affliction and distress of heart I wrote to you with many tears, not to grieve you, but so that you might know the abundant love I have for you.|This translation seeks to convey Paul's emotional state and his intention behind writing. The term 'affliction' is used to parallel 'θλίψεως' (thlipsis), which refers to distress or trouble, while 'love' reflects Paul's deeper motivation behind his tears and writing. The phrase 'abundant love' captures 'περισσοτέρως' (perissoterōs) indicating the intensity of his feelings toward the Corinthians.|
|2CO 2:5|But if anyone has caused grief, he has not so much grieved me as he has grieved all of you, to some extent, in order not to overstate the burden.|In this verse, Paul addresses the emotional impact of the previous actions of the Corinthians. He clarifies that the sorrow caused does not stem from him personally but rather from their communal response to sin. This fresh translation maintains the nuance of Paul's intention to lessen their burden while recognizing the emotional weight of the situation.|
|2CO 2:6|This punishment by the majority is sufficient for such a person.|This verse addresses the appropriateness of discipline within the church community. The term 'punishment' or 'penalty' relates to a collective response from the congregation, emphasizing the necessity for accountability while maintaining a spirit of restoration.|
|2CO 2:7|so you should rather forgive and comfort him, so that he may not be overwhelmed by excessive sorrow.|In this translation, I emphasize the themes of forgiveness and encouragement, reflecting the original Greek terms while maintaining clarity in English. The term 'forgive' (χαρίσασθαι) implies an act of grace, while 'to comfort' (παρακαλέσαι) highlights the need for encouragement rather than condemnation, particularly after the punitive action mentioned in the previous verse.|
|2CO 2:8|Therefore, I urge you to reaffirm your love for him.|The Greek word 'κυρῶσαι' (kurōsai) implies an act of confirmation or affirmation, especially regarding the act of loving someone. This translation captures the essence of encouraging a communal act of love towards someone who has been hurt, building on the previous context of forgiveness.|
|2CO 2:9|For this reason, I also wrote to you, to see if you would prove your obedience in all things.|The word ' δοκιμὴν' relates to testing or proving, emphasizing the importance of obedience and faithfulness. This verse reveals Paul's intention to assess the Corinthians' obedience as a means of validating their faith and commitment.|
|2CO 2:10|And if you forgive anyone, I also forgive. For what I have forgiven, if I have forgiven anything, it is for your sake in the presence of Christ.|In this verse, the concept of forgiveness is paramount, highlighting the reciprocal nature of grace given among believers, emphasizing Christ as the central figure in such grace.|
|2CO 2:11|so that we would not be outwitted by Satan; for we are not unaware of his designs.|The phrase 'not to be outwitted by Satan' captures the essence of the original Greek term 'πλεονεκτηθῶμεν ὑπὸ τοῦ σατανᾶ', emphasizing the need for vigilance against his schemes. The use of 'unaware' for 'ἀγνοοῦμεν' conveys the idea of not being ignorant of his tactics, reflecting the believer's call to be discerning and proactive in their faith.|
|2CO 2:12|Now when I came to Troas to preach the gospel of Christ, and a door was opened for me in the Lord,|This verse highlights the importance of proclaiming the Gospel and emphasizes the open door provided by the Lord for ministry. The phrase 'an open door' metaphorically refers to opportunities for spreading the message of Christ. The context indicates a deep concern for the success of the Gospel, contrasting with any obstacles or opposition that may arise.|
|2CO 2:13|I had no rest for my spirit, because I did not find my brother Titus there. So I took my leave of them and went on to Macedonia.|In this verse, Paul expresses his deep concern for the well-being of Titus, indicating that the absence of news about him caused unrest in his spirit. The word 'rest' (ἄνεσιν) implies a state of tranquility that was disturbed by the absence of a brother in faith.|
|2CO 2:14|But thanks be to God, who always leads us in triumphal procession in Christ and manifests through us the sweet aroma of the knowledge of Him in every place.|In this verse, Paul emphasizes the triumphant nature of God's work through Christ, highlighting both victory and the spreading of knowledge. The words 'triumph' and 'fragrance' metaphorically represent the glory of Christ and the spread of the gospel.|
|2CO 2:15|For we are the aroma of Christ to God among those who are being saved and among those who are perishing.|In this verse, the metaphor of 'fragrance' or 'aroma' is used to illustrate the impact of Christ on believers and their witness to the world. The term 'sweet aroma' suggests a pleasing and acceptable offering to God, echoing the sacrificial language found throughout the New Testament. The distinction between those who are being saved and those who are perishing highlights the transformative power of the Gospel and its dual reception among people.|
|2CO 2:16|To some, we are the fragrance of death leading to death; to others, the fragrance of life leading to life. And who is adequate for such a task?|The terms 'aroma' and 'life' are juxtaposed with 'death' to convey the contrast between the effects of the Gospel on different people. This verse illustrates the dual response to the message of Christ, emphasizing both salvation and condemnation. The rhetorical question at the end reflects the weight of the task and the inadequacy of human ability to measure up to such a divine calling.|
|2CO 2:17|For we are not like many who peddle the word of God; rather, we speak with sincerity, as from God, and in the presence of God, we speak in Christ.|In this verse, Paul contrasts himself and his companions with those who handle God's word deceitfully. The term 'capers' implies a trade, suggesting a mercenary or dishonest approach to ministry. Paul emphasizes integrity and divine authority in their ministry in Christ, asserting their sincere communication as coming directly from God, and in His presence.|
