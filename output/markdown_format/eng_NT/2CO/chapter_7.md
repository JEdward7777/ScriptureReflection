| Reference | Verse | Translation Notes |
|:---------:|-------|-------------------|
|2CO 7:1|Therefore, beloved, since we have these promises, let us cleanse ourselves from every defilement of body and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God.|The verse emphasizes the importance of spiritual and moral purity as a response to the promises of God. The term 'moral impurity' refers not only to physical actions but also to spiritual states, highlighting a holistic approach to sanctification that encompasses both body and spirit. 'Holiness' in this context is understood as living in a way that reflects God's nature, pursued in reverent fear of Him.|
|2CO 7:2|Make room for us in your hearts; we have wronged no one, we have corrupted no one, we have exploited no one.|In this verse, Paul emphasizes his integrity and the uprightness of his conduct towards the Corinthians. The original Greek words convey a strong sense of not wronging or exploiting anyone, which aligns with the ethical teachings found in other New Testament letters.|
|2CO 7:3|I do not say this to condemn you; for I have said before that you are in our hearts, to die together and to live together.|The verse emphasizes the deep emotional connection Paul has with the Corinthians, indicating a shared life and mutual affection. The Greek terms for 'hearts' and 'living together' suggest a profound bond beyond mere acquaintance.|
|2CO 7:4|I have great confidence in you; I have much to boast about regarding you. I am filled with comfort, and my joy overflows in all our afflictions.|This verse expresses a deep sense of joy and confidence stemming from the Apostle Paul's relationship with the Corinthian believers. The key terms include 'confidence' (παρρησία), 'boasting' (καύχησις), 'comfort' (παρακλήσει), and 'joy' (χαρᾷ), each emphasizing a personal and communal experience in the context of affliction. The verse conveys an overwhelming emotional state resulting from the faithful endurance in trials.|
|2CO 7:5|For indeed, when we came to Macedonia, we had no rest for our bodies, but were afflicted in every way; outside were conflicts, inside were fears.|The Greek term 'θλίβομαι' signifies a state of distress or pressure, which Paul expresses in his feeling of no rest in Macedonia. The duality of 'μάχαι' (fights) and 'φόβοι' (fears) illustrates both external and internal struggles faced by believers, a theme present throughout Paul's letters.|
|2CO 7:6|But God, who comforts the humble, encouraged us by the coming of Titus.|In this translation, I aimed to convey the deep sense of comfort and encouragement found in the Lord, particularly as experienced through the presence of Titus among the believers. The term 'comforts' was chosen to reflect the original Greek term ὁ παρακαλῶν, emphasizing God’s active role in providing encouragement and support.|
|2CO 7:7|Not only by his coming, but also by the comfort with which he was comforted in you, as he told us of your longing, your sorrow, and your zeal for me, so that I rejoiced even more.|This verse emphasizes the emotional bond between Paul and the Corinthian believers. The words 'longing', 'grief', and 'zeal' highlight the deep connections and concerns shared in the community of faith. The term 'comfort' relates back to the encouragement mentioned earlier, demonstrating the cycle of support within the church.|
|2CO 7:8|For even if I made you sorrowful by my letter, I do not regret it, though I did regret it at first; for I see that the letter has caused you grief, though only for a while.|This translation reflects the Apostle Paul's mixed emotions regarding his letter to the Corinthians. While he recognizes that his previous letter caused them sorrow, he affirms his decision to write it, believing it ultimately served a greater purpose in their spiritual growth. The term 'regret' is nuanced, indicating a sense of sorrow for causing pain but not wishing to retract his message as it was necessary for their transformation.|
|2CO 7:9|Now I rejoice, not because you were made sorrowful, but because your sorrow led to repentance. For you were grieved in a way that was pleasing to God, so that you suffered no loss from us.|This verse emphasizes the distinction between sorrow that leads to repentance and sorrow that does not. Paul expresses joy not because the Corinthians were made sorrowful, but because their sorrow was productive, leading them to genuine repentance.|
|2CO 7:10|For godly grief produces a repentance that leads to salvation without regret, while worldly grief produces death.|This translation captures the essence of Paul's teaching on the nature of godly sorrow versus worldly sorrow. The phrase 'godly grief' denotes a sorrow that leads to true repentance and salvation, contrasting with 'worldly grief' which results in despair and spiritual death. The term 'regret' here is understood in a more profound sense than mere remorse; it indicates a transformative change of heart.|
|2CO 7:11|See how this godly sorrow has produced in you earnestness, an eagerness to clear yourselves, indignation, fear, longing, zeal, and vengeance! In every way you have demonstrated yourselves to be innocent in this matter.|This verse highlights the transformation that occurs in the hearts of believers when they experience godly sorrow. The various terms listed illustrate the intense emotions and actions that arise from such a deep conviction. Each term signifies a different aspect of the response to sin and a commitment to righteousness, culminating in the call for purity in action and intent.|
|2CO 7:12|So even if I wrote to you, it was not because of the one who did wrong, nor because of the one who was wronged, but to make evident your earnestness for us before God.|In this verse, Paul clarifies that his writing was not in response to a particular wrongdoing but to reveal the earnestness of the Corinthians. The terms for 'wrongdoer' and 'wronged' emphasize the absence of personal grievance, focusing instead on the positive outcome of their response to the previous exhortation. The phrase 'before God' suggests the gravity and sincerity of their intentions.|
|2CO 7:13|Therefore we were comforted. And in addition to our comfort, we rejoiced even more at the joy of Titus, because his spirit has been refreshed by all of you.|In this verse, the concept of encouragement (παρακλήσει) and joy (χαρᾷ) is key to understanding the emotional bond between Paul and the Corinthians. The term 'paraklēsis' relates to comfort and encouragement, which is echoed throughout Paul's letters. The translation seeks to reflect both the emotional connection and the relief expressed in the original text.|
|2CO 7:14|For if I have boasted to him about you in any way, I was not put to shame; but just as everything we said to you was true, so also our boasting before Titus has proven to be true.|This verse emphasizes Paul's pride and confidence in the Corinthian believers and in Titus' report of their condition, framing it in the context of truth and sincerity in their relationships. The Greek word "καύχησις" (boasting) is used to reflect a sense of joy and pride grounded in genuine faith and behavior.|
|2CO 7:15|And his affections for you are even greater, as he remembers the obedience of you all, how you received him with fear and trembling.|This verse emphasizes the deep affection and emotional connection Titus has for the Corinthians, highlighting the joy he feels upon recalling their obedience and willingness to receive him with respect. The use of the word 'spleen' (σπλάγχνα) metaphorically represents compassion or deep emotional response, consistent in other scriptural contexts.|
|2CO 7:16|I rejoice because I have complete confidence in you.|This verse emphasizes the apostle Paul's joy in the confidence he has in the Corinthian church. The phrase 'I rejoice' reflects a deep sense of happiness tied to their behavior and faithfulness.
