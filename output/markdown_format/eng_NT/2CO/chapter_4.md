| Reference | Verse | Translation Notes |
|:---------:|-------|-------------------|
|2CO 4:1|Therefore, having this ministry as we have received mercy, we do not lose heart.|The term 'διακονίαν' is translated as 'ministry' here, emphasizing the service aspect of the role of believers. The phrase 'καθὼς ἠλεήθημεν' highlights the mercy that motivates the ministry, suggesting that our actions should not come from a place of despair or discouragement. 'Οὐκ ἐκκακοῦμεν' indicates the need for perseverance in the face of challenges.|
|2CO 4:2|But we have renounced the hidden things of shame, not walking in craftiness nor handling the word of God deceitfully, but by the manifestation of the truth, we commend ourselves to every man's conscience in the sight of God.|This verse emphasizes the integrity of the ministerial approach, avoiding deceit and presenting the truth transparently before God and mankind. The phrase 'the hidden things of shame' reflects the idea of avoiding any behavior that could lead to disgrace, while 'manifestation of the truth' underlines the commitment to honesty and sincerity in one's conduct and teachings.|
|2CO 4:3|But if our gospel is veiled, it is veiled to those who are perishing.|In this verse, Paul addresses the obscured nature of the gospel to those who are lost. The use of 'kept hidden' signifies a spiritual blindness that prevents understanding. This aligns with the concept found in other scriptures regarding veils over hearts and minds that hinder acceptance of the truth.|
|2CO 4:4|In them, the god of this age has blinded the minds of the unbelievers so that they cannot see the light of the gospel of the glory of Christ, who is the image of God.|This verse speaks to the spiritual blindness imposed by the god of this age, preventing the unfaithful from recognizing the true light of the gospel of Christ, who is the image of God. The translation captures the essence of blindness and the theme of illumination associated with the gospel.|
|2CO 4:5|For we do not proclaim ourselves, but Jesus Christ as Lord; and ourselves as your servants for Jesus’ sake.|This verse emphasizes the distinction between the preacher and the message of Christ. Paul clarifies that he and his fellow workers do not proclaim themselves but serve the purpose of spreading the Gospel of Jesus Christ. The term 'Lord' (Κύριον) indicates the authority of Christ, while the acknowledgment of being 'servants' highlights the humility and purpose of their ministry.|
|2CO 4:6|For God, who said, 'Let light shine out of darkness,' has shone in our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ.|In this verse, Paul emphasizes God's transformative power, likening it to the original creation of light from darkness. The 'light' metaphor is deeply rooted in biblical theology, representing knowledge, glory, and divine revelation, especially through Christ.|
|2CO 4:7|But we have this treasure in clay jars, so that the surpassing power belongs to God and not to us.|The phrase 'treasure in jars of clay' symbolizes the contrast between the divine power of God and the fragility of human vessels. It highlights how God's strength is magnified in our weakness, reinforcing the theme of humility and reliance on divine aid.|
|2CO 4:8|We are afflicted in every way, but not crushed; perplexed, but not driven to despair.|This translation aims to convey the emotional tension found in the original Greek, reflecting the duality of experiencing trouble yet not being overwhelmed. The phrase 'in every way' implies a comprehensive experience of trials, while 'not crushed' emphasizes resilience. The construction draws attention to the dichotomy of despair and hope, fitting the context of suffering yet relying on God's power.|
|2CO 4:9|Persecuted, but not forsaken; struck down, but not destroyed.|The original Greek uses the terms 'διωκόμενοι' (being persecuted) and 'καταβαλλόμενοι' (being struck down), emphasizing the ongoing nature of suffering while affirming resilience. The translation maintains this contrast, emphasizing that though one faces persecution and hardship, there is an enduring hope and strength found in faith.|
|2CO 4:10|Always carrying in our bodies the death of the Lord Jesus, so that the life of Jesus may also be revealed in our bodies.|This verse emphasizes the paradox of suffering in Christian life, portraying the ongoing mortality of believers while simultaneously highlighting the revealing of Christ’s life within them. It reflects the theological tension between suffering and resurrection.|
|2CO 4:11|For we who live are always being given over to death for Jesus' sake, so that the life of Jesus may be made manifest in our mortal bodies.|This verse highlights the paradox of the Christian life, where believers are continually offered up to death for the sake of Christ, yet this very sacrifice reveals the life of Jesus through them. The use of 'living' and 'death' juxtaposes the physical existence with the spiritual reality, emphasizing the transformative power of Christ's life within believers, even amidst suffering.|
|2CO 4:12|So death is at work in us, but life is at work in you.|The verse draws a stark contrast between the experiences of believers and the life they possess in Christ, highlighting the duality of suffering and life that coexist in the Christian experience. The phrase 'death works in us' indicates the suffering and trials faced, while 'life in you' emphasizes the transformative power of the Gospel in the lives of others.|
|2CO 4:13|And since we have the same spirit of faith as described in Scripture, 'I believed, therefore I spoke,' we also believe, and therefore we speak.|This verse draws from Psalm 116:10, emphasizing the connection between belief and proclamation. The spirit of faith is understood as a unifying belief that motivates action and speech, mirroring the Apostle Paul's mission to proclaim the gospel boldly.|
|2CO 4:14|Knowing that He who raised the Lord Jesus will also raise us with Jesus and present us with you.|In this verse, Paul emphasizes the assurance of resurrection for believers through the same power that raised Jesus. The use of the term 'raise' signifies not only physical resurrection but also a future hope for believers in Christ. This is a comforting doctrine that connects believers to Christ’s victory over death.|
|2CO 4:15|For all things are for your sake, so that as grace extends to more and more people, it may increase thanksgiving to the glory of God.|In this verse, Paul emphasizes that all things happen for the benefit of the believers, leading to an abundance of grace that results in overflowing thanksgiving to God. This highlights the reciprocal relationship between grace and gratitude among believers, reinforcing the communal aspect of faith and worship.|
|2CO 4:16|Therefore, we do not lose heart. Though our outer self is wasting away, our inner self is being renewed day by day.|The term 'inner self' refers to the spiritual renewal that believers experience through their relationship with Christ. This inner transformation contrasts with the physical decline that is part of human existence. The use of 'day by day' emphasizes the continuous nature of this renewal process, which is a daily experience for the believer.|
|2CO 4:17|For this light and momentary affliction is preparing for us an eternal weight of glory beyond all comparison.|In this translation, the phrase 'light momentary affliction' reflects the temporary nature of trials faced by believers. The term 'eternal weight of glory' emphasizes the lasting and significant glory that is prepared for them. The use of 'producing' illustrates an active process, signifying that trials lead to a greater glory.|
|2CO 4:18|So we do not fix our gaze on the things that are seen, but on the things that are unseen; for the things that are seen are temporary, but the things that are unseen are eternal.|In this translation, the focus is on contrasting the visible and the invisible, emphasizing the eternal perspective over the temporary realities of life. The Greek words for 'seeing' and 'unseen' are key in conveying this duality of perception in faith.|
