| Reference | Verse | Translation Notes |
|:---------:|-------|-------------------|
|2CO 11:1|Oh, that you would bear with me in a little foolishness! Indeed, you are bearing with me!|The verse reflects the Apostle Paul's frustration with the Corinthian church and expresses a desire for them to endure his less-than-flattering behavior. The term 'ἀφροσύνῃ' is interpreted here as 'folly' or 'foolishness', highlighting the contrast between his motives and those who mislead the congregation.|
|2CO 11:2|For I am jealous for you with a godly jealousy; for I have betrothed you to one husband, to present you as a pure virgin to Christ.|In this verse, Paul expresses his intense zeal for the Corinthian church, indicating a desire to present them as pure and devoted to Christ. The word 'zeal' conveys a passionate commitment, reflecting the Old Testament sense of God's zeal for His people. The imagery of presenting the church as a pure virgin suggests an expectation of fidelity and holiness in their relationship with Christ.|
|2CO 11:3|But I fear that, just as the serpent deceived Eve by his cunning, your minds may be led astray from the simplicity and purity that is in Christ.|In this verse, the imagery of the serpent deceiving Eve is crucial for understanding the warning against losing purity in thought. The term 'simplicity' reflects the innocence and devotion intended towards Christ, and it contrasts with the deception being described. This fresh translation aims to capture the essence of the Apostle Paul's concern over the purity of the believers' thoughts regarding their relationship with Christ.|
|2CO 11:4|For if someone comes and preaches another Jesus whom we have not preached, or if you receive a different spirit which you have not received, or a different gospel which you have not accepted, you bear with it well.|In this verse, the Apostle Paul expresses his concern that the Corinthian believers may be swayed by false teachings about Christ, presenting them with alternatives to the authentic Gospel. The emphasis is on the dangers of accepting a distorted view of Jesus, a different spirit, or an alternate message, which leads to confusion and error in faith.|
|2CO 11:5|For I consider that I am not in the least inferior to those super-apostles.|In this verse, Paul is asserting his equal standing among the apostles, emphasizing that he lacks nothing compared to the so-called 'super-apostles.' The term 'super-apostles' indicates those who falsely elevate themselves or their authority. The phrase 'have not been lacking' underscores Paul's confidence in his ministry and its legitimacy in contrast to others who may claim superiority.|
|2CO 11:6|But even if I am unskilled in speaking, I am not in knowledge; rather, we have been made evident in every way to you in all things.|The term 'ἰδιώτης' can imply someone who is untrained or not well-versed in rhetoric, while 'λόγος' refers to speech or discourse. The verse emphasizes that the speaker's ability may not be impressive in terms of rhetoric, but they are fully transparent in their knowledge and intentions towards the recipients, aligning with the themes of authenticity and spiritual integrity found throughout Paul's letters.|
|2CO 11:7|Or did I commit a sin by humbling myself so that you might be exalted, because I preached the Gospel of God to you without charge?|In this verse, Paul expresses the idea that he has humbled himself by not demanding compensation for preaching the Gospel. The notion of self-humbling for the benefit of others is a key theme in the New Testament, especially regarding the message of grace and the example of Christ.|
|2CO 11:8|I robbed other churches by receiving support for my ministry while serving you, and when I was with you and needed, I did not burden anyone.|In this verse, Paul is expressing his practice of accepting support from other congregations while serving the Corinthian church. The language highlights a contrast between his reliance on others for his ministry versus the Corinthians' reception of his message without financial burden. The phrase 'ὀψώνιον' specifically denotes a wage or payment for services rendered, suggesting a formal arrangement of support for the ministry.|
|2CO 11:9|And when the brothers from Macedonia arrived, they fully supplied my needs; and in every way, I kept myself from being a burden to you, and I will continue to do so.|This verse highlights Paul's self-sufficiency and commitment to not being a burden to the Corinthians, while also acknowledging the support he received from the Macedonian churches.|
|2CO 11:10|As surely as the truth of Christ is in me, this boast of mine will not be silenced in the regions of Achaia.|The verse highlights Paul's conviction and the undeniable truth of Christ within him. The focus is on the unwavering authenticity of his boast, which he claims will not be silenced, particularly in the context of the church in Achaia. This reflects the themes of truth and integrity central to Paul's ministry.|
|2CO 11:11|Why? Because I do not love you? God knows!|In this verse, the speaker expresses a concern over their love for the recipients. The Greek word 'ἀγαπῶ' indicates a deep, sacrificial love, while the phrase 'ὁ Θεὸς οἶδεν' emphasizes God's omniscience regarding the speaker's intentions and feelings.|
|2CO 11:12|But what I am doing, I will continue to do, in order to cut off the opportunity from those who desire an opportunity, so that in the matter for which they boast, they may be found just as we are.|In this verse, Paul emphasizes his actions as deliberate and strategic, aiming to remove any basis for those who might take advantage of the situation to boast against him. The term 'ἀφορμή' (opportunity or ground) is central to understanding his motive for doing what he does.|
|2CO 11:13|For such men are false apostles, deceitful workers, disguising themselves as apostles of Christ.|In this verse, Paul warns against deceitful workers who disguise themselves as true apostles. The term 'false apostles' signifies those who falsely claim to be sent by Christ, emphasizing the need for discernment in identifying true from false messengers of the Gospel.|
|2CO 11:14|And no wonder, for Satan himself masquerades as an angel of light.|This verse highlights the deceptive nature of Satan, who transforms himself to appear righteous while embodying falsehood. The term 'angel of light' implies a facade of holiness that conceals his true, malevolent character. The translation preserves the original meaning while maintaining clarity for modern readers.|
|2CO 11:15|Therefore, it is no great surprise if his servants also transform themselves into servants of righteousness. Their end will correspond to their deeds.|In this verse, the Apostle Paul warns about false ministers who appear to be righteous but are, in fact, deceitful. The term 'disguise' or 'transform' indicates an intentional misrepresentation. The phrase 'their end will be according to their works' emphasizes the eventual judgment they will face based on their actions.|
|2CO 11:16|Again, I say, let no one think me foolish; but if you do, receive me as a fool, so that I may boast a little.|The phrase "let no one think me foolish" directly references Paul's concern for how he is perceived. The term "fool" (ἄφρονα) emphasizes the need for humility. The structure of the sentence is aimed at showing that even if he must take on a foolish persona for the sake of argument, it is to make a point about boasting in his own weaknesses and experiences.|
|2CO 11:17|What I say, I do not speak as if from the Lord, but as in foolishness, in this confidence of boasting.|In this verse, Paul indicates that his boasting is not done in the spirit of the Lord but rather in a foolish manner, emphasizing the absurdity of his position to highlight the folly of those who are boasting inappropriately. The term 'καυχήσεως' (boasting) ties back to the context of false apostles and self-promotion that Paul is addressing in his letters.|
|2CO 11:18|Since many boast according to the flesh, I too will boast.|This verse reflects Paul's frustration with the boasting found among some individuals in the church, particularly those who are proud of their fleshly accomplishments. Paul uses the term 'boasting' to highlight the folly of such pride, which is contrary to the humility taught in Christ. He acknowledges that if others choose to boast in worldly accomplishments, he too can participate in that folly, though he ultimately seeks to emphasize the deeper spiritual truths.|
|2CO 11:19|For you gladly tolerate fools, being wise yourselves.|In this verse, Paul addresses the irony of the Corinthians' acceptance of foolishness under the guise of wisdom. The term 'fools' contrasts with their self-perception as wise, indicating a strong rhetorical technique where he highlights their lack of discernment. The phrase 'bear with' indicates a sense of tolerance towards the folly being presented, which is consistent with Paul's overall tone of correction mixed with irony.|
|2CO 11:20|For you bear with it if someone enslaves you, if someone devours you, if someone takes advantage of you, if someone is arrogant toward you, if someone strikes you in the face.|The verse highlights the absurdity of the Corinthians' tolerance for domineering behavior by false teachers. The Greek terms indicate various forms of exploitation and oppression, which can be contrasted with the freedom believers have in Christ.|
|2CO 11:21|To my shame, I speak as though we were weak. But in whatever anyone dares to boast, I also dare to speak, though it is with foolishness.|In this verse, Paul is using irony and sarcasm to highlight the foolishness of those who boast in their credentials or superiority over others. The terms 'daring' and 'foolishness' convey a sense of disdain towards boasting without true merit.|
|2CO 11:22|Are they Hebrews? So am I. Are they Israelites? So am I. Are they descendants of Abraham? So am I.|In this verse, Paul asserts his Jewish identity and lineage, using the phrase 'Hebrews', 'Israelites', and 'descendants of Abraham' to emphasize his qualifications and connection to the covenantal promises made to the Jewish people. The use of these terms underscores his heritage and legitimacy in a discussion that involves boasting about one’s background.|
|2CO 11:23|Are they servants of Christ? I am speaking as a madman—I am a better one; with far more labors, far more imprisonments, countless beatings, and often near death.|This verse highlights the intense hardships faced by Paul as a servant of Christ, emphasizing his relentless commitment and the extreme trials he endured. The choice of words such as 'abundant' and 'frequent' conveys not only the frequency but also the intensity of his experiences, distinguishing his ministry and the suffering that accompanies it.|
|2CO 11:24|Five times I received from the Jews the forty lashes minus one.|The phrase 'by Jews' emphasizes the origin of the suffering, while 'forty stripes save one' reflects a practice of punishment where 39 lashes were given as a means of scourging. This indicates a systematic and severe approach to punishment, typically reserved for serious offenders. The translation maintains a focus on the physical and emotional toll that such experiences bring.|
|2CO 11:25|Three times I was beaten with rods, once I was stoned, three times I suffered shipwreck; a night and a day I spent adrift at sea.|This verse conveys the severity of the apostle Paul's sufferings as part of his ministry. The original Greek terms emphasize the physical nature of the afflictions he endured, such as being beaten, stoned, and shipwrecked, highlighting the relentless challenges he faced.|
|2CO 11:26|I have been in journeys often, in dangers from rivers, in dangers from robbers, in dangers from my own countrymen, in dangers from the Gentiles, in dangers in the city, in dangers in the wilderness, in dangers at sea, and in dangers among false brethren.|In this verse, Paul lists various dangers he faced during his travels. The term 'danger' (κινδύνοις) appears multiple times, emphasizing the risks involved in his ministry work. 'Journeys' (ὁδοιπορίαις) reflects the numerous travels he undertook, which were often perilous. The structure of the sentence conveys a sense of accumulation and severity of experiences, culminating in the concept of false brothers (ψευδαδέλφοις) who posed spiritual dangers as well.|
|2CO 11:27|In toil and hardship, in sleeplessness often, in hunger and thirst, in fasting often, in cold and nakedness;.|This verse describes the intense hardships faced by the Apostle Paul in his ministry, emphasizing both physical and spiritual struggles. The choice of words highlights not only the labor and exhaustion but also the vulnerabilities endured through fasting and exposure. The translation aims to reflect the gravity and depth of his experiences, remaining faithful to the original Greek.|
|2CO 11:28|Besides the external trials, my daily burden is the care I feel for all the churches.|The phrase "my daily concern for all the churches" emphasizes the Apostle Paul's deep care and responsibility for the spiritual well-being of the early Christian communities. The word 'concern' indicates a profound level of emotional and spiritual investment rather than mere obligation. In this context, it reflects both his commitment and the challenges of pastoral leadership.|
|2CO 11:29|Who is weak, and I am not weak? Who is made to stumble, and I do not burn with indignation?|This verse expresses the deep emotional connection and empathy that Paul feels towards the struggles of others, highlighting his identification with their weaknesses and challenges. The choice of words such as 'weakness' and 'burn' suggests a personal investment and shared suffering, central themes in Paul's letters that emphasize community and mutual care among believers.|
|2CO 11:30|If I must boast, I will boast of the things that show my weakness.|In this verse, Paul expresses a profound theological insight that contrasts worldly boasting with spiritual humility. The use of 'weakness' (ἀσθενείας) indicates a theme throughout 2 Corinthians where strength is found in vulnerability, a recurrent idea in Paul's letters. The word 'boast' (καυχήσομαι) emphasizes pride in one's weakness as a testimony to Christ's strength. This is a distinct call to shift the understanding of weakness from a liability to a point of strength in faith.|
|2CO 11:31|The God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who is blessed forever, knows that I am not lying.|In this verse, Paul emphasizes the certainty of his words by invoking God, whom he calls the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ. The phrase 'who is blessed forever' indicates God’s eternal nature and serves to affirm the truthfulness of Paul’s claim that he is not lying about his experiences and sufferings.|
|2CO 11:32|In Damascus, the governor Aretas, appointed by the king, was guarding the city of the Damascenes, wanting to seize me.|In this verse, the mention of the governor of Damascus refers to a specific historical figure, Aretas, who was involved in the governance of the region during the time of Paul's ministry. The phrase 'seeking to capture me' indicates the urgency and danger of the situation faced by Paul.|
|2CO 11:33|And I was let down through a window in a basket, slipping through the wall, thus I escaped his hands.|The translation of 2 Corinthians 11:33 draws from the imagery of escape and surveillance.
