| Reference | Verse | Translation Notes |
|:---------:|-------|-------------------|
|2CO 3:1|Are we beginning to commend ourselves again? Or do we need, like some, letters of recommendation to you or from you?|The verse emphasizes the validity of apostolic ministry without the need for external letters of commendation, as the transformed lives of the recipients stand as the true testimony.|
|2CO 3:2|You yourselves are our letter, inscribed in our hearts, known and read by all people.|In this verse, Paul emphasizes the authenticity and nature of his apostolic ministry, indicating that the believers themselves serve as his letter of commendation. The term 'written in our hearts' signifies an internalized knowledge of faith rather than external credentials, underscoring the transformative work of the Spirit in their lives. The contrast to written letters highlights the deeper, spiritual connection he shares with the Corinthians.|
|2CO 3:3|You show that you are a letter from Christ, delivered by us, inscribed not with ink, but with the Spirit of the living God; not on tablets of stone, but on tablets of human hearts.|This verse emphasizes the transformative work of Christ through the Holy Spirit, highlighting the contrast between written law and the inner transformation that occurs in believers. The mention of 'hearts' signifies the internalization of God's will and presence, indicating that true change is not merely external but deeply rooted within the believer's life.|
|2CO 3:4|Such confidence we have through Christ toward God.|In this verse, the Apostle Paul emphasizes the confidence that believers have through their relationship with Christ, connecting it to their standing before God. The original Greek word 'Πεποίθησιν' (confidence) carries a sense of trust and assurance, which is key in understanding our position as believers. The phrase 'διὰ τοῦ Χριστοῦ' (through Christ) is crucial, as it indicates that this confidence is not derived from ourselves but is rooted in our faith in Jesus.|
|2CO 3:5|Not that we are sufficient in ourselves to claim anything as coming from us, but our sufficiency is from God.|In this verse, the emphasis is on the source of our adequacy, which is not from ourselves but from God. The word 'adequacy' (ἱκανότης) is interpreted here as our capacity to fulfill God's calling, which is inherently rooted in divine enablement rather than human self-sufficiency.|
|2CO 3:6|He has made us sufficient as ministers of a new covenant, not of the letter, but of the Spirit; for the letter kills, but the Spirit gives life.|In this translation, I've focused on conveying the contrast between the old covenant characterized by the letter of the law, and the new covenant characterized by the life-giving Spirit. The original Greek terms have been translated to reflect their meaning clearly, emphasizing the role of the Spirit in the new covenant.|
|2CO 3:7|But if the ministry that brought death, engraved in letters on stones, came with such glory that the children of Israel could not gaze steadily at the face of Moses because of the glory that was fading away,|This verse refers to the ministry of the old covenant characterized by the law, which is seen as glorious but ultimately transient. It illustrates how the glory of Moses' face reflected the divine presence but faded over time, contrasting it with the enduring glory of the new covenant established through Christ.|
|2CO 3:8|How much more glorious will the ministry of the Spirit be?|This verse highlights the contrast between the ministry of the Spirit and the ministry of the Law. The use of the word 'glory' emphasizes the overwhelming presence and work of the Holy Spirit compared to the fading glory of the old covenant. The rhetorical question implies a clear affirmation of the superior glory associated with the Spirit's ministry.|
|2CO 3:9|For if the ministry that brought condemnation was glorious, how much more glorious is the ministry that brings righteousness!|This verse highlights the comparison between the ministry associated with condemnation and the ministry associated with righteousness. The emphasis is on the greater glory that accompanies the ministry of righteousness compared to that of condemnation. The terms 'ministry of condemnation' and 'ministry of righteousness' are pivotal, reflecting on the contrasting nature of the old and new covenants, and the surpassing glory of the new covenant established through Christ.|
|2CO 3:10|Indeed, the glory that was once splendid is no longer regarded as such because of the surpassing glory that has come.|The phrase 'the glory that has been made glorious' refers to the diminishing nature of the old covenant in light of the surpassing glory of the new covenant in Christ. The use of 'this part' emphasizes the comparative nature of the two glories.|
|2CO 3:11|For if what was being brought to an end came with glory, much more will what is permanent be filled with glory.|This verse emphasizes the contrast between the temporary nature of the Old Covenant and the enduring glory of the New Covenant. The phrase 'much more' indicates a significant enhancement in glory that the New Covenant provides.|
|2CO 3:12|Having such a hope, we use great boldness in our speech.|In this verse, the term 'parrhesia' refers to boldness or confidence in speech and action, rooted in the hope provided by faith. This underscores the believer's assurance before God, given the context of the transformative glory of the new covenant compared to the old.|
|2CO 3:13|And we are not like Moses, who put a veil over his face so that the children of Israel would not gaze at the end of what was passing away.|The translation conveys the idea that Moses used a veil to prevent the Israelites from seeing the fading glory of his face. This act symbolizes the obscured understanding of the people regarding the fading covenant. The use of 'veil' here represents a spiritual barrier to comprehending the fullness of God's revelation.|
|2CO 3:14|But their minds were hardened; for to this day the same veil remains unlifted when they read the old covenant, because it is only in Christ that it is taken away.|This verse speaks to the spiritual blindness of the Israelites in relation to the old covenant and highlights that this veil remains unlifted, preventing them from understanding that it is in Christ where the old covenant is rendered obsolete. The use of 'veil' symbolizes their inability to perceive the truth revealed in the New Covenant.|
|2CO 3:15|But to this day, whenever Moses is read, a veil lies over their hearts.|The verse illustrates the spiritual blindness that persists in Israel regarding the understanding of the Old Covenant when Moses is read, suggesting that a veil covers their hearts. This metaphor of a veil emphasizes the separation from the truth that is only revealed through Christ. The translation seeks to maintain the original's nuances and the imagery of the heart's condition in relation to understanding God's revelation.|
|2CO 3:16|But whenever one turns to the Lord, the veil is taken away.|The phrase 'whenever he turns to the Lord' indicates a moment of spiritual awakening or repentance, reflecting the transformational encounter with God that removes the veil of misunderstanding and hard-heartedness. The term 'veil' represents the spiritual blindness that obstructs understanding of God's truth, and its removal signifies the liberation and clarity granted through Christ.|
|2CO 3:17|Now, the Lord is the Spirit, and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom.|In this verse, Paul emphasizes the connection between the Lord and the Holy Spirit, highlighting that true freedom is found in the presence of the Spirit. The word 'freedom' suggests liberation from constraints, particularly those imposed by the Law. This contrasts the life of a believer who walks in the Spirit with one under the Old Covenant, indicating that the presence of the Spirit brings a transformative liberty.|
|2CO 3:18|But we all, with unveiled faces, reflecting the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image from glory to glory, just as by the Spirit of the Lord.|In this verse, the theme of transformation and reflection of the Lord’s glory is central. The use of 'beholding' and 'transforming' indicates an active process of becoming more like Christ, enhanced by the mention of the Spirit’s work. I chose 'unveiled face' to capture the contrast with previous verses regarding the law and the veil over Moses’ face, while 'the same image' conveys the likeness to Christ in a relational context rather than mere appearance.|
