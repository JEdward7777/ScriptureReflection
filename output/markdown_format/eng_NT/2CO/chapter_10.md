| Reference | Verse | Translation Notes |
|:---------:|-------|-------------------|
|2CO 10:1|Now I, Paul, appeal to you by the gentleness and humility of Christ, who is meek in presence among you, but bold toward you when absent.|This verse reflects the apostle Paul's appeal to the Corinthians based on the character of Christ, emphasizing qualities of gentleness and humility. The Greek words used here for 'gentleness' (πρᾳότης) and 'humility' (ταπεινός) capture the essence of Christ’s demeanor and serve as a model for the community.|
|2CO 10:2|But I ask that when I am present, I may not have to be bold with that confidence by which I intend to challenge some who think of us as if we walked according to the flesh.|In this verse, Paul expresses his desire to approach the Corinthians with a certain attitude, emphasizing the difference between physical presence and the confidence rooted in faith. The terms 'boldness' and 'flesh' play a critical role in understanding his argument against those who misjudge his authority and manner based on mere outward appearances.|
|2CO 10:3|For though we walk in the flesh, we do not wage war according to the flesh.|In this verse, 'walking in the flesh' refers to living in accordance with human desires and physical impulses, while 'waging war according to the flesh' indicates that the apostle Paul emphasizes that his spiritual warfare does not rely on worldly methods or standards.|
|2CO 10:4|For the weapons of our warfare are not of the flesh, but are mighty through God for the pulling down of strongholds.|This verse emphasizes the nature of spiritual warfare, contrasting it with physical battles and highlighting that our tools are divinely empowered rather than merely human in origin.|
|2CO 10:5|We destroy arguments and every lofty opinion raised against the knowledge of God, and take every thought captive to obey Christ.|This translation seeks to convey the meaning of the original Greek text while maintaining clarity and relevance to contemporary readers. The terms 'thoughts' and 'arguments' have been chosen to capture the nuances of 'λογισμοὺς' and 'ὕψωμα', respectively, emphasizing the intellectual and spiritual battle against prideful or rebellious ideas.|
|2CO 10:6|And we are ready to punish every act of disobedience, once your obedience is complete.|This verse highlights the readiness to punish disobedience once obedience is fully established. The Greek term for 'punish' implies a sense of justice and consequence for rebellion, echoing the importance of obedience in a believer's life.|
|2CO 10:7|You are looking at outward appearances! If anyone is confident that he belongs to Christ, let him consider again that just as he is Christ's, so too are we.|In this verse, Paul addresses the issue of self-assessment among believers, particularly in the context of their relationship to Christ. The phrase 'if anyone thinks he is Christ’s' underscores the importance of understanding one's identity in Christ without pride or falsehood. The translation captures the nuances of self-perception and communal identity within the Christian faith.|
|2CO 10:8|For even if I boast somewhat abundantly about our authority, which the Lord gave us for building you up and not for tearing you down, I will not be ashamed.|In this verse, Paul defends his authority given by God, emphasizing that it is meant for building up the church rather than tearing it down. The key themes of authority, construction (edification), and not causing shame are reflected throughout the verse, as Paul seeks to clarify his intentions with the Corinthians.|
|2CO 10:9|I do not want it to seem as though I am trying to frighten you through my letters.|This translation emphasizes Paul's intent not to intimidate or cause fear through his letters, maintaining the tone of authority balanced with pastoral concern. The word choice reflects the nuance of both confidence and pastoral responsibility.|
|2CO 10:10|For it is said, 'His letters are weighty and powerful, but his physical presence is weak, and his speech is of no account.'|In this verse, the apostle Paul contrasts the perceived strength of his letters with the weakness of his physical presence and speech. The terms 'letters' and 'presence' suggest a juxtaposition between written communication and physical manifestation. The word 'strong' refers to the authoritative tone of the letters, while 'weak' indicates his humble demeanor when present. This contrast underscores the potential misinterpretation of authority based solely on appearances.|
|2CO 10:11|Let such a one consider this: that just as we are in word through letters when absent, so also we will be in action when present.|In this verse, the apostle Paul is emphasizing the importance of how one is perceived based on their actions and communication, rather than mere physical presence. The term 'λογίζεσθω' conveys a call to reason or consider, and 'τοιοῦτος' reflects the specific type of person being addressed, in this case, critics of his apostolic authority. The phrase 'τοῖς λόγοις' connects to how one communicates their thoughts through letters, which were a common means of conveying messages in Paul's time. This translation strives to maintain the essence of the original Greek while being clear and direct for modern readers.|
|2CO 10:12|For we do not dare to classify or compare ourselves with some who commend themselves; but when they measure themselves by themselves and compare themselves with themselves, they do not understand.|This verse emphasizes the futility of comparing oneself with others, highlighting a theme of self-awareness and humility that runs throughout Paul's letters. The Greek terms used convey a sense of arrogance associated with self-comparison, which Paul discourages among believers.|
|2CO 10:13|But we will not boast beyond our proper limit, but will keep our boast within the sphere of influence that God has assigned to us, a sphere that includes you.|In this verse, Paul emphasizes the importance of measuring one's achievements and boasting according to God's given standards rather than human standards. The word 'measure' here implies a divine boundary or standard that should govern one's self-assessment. This reflects the idea that one's ministry or influence is determined by God's allocation, promoting humility and reliance on God's direction.|
|2CO 10:14|For we are not overreaching in our boasting, as though we were not reaching you; for we were the first to come all the way to you with the gospel of Christ.|In this verse, Paul emphasizes the genuine reach of his ministry and the established relationship with the recipients of the letter. The term 'boast' conveys confidence in the work done through the Gospel, while 'to you' indicates the community's significance in this mission. The phrase suggests the authentic spread of the Gospel rather than overstepping bounds.|
|2CO 10:15|We do not boast beyond measure in the labors of others, but we have hope that as your faith grows, we will be greatly honored among you, according to our measure, in abundance.|This verse emphasizes the theme of spiritual growth and the legitimate boast one can have based on the increase of faith in the community. The context here is important as it contrasts false boasting with genuine hope that arises from the faith of others, leading to glorification in accordance with established measures.|
|2CO 10:16|to proclaim the gospel in regions beyond you, not to boast in another's sphere of achievement.|The phrase 'εἰς τὰ ὑπερέκεινα' suggests an intention or a mission that goes beyond the current scope of activity. The expression 'οὐκ ἐν ἀλλοτρίῳ κανόνι' emphasizes the importance of maintaining one's own standards and not measuring oneself against the work of others, reflecting a sense of integrity and purpose in ministry.|
|2CO 10:17|But let the one who boasts boast in the Lord.|The focus of this verse emphasizes boasting not in one's own accomplishments but in the Lord. The use of 'boasting' here aligns with the Old Testament understanding of putting trust in God and recognizing His supremacy in all matters.|
|2CO 10:18|For it is not the one who commends himself who is approved, but the one whom the Lord commends.|This verse emphasizes that true validation and worthiness come not from self-commendation, but from God's recognition and endorsement. It reflects a key principle in Christian humility and reliance on God’s approval over human judgment.|
