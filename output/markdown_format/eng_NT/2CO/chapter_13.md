| Reference | Verse | Translation Notes |
|:---------:|-------|-------------------|
|2CO 13:1|This is the third time I am coming to you. Every charge must be established by the testimony of two or three witnesses.|The original Greek uses the phrase "upon the testimony of two or three witnesses" which reflects the Jewish legal principle emphasizing the need for corroborating testimony. This principle is also echoed throughout Scripture, as seen in the related verses, reinforcing the importance of credible witnesses in matters of judgment.|
|2CO 13:2|I have previously stated and now repeat, as I was present the second time, and now write to those who have sinned previously and to all the rest, that if I come again, I will not spare anyone.|This verse emphasizes Paul's authority and seriousness regarding his previous statements about discipline and judgment within the church. The repetition of the phrase 'the second time' indicates an ongoing issue that necessitates firm action. The phrase 'I will not spare' suggests a warning of strictness if the issues are not addressed before his arrival.|
|2CO 13:3|Since you seek a demonstration of Christ speaking in me, He who is not weak toward you, but powerful among you.|In this verse, Paul is emphasizing the authority of Christ that works through him, highlighting the strength and efficacy of Christ's presence among the believers. The phrase 'testing the proof of Christ speaking in me' indicates a call to recognize the genuine authority and power that is present, not to be confused with weakness.|
|2CO 13:4|For though He was crucified in weakness, yet He lives by the power of God; for we also are weak in Him, but we will live with Him by the power of God toward you.|This verse contrasts the weakness experienced in Christ’s death with the power that comes through His resurrection, emphasizing the strength believers have through their connection with Christ and God's power.|
|2CO 13:5|Examine yourselves to see whether you are in the faith; test yourselves. Do you not realize that Jesus Christ is in you? Unless, indeed, you fail the test.|In this verse, Paul emphasizes self-examination and the importance of recognizing Christ's presence within the believer. The phrase 'examine yourselves' indicates an introspective look into one's faith and relationship with Christ, urging the readers to verify their spiritual standing. The term 'reprobate' implies a sense of being unapproved or disqualified, serving as a solemn reminder to maintain a genuine faith.|
|2CO 13:6|But I hope you will recognize that we are not disqualified.|In this verse, the apostle Paul expresses his hope that the Corinthians will recognize the authenticity of his ministry and their faith. The term 'ἀδόκιμοι' implies a sense of being disqualified or rejected, contrasting the idea of being tested and approved. This translation aims to capture the essence of Paul's expectation for the Corinthians to acknowledge their standing in faith, similar to the context of testing oneself from the previous verse.|
|2CO 13:7|Now I pray to God that you do no wrong, not so that we may appear approved, but that you may do what is good, even if we may be regarded as unapproved.|In this verse, Paul expresses his desire for the Corinthians to act rightly rather than as a means to vindicate himself. The contrast between doing good and being seen as unworthy is emphasized. The translation aims to maintain the intention of Paul’s appeal while capturing the nuances of his concern for their spiritual integrity.|
|2CO 13:8|For we cannot do anything against the truth, but only for the truth.|The phrase 'against the truth' signifies any actions that contradict or oppose the truth of God's word. The phrase 'for the truth' indicates a stance of support and advocacy for God's truth, rather than opposition. This translation emphasizes the believer's relationship with truth as rooted in God's character.|
|2CO 13:9|For we rejoice when we are weak and you are strong; and this is what we pray for, your restoration.|This verse expresses the joy found in the strength of others in the faith and the desire for their spiritual growth. The term 'strength' connects with the concept of equipping and building one another up in the Christian community, reflecting a common theme of mutual support and encouragement found throughout the New Testament.|
|2CO 13:10|Therefore, while I am absent, I write these things so that when I come, I may not have to be severe in my use of the authority that the Lord has given me for building up and not for tearing down.|This verse emphasizes the importance of authority given by the Lord and its purpose. The choice of words reflects the intent to build up rather than to tear down, which is consistent with the themes of edification found throughout Paul's letters.|
|2CO 13:11|Finally, brothers and sisters, rejoice! Aim for restoration, encourage one another, be of one mind, live in peace; and the God of love and peace will be with you.|In this translation, I focused on the key exhortations of Paul to the Corinthians. The terms 'be of good cheer', 'be restored', 'be encouraged', and 'think the same' reflect the encouragement and community Paul desires for the church. The term 'God of love and peace' encapsulates the essence of the relationship believers should strive for.|
|2CO 13:12|Greet one another with a holy kiss. All the saints greet you.|The phrase 'holy kiss' emphasizes the importance of affection and unity among believers in Christ. This verse encourages Christians to express love and fellowship as part of their communal life, reflecting the spiritual bond that they share.|
|2CO 13:13|The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all. Amen.|This translation aims to convey the fullness of the blessing conveyed in Paul's closing words, emphasizing the relationship between the elements of grace, love, and fellowship within the Trinity and the believer's community.|
