|2CO 12:1|It is necessary for me to go on boasting, although it is not profitable for me; I will move on to visions and revelations from the Lord.|In this verse, Paul contrasts the act of boasting, which he acknowledges is not beneficial for him, with the divine experiences he has had. The terms 'visions' and 'revelations' refer to spiritual experiences given by the Lord, emphasizing the supernatural nature of his encounters rather than personal pride or boasting.|

|2CO 12:4|that he was caught up into paradise and heard inexpressible words, which it is not lawful for a man to speak.|This verse discusses a profound spiritual experience of being taken into a divine realm, with an emphasis on the inexpressible nature of the communication received there. The term 'paradise' suggests a place of divine presence and joy, akin to the experiences described in other scriptures.|
|2CO 12:5|On behalf of such a one I will boast, but on my own account I will not boast, except of my weaknesses.|In this verse, Paul emphasizes the contrast between boasting about others and his reluctance to boast about himself, particularly in regard to his own weaknesses. The word 'καυχήσομαι' indicates a form of pride or boasting that he carefully qualifies by referencing his 'ἀσθενείαις,' or weaknesses, highlighting a theological principle that strength is found in acknowledging one's frailty.|
|2CO 12:6|For if I wished to boast, I would not be foolish; for I would speak the truth. But I refrain, so that no one may regard me beyond what they see in me or hear from me.|In this verse, Paul reflects on the nature of boasting and truthfulness, emphasizing that he speaks truthfully about himself. The term 'boast' carries the implication of pride, but Paul contrasts this with the idea of not being foolish in boasting, grounding his argument in a spirit of humility. The mention of being judged by others highlights the relational aspect of boasting and self-perception among believers.|
|2CO 12:7|And because of the abundance of the revelations, to keep me from becoming proud, there was given to me a thorn in the flesh, a messenger of Satan to buffet me, lest I be exalted above measure.|In this verse, the term 'scolex' (translated as 'thorn') metaphorically refers to a persistent affliction.

Therefore, I will boast all the more gladly of my weaknesses, so that the power of Christ may rest upon me.|This translation emphasizes the sufficiency of God's grace and the transformative power of weakness, staying true to the original Greek terms. The phrase 'my grace is sufficient for you' is interpreted as a divine assurance, highlighting that God's power is most vividly demonstrated through our weaknesses.|
|2CO 12:10|Therefore, I take pleasure in my weaknesses, in insults, in hardships, in persecutions, and in distresses for Christ's sake; for when I am weak, then I am strong.|This verse emphasizes the paradox of Christian strength: true power is found in acknowledging and embracing our weaknesses and trials. The key words like 'weaknesses' and 'strength' are essential to the understanding of this passage, reflecting the transformative power of Christ in the believer's life.|
|2CO 12:11|I have become a fool in boasting; you have compelled me. For I ought to have been commended by you, since I am not in the least inferior to the most eminent apostles, even though I am nothing.|In this verse, Paul uses strong language to emphasize the folly of boasting, especially in light of the divine calling and the nature of true apostolic authority. The word 'ἄφρων' (foolish) relates closely to the wisdom of God, which often contrasts with human wisdom. The phrase 'ὑμεῖς με ἠναγκάσατε' (you have compelled me) highlights the pressure he feels from the Corinthians to validate his apostleship against those who boast.|

Forgive me this wrong.|This verse addresses Paul's defense regarding his treatment of the Corinthians in comparison to other churches, highlighting his lack of financial burden on them while still serving them.

|2CO 12:14|Look, I am ready to visit you for the third time, and I will not be a burden to you; for what I desire is not your possessions, but you. After all, children should not have to save up for their parents, but parents for their children.|This verse emphasizes the relationship between a spiritual leader and their congregation, focusing on the sacrificial nature of love and service.

|2CO 12:15|And I will gladly spend and be utterly spent for your souls; even if I love you more abundantly, I am loved less.|This verse reflects the deep emotional commitment and sacrificial love that Paul has for the Corinthians, emphasizing the notion of selflessness in service to others.|
|2CO 12:16|But let it be known that I did not burden you, yet being crafty, I took you in by deceit.|In this verse, Paul uses the word 'πανοῦργος' which translates to 'cunning' or 'crafty', indicating a deceptive nature.
