|:---------:|-------|-------------------|
|2CO 9:1|Now, concerning the service to the saints, it is unnecessary for me to write to you.|In this verse, the term 'διακονίας' refers to ministry or service, specifically towards the saints, which Paul emphasizes as a crucial task. The term 'ἁγίους' denotes the holy ones or saints, a significant group that Paul is concerned about, indicating a deep connection and responsibility. This verse introduces the discussion of the collection for the needy saints, reflecting the themes of generosity and support within the early church.|
|2CO 9:2|For I know your readiness, of which I boast about you to the Macedonians, that Achaia has been prepared since last year; and your zeal has stirred up the majority.|In this verse, the Apostle Paul speaks of the readiness and eagerness of the Corinthians to give, which has been a source of pride and inspiration to others, particularly the Macedonians. The word 'zeal' (ἠρέθισεν) captures the passionate response of the Corinthians to the call for generosity. The structure emphasizes both their prior preparation and the effect it has had on other communities.|
|2CO 9:3|But I have sent the brothers, so that our boasting about you may not be in vain in this matter, but that you may be prepared, just as I said you would be.|In this verse, Paul emphasizes the importance of the preparation made by the Corinthians for the collection he is discussing. He expresses concern that the boasting he has done about their readiness should not be in vain, and that they should indeed be ready as promised. The Greek word 'καύχημα' relates to boasting, and 'κενωθῇ' signifies being made empty or without purpose, indicating Paul's desire for their readiness to be fulfilled.|
|2CO 9:4|Otherwise, if the Macedonians come with me and find you unprepared, we—not to mention you—would be humiliated in this undertaking, as we had previously boasted about you.|This verse highlights the importance of being properly prepared for the generosity that is expected among the churches, reflecting the theme of honor and readiness in ministry. The use of terms related to being 'prepared' emphasizes the necessity of diligence and respect in our dealings with others, especially in the context of communal contributions.|
|2CO 9:5|Therefore, I thought it necessary to urge the brothers to go to you in advance and prepare your promised gift, so that it may be ready as a blessing, not as something obtained by greed.|In this verse, the apostle Paul is encouraging the Corinthians to be prepared for their promised contribution. The word 'prepared' carries the sense of being ready and arranged ahead of time. The contrast between 'blessing' and 'greed' emphasizes the spirit of generosity versus selfishness. The term 'blessing' indicates that the act of giving is not just a transaction but a means of expressing love and support within the community.|
|2CO 9:6|But this I say: He who sows sparingly will also reap sparingly, and he who sows generously will also reap generously.|This translation emphasizes the principle of generosity and the correlation between one's giving and receiving. The use of terms such as 'sowing' and 'reaping' is central to the understanding of the verse, as it reflects the agricultural metaphor used in the original Greek.|
|2CO 9:7|Each one must give as he has decided in his heart, not reluctantly or under compulsion, for God loves a cheerful giver.|This translation aims to reflect the emphasis on voluntary giving and the attitude of the giver. The phrase 'as he purposes in his heart' underscores personal intention, while 'not reluctantly or out of compulsion' highlights the spirit in which one should give. The closing phrase connects the heart of God to the character of the giver, illustrating the divine approval of cheerful generosity.|
|2CO 9:8|And God is able to make all grace abound toward you, so that in all things, at all times, having all that you need, you may overflow in every good work.|The essence of this verse speaks to the abundant provision of God, emphasizing His ability to bless us richly so that we can in turn bless others through good works. The original Greek structure is maintained while the words are rendered in a contemporary yet faithful manner.|
|2CO 9:9|As it is written: ‘He has scattered abroad; he has given to the poor; his righteousness endures forever.’|The phrase 'as it is written' introduces a citation from the Scriptures, emphasizing the continuity of God's righteousness through acts of generosity. The original Greek term for 'righteousness' (δικαιοσύνη) denotes not just a moral quality but a divine standard that is eternal and unchanging, highlighting the lasting impact of benevolent actions.|
|2CO 9:10|Now He who supplies seed to the sower and bread for food will supply and multiply your seed for sowing and increase the harvest of your righteousness.|This verse highlights God's provision for both physical and spiritual needs, emphasizing His role in supplying the means to produce both seed for planting and bread for eating. The mention of righteousness connects to the theme of the generous and just character of God, and the increase of the harvest refers to both material and spiritual growth in believers' lives.|
|2CO 9:11|You will be enriched in every way for all generosity, which produces thanksgiving to God through us.|This translation captures the essence of generosity and the resulting thanksgiving that comes from God's blessings. The original Greek word 'πλουτιζόμενοι' emphasizes abundance, while 'ἁπλότητα' refers to simplicity or sincerity in giving. The phrase suggests that the act of giving generously leads to heartfelt gratitude towards God, which is fundamental in Christian teaching.|
|2CO 9:12|For the ministry of this service is not only supplying the needs of the saints, but is also overflowing in many thanksgivings to God.|The original Greek emphasizes the dual purpose of the service being both a means of supplying the needs of the saints and resulting in abundant thanksgivings to God. This fresh translation aims to capture that essence while maintaining clarity and faithfulness to the original.|

|2CO 9:15|Thanks be to God for His indescribable gift!|In this verse, Paul expresses profound gratitude to God for the indescribable gift that comes from His grace. The term 'indescribable' highlights the depth and significance of this gift, which transcends human expression. This verse serves as a concluding remark to the context of generosity and the spiritual blessings that arise from God's grace.|
