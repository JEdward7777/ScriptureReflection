|:---------:|-------|-------------------|
|2CO 5:1|For we know that if our earthly house, this tent, is destroyed, we have a building from God, a house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens.|In this verse, the Apostle Paul contrasts our earthly existence with our eternal home provided by God. The use of the terms 'tent' and 'building' indicates a transition from the temporary to the permanent, highlighting the difference between our mortal life and the eternal life to come.|
|2CO 5:2|For in this earthly existence, we long to be clothed with our heavenly dwelling,|In this verse, the Apostle Paul expresses a deep yearning for a heavenly dwelling. The word 'oiketērion' refers to a permanent residence, contrasting with the temporary nature of our earthly existence. The phrase 'ἐπενδύσασθαι' indicates a desire to be clothed with this heavenly dwelling, emphasizing transformation from mortality to immortality.|
|2CO 5:3|If indeed we are found not naked when we have been clothed.|This verse highlights the hope of not being found naked in the spiritual sense, reflecting the desire for a divine and eternal state, in contrast to a state of spiritual barrenness.|
|2CO 5:4|For indeed, while we are in this earthly tent, we groan, longing to be clothed with our heavenly dwelling, not wanting to be stripped away, but rather to be fully covered, so that mortality may be swallowed up by life.|This verse expresses a deep yearning for the eternal state rather than the temporary existence we endure in our physical bodies. The words 'groan' and 'clothe' resonate with the imagery of longing for what is eternal and true life. The contrast between shedding the mortal body and being clothed with the imperishable emphasizes hope in resurrection.|
|2CO 5:5|Now the One who has prepared us for this very purpose is God, who has given us the Spirit as a deposit guaranteeing what is to come.|This verse emphasizes God's role as the one who prepares us for our eternal existence, assuring us with the Holy Spirit as a pledge. The terms 'to make ready' and 'the Spirit' connect to the overarching themes of hope and assurance found throughout Scripture, especially in the context of our future resurrection and eternal life with God.|
|2CO 5:6|Therefore, we are always confident, knowing that while we are at home in the body, we are away from the Lord.|In this translation, the emphasis is on the confident assurance of believers regarding their existence in the body versus their future with the Lord. The terms 'confidence' and 'know' are key concepts that reflect a deep-seated belief in the Christian hope of eternal life and communion with God.|
|2CO 5:7|For we walk by faith, not by sight.|The phrase 'by faith' emphasizes reliance on God and spiritual truths over physical appearances. The contrast between 'faith' and 'sight' highlights the Christian principle of trusting in God rather than being swayed by worldly perceptions.|
|2CO 5:8|We are confident, yes, well pleased rather to be absent from the body and to be present with the Lord.|The Greek word 'ἐκδημῆσαι' implies a sense of leaving or departing from the earthly body, while 'ἐνδημῆσαι' indicates the desire to dwell with the Lord. The context is the transition from earthly life to heavenly existence, emphasizing the hope and assurance believers have regarding their ultimate fate.|
|2CO 5:9|Therefore, we make it our aim, whether at home or away, to be well-pleasing to Him.|The verse emphasizes the aspiration of believers to live in a manner that is pleasing to God, regardless of their physical circumstances. The term 'φιλοτιμούμεθα' reflects a strong desire or ambition, while 'εὐάρεστοι' suggests a pleasing disposition before God. This passage can be viewed as a reminder of the believer's purpose in life and beyond.|
|2CO 5:10|For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ, so that each one may receive what is due for the things done while in the body, whether good or bad.|In this verse, the Apostle Paul emphasizes the inevitability of standing before Christ's judgment seat. The use of 'must' indicates a necessity, and 'revealed' highlights the transparency of the judgment. Each individual is accountable for their actions, whether good or bad, which ties into the preceding verse about pleasing God.|
|2CO 5:11|Knowing therefore the fear of the Lord, we persuade men; but we are made manifest to God, and I hope that we are also made manifest in your consciences.|In this verse, Paul speaks about the awareness of God's judgment and the necessity of persuading others in light of this truth. The translation seeks to preserve the weight of the original text, emphasizing the dual aspects of reverential fear of the Lord and the desire for authenticity in the believers' conscience.|
|2CO 5:12|For we are not again commending ourselves to you, but are giving you an occasion to boast about us, so that you may have an answer for those who boast in outward appearance and not in heart.|In this verse, Paul emphasizes the importance of authenticity and true character over outward appearances. The contrast between those who boast in appearance versus those who boast in the heart is critical. The term 'commend' in the original context reflects a self-recommendation which Paul intentionally refrains from, choosing instead to direct the attention of the Corinthians to the validity of their witness regarding his ministry.|
|2CO 5:13|For if we are beside ourselves, it is for God; if we are in our right mind, it is for you.|In this verse, the apostle Paul expresses the duality of his experience—whether he appears to be out of his mind or of sound judgment—both in relation to God and in his interactions with others. The term 'out of our minds' (ἐξέστημεν) indicates a state of divine ecstasy or being overwhelmed by the Spirit, while 'sober' (σωφρονοῦμεν) refers to a state of rational and self-controlled thought, particularly in communicating with others. This duality captures the essence of a faithful life where one may appear eccentric due to divine influence but is also anchored in self-discipline.|
|2CO 5:14|For the love of Christ compels us, because we have concluded this: that one has died for all, therefore all have died.|This translation captures the essence of Christ's love as a powerful force that binds believers together, reflecting the commitment and intensity of this love as described in the surrounding context. The word 'constrains' is chosen to emphasize the active and compelling nature of Christ's love that drives our actions and decisions.|
|2CO 5:15|And he died for all, that those who live might no longer live for themselves, but for him who for their sake died and was raised.|In this verse, the Apostle Paul emphasizes the implications of Christ's sacrificial death, stating that His death represents a turning point for all humanity. It reflects the concept of substitutionary atonement where one man's death leads to the death of all in a spiritual sense. The focus is on the transformation of life that believers are called to live, dedicated to Christ rather than self.|
|2CO 5:16|So from now on, we regard no one according to the flesh. Even though we once regarded Christ in this way, we no longer do so.|In this verse, Paul emphasizes a shift in perspective regarding how we view others and ourselves in light of our relationship with Christ. The phrase "according to the flesh" refers to human or worldly standards of evaluation. Paul underscores the transformational impact of knowing Christ, suggesting that this knowledge changes not only our perception of Him but also of others.|
|2CO 5:17|Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation; the old has passed away; behold, the new has come!|The phrase 'new creation' emphasizes a transformative change in one's identity and state of being as a result of faith in Christ. The use of 'old' and 'new' highlights the contrast between the former way of life and the renewed life in Christ, which encompasses not just moral transformation, but a complete renewal of one's essence and purpose.|
|2CO 5:18|But all things are from God, who reconciled us to Himself through Jesus Christ and gave us the ministry of reconciliation.|In this verse, the emphasis is on God's initiative in reconciling humanity to Himself through Jesus Christ. The term 'reconciliation' is central, indicating a restored relationship between God and mankind, reflecting the theological theme found throughout Paul's writings.|
|2CO 5:19|that is, God was in Christ reconciling the world to Himself, not counting their trespasses against them, and He has entrusted to us the message of reconciliation.|This verse emphasizes God's initiative in reconciliation through Christ, reflecting the idea of divine action in restoring humanity. It presents the concept that God does not count humanity's sins against them, offering a message of hope and grace.|
|2CO 5:20|Therefore, we are ambassadors for Christ, as though God were making His appeal through us. We implore you on behalf of Christ, be reconciled to God.|In this verse, Paul emphasizes the role of believers as ambassadors for Christ, urging others to be reconciled with God. The use of 'ambassador' indicates a representative capacity, conveying the gravity and authority of the message they bear. This translation seeks to capture both the urgency and the divine calling in this appeal for reconciliation.|
|2CO 5:21|For He made the One who knew no sin to be sin for us, that we might become the righteousness of God in Him.|This verse encapsulates the concept of substitutionary atonement, where Christ, who knew no sin, became sin for humanity. The emphasis is on the transformational aspect of faith in Him, leading believers to receive God's righteousness.|
