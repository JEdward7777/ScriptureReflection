| Reference | Verse | Translation Notes |
|:---------:|-------|-------------------|
|1PE 4:1|Therefore, since Christ suffered in the flesh for us, arm yourselves also with the same mindset, because the one who has suffered in the flesh has ceased from sin.|In this verse, Peter emphasizes the importance of adopting the mindset of Christ, who suffered in the flesh for our sake. The term 'armed' reflects a preparation for facing suffering as Christ did. The use of 'suffered' and 'sin' connects to the overarching theme of living a life free from sin through Christ's redemptive suffering.|
|1PE 4:2|So as to live the rest of their time in the flesh, no longer for human desires, but for the will of God.|In this verse, the Apostle Peter emphasizes living according to God's will rather than succumbing to human desires. The Greek phrase "ἐπιθυμίαις" translates to "desires" or "lusts" and signifies strong cravings often in opposition to God's desires. The phrase "θελήματι Θεοῦ" means "the will of God," which is central to the believer's life as they navigate their existence in the flesh.|
|1PE 4:3|For you have had enough time in the past to carry out the desires of the Gentiles, indulging in sensuality, passions, drunkenness, revelries, drinking parties, and lawless idolatries.|In this verse, Peter emphasizes the sufficiency of the past life lived in sin and urges believers to forsake those actions associated with the desires of the Gentiles. The terms used here, such as "debauchery" and "idolatry," align with common New Testament themes addressing the behavior of believers and their transformation from previous lifestyles.|
|1PE 4:4|With respect to this, they are surprised when you do not join them in the same flood of debauchery, and they malign you; |This verse emphasizes the contrast between the behavior of believers and the expectations of the Gentiles. The phrase 'they are surprised' suggests a sense of astonishment that Christians no longer participate in the same activities. The term 'flood of debauchery' is translated to reflect a vivid image of excess that aligns with the original Greek. The translation aims to maintain the original meaning while making it accessible and relevant for contemporary readers.|
|1PE 4:5|But they will give an account to him who is prepared to judge the living and the dead.|In this verse, the phrase 'to him who is ready to judge' underscores the certainty of God's judgment over the living and the dead, emphasizing accountability for one's actions. The words used reflect the weight of divine authority in matters of justice and righteousness, aligning with the themes of accountability and eternal consequences.|
|1PE 4:6|For this reason the gospel was preached also to those who are dead, that they might be judged according to men in the flesh, but live according to God in the spirit.|This verse speaks of the evangelism to the dead and the judgment that follows for the living according to their actions. The phrase 'according to men in the flesh' refers to the temporal, earthly life, while 'according to God in the spirit' highlights a spiritual existence that transcends physical life. The contrast emphasizes both human judgment and divine perspective on life and death.|
|1PE 4:7|But the end of all things has drawn near. Therefore, be serious and watchful in your prayers.|The phrase 'the end of all things is at hand' signifies the urgency of being prepared for the return of Christ. The terms 'be sober' and 'watch' imply a need for self-control and alertness in spiritual matters. Prayer is emphasized as a vital response to the impending end.|
|1PE 4:8|Above all, maintain fervent love for one another, because love covers a multitude of sins.|In this verse, Peter emphasizes the importance of fervent love among believers, indicating that love not only sustains relationships but also serves as a means to cover numerous sins. The term 'fervent' suggests a passionate and committed love, which reflects the selfless nature of Christ's love for us. The implication is that through love, believers are encouraged to overlook offenses and maintain unity in the community of faith.|
|1PE 4:9|Show hospitality to one another without complaining.|The phrase 'φιλοξενοί' can be translated as 'hospitable' or 'loving strangers.' The concept emphasizes a warm welcome and acceptance, indicating an absence of complaints or murmuring in the act of hospitality. This reflects the character of the early church and their communal living, encouraging a spirit of generosity and kindness.|
|1PE 4:10|As each one has received a gift, use it to serve one another, as good stewards of the varied grace of God.|This translation captures the essence of using one's gifts for the service of others as good stewards of God's varied grace, emphasizing personal responsibility and the collective benefit of the community.|
|1PE 4:11|If anyone speaks, let him speak as one who speaks the very words of God; if anyone serves, let him serve by the strength that God provides, so that in everything God may be glorified through Jesus Christ. To Him belong glory and dominion forever and ever. Amen.|In this verse, the focus is on the manner in which believers communicate and serve. The translation emphasizes speaking as if the very words come from God and serving with His strength. This highlights the importance of divine empowerment and the ultimate purpose of glorifying God through our actions. The phrase 'in all things' is included to capture the comprehensive nature of God's glory being revealed through Jesus Christ.|
|1PE 4:12|Beloved, do not be surprised at the fiery ordeal that has come upon you, as though something strange were happening to you.|This verse addresses the response of believers to suffering and trials, encouraging them not to be surprised when they face challenges for their faith. The metaphor of fiery trials reflects the refining process that gold undergoes, suggesting that such trials are a part of the Christian experience and serve a greater purpose in developing faith and character.|
|1PE 4:13|But to the extent that you share in the sufferings of Christ, rejoice, so that when His glory is revealed, you may also rejoice with exceeding joy.|In this verse, the connection between sharing in Christ's sufferings and the joy to be found in the future revelation of His glory is emphasized. The term 'koinonia' (κοινωνεῖτε) implies a deep fellowship with Christ, particularly in His suffering, and suggests that such experiences will lead to profound joy when His glory is revealed. The use of 'χαίρετε' (rejoice) calls for an active response to suffering, rather than passive acceptance.|
|1PE 4:14|If you are reproached for the name of Christ, you are blessed, because the Spirit of glory and of God rests upon you. On their part, He is blasphemed, but on your part, He is glorified.|In this verse, the terms for blessing and the spirit of glory are deeply connected to the sufferings and name of Christ. The idea is that suffering for Christ is an honor and brings divine favor.|
|1PE 4:15|But let none of you suffer as a murderer, or a thief, or an evildoer, or as a meddler in other people's matters.|In this verse, the Apostle Peter emphasizes the importance of maintaining integrity and moral conduct among believers. The terms used reflect actions that are socially condemned and should not be associated with Christians. The context also connects back to the idea of suffering for righteousness as opposed to suffering for wrongdoing.|
|1PE 4:16|But if anyone suffers as a Christian, let him not be ashamed, but let him glorify God in that name.|This verse encourages believers to take pride in their identity as Christians and to glorify God even in times of suffering. The use of 'Christian' specifically emphasizes their association with Christ, suggesting that they should not feel shame for their faith. The instruction to glorify God in this context reflects a theme present throughout the New Testament, where believers are called to honor God through their actions and sufferings.|
|1PE 4:17|For the time has come for judgment to begin at the house of God; and if it begins with us first, what will be the end of those who do not obey the gospel of God?|This verse emphasizes the beginning of judgment starting with God's house, which highlights the importance of accountability among believers before addressing the fate of those outside the faith. It prompts a reflection on the implications of faithfulness and the seriousness of divine judgment.|
|1PE 4:18|And if the righteous are scarcely saved, where will the ungodly and the sinner appear?|This verse addresses the fate of the righteous and the unrighteous in light of impending judgment. The question posed emphasizes the uncertainty and severity of the outcome for the ungodly, mirroring the serious tone of the preceding verse about judgment beginning at the house of God.|
|1PE 4:19|Therefore, let those who suffer according to God’s will commit their souls to a faithful Creator while doing good.|In this verse, the call to entrust one’s soul to the Creator emphasizes both trust and the goodness of God. The phrase 'entrust their souls' indicates a deliberate act of surrender to God's will amidst suffering, resonating with the overall theme of hope in adversity found in Peter's letter.|
