|1PE 5:1|So I exhort the elders among you, as a fellow elder and a witness of the sufferings of Christ, as well as a partaker in the glory that is to be revealed:|The term 'elder' in this context emphasizes the role of spiritual leadership and guidance within the church community. The apostle Peter, identifying himself as a fellow elder, emphasizes humility and shared experience among leaders in the faith. The reference to being a witness of Christ's sufferings underscores the call to perseverance and faithfulness in leadership, highlighting the honor of sharing in Christ's glory that is yet to be revealed.|

It contrasts forced leadership with a willing spirit, highlighting the importance of serving without greed but rather with enthusiasm and care for the congregation.|
|1PE 5:3|not as domineering over those in your charge, but being examples to the flock.|The phrase 'not as lording over' conveys the idea of authority misused. In contrast, 'become examples' emphasizes a humble leadership that mirrors Christ's example. The terms used reflect the essence of shepherding as a selfless act rather than a position of domination.|
|1PE 5:4|And when the Chief Shepherd appears, you will receive the unfading crown of glory.|This verse speaks of the reward that faithful leaders in the church will receive from the Chief Shepherd upon His return. The word 'ἀμαράντινον' conveys the idea of an incorruptible or everlasting crown, emphasizing the eternal glory bestowed upon those who faithfully serve.|

Yes, all of you be submissive to one another, and be clothed with humility, for God opposes the proud but gives grace to the humble.|This verse encourages a spirit of humility among younger members of the community, reminding them to respect their elders. The concept of mutual submission and humility is reinforced, linking it to God's response to pride and humility, which is a recurring theme throughout Scripture.|
|1PE 5:6|Therefore, humble yourselves under the mighty hand of God, so that He may exalt you in due time.|This translation emphasizes the necessity of humility before God's powerful hand and the promise of divine exaltation at the appropriate time. The Greek word 'ταπεινώθητε' translates to 'humble yourselves' which is a call to action. 'κραταιὰν χεῖρα' reflects the might of God's hand, implying both His authority and protection. The term 'ἵνα' introduces purpose, indicating that humility leads to eventual exaltation 'ἐν καιρῷ' signifies the right moment, hinting at God's timing in lifting up the humble.|
|1PE 5:7|Cast all your worries upon Him, because He cares deeply for you.|The phrase 'casting all your anxieties on Him' indicates an active choice to relinquish our worries and place them in God’s care. The original term 'μέριμναν' implies not only anxiety but also care and concern, emphasizing the importance of trusting God with every aspect of our lives. This translation maintains the urgency and the directive nature of the original text, encouraging believers to rely on God's attention and care for their lives.|
|1PE 5:8|Be alert and of sober mind. Your enemy the devil prowls around like a roaring lion looking for someone to devour.|The phrase 'be sober' emphasizes mental clarity and moral alertness, which are critical in resisting the adversary. 'Be vigilant' indicates a constant state of readiness and awareness, particularly against spiritual threats. The imagery of the devil as a roaring lion seeking to devour reflects both the ferocity of the spiritual enemy and the seriousness of the call to be alert.|
|1PE 5:9|Stand firm against him, steadfast in your faith, knowing that the same kinds of sufferings are being accomplished in your brotherhood throughout the world.|In this verse, Peter encourages believers to resist their adversary with steadfastness in faith, reminding them that their experiences of suffering are shared with the broader community of believers. The Greek term for 'resist' suggests an active engagement against the opposition, while 'steadfast' emphasizes the necessity of firmness in one’s belief amid trials.|
|1PE 5:10|And after you have suffered a little while, the God of all grace, who has called you to his eternal glory in Christ, will himself restore, strengthen, confirm, and establish you.|This verse emphasizes God's role as the source of grace and strength for believers after they have faced suffering. The terms used for 'restore,' 'strengthen,' 'confirm,' and 'establish' highlight God's promise to not only support but also empower those who have endured trials in their faith journey. The use of the phrase 'eternal glory in Christ' underscores the ultimate purpose of our struggles and the hope we have in Him.|
|1PE 5:11|To Him belongs the glory and the power forever and ever. Amen.|The phrase 'to Him be glory and power' is a doxology, acknowledging God's ultimate authority and majesty. The phrase 'for ages of ages' emphasizes the eternal nature of God's glory and power, transcending time.|
|1PE 5:12|Through Silvanus, your faithful brother, I have written to you briefly, encouraging you and solemnly testifying that this is the true grace of God in which you stand.|In this verse, Peter refers to Silvanus (Silas) as a faithful brother and emphasizes that his message is both a brief letter of encouragement and a testament to the true grace of God. The term 'grace' and the encouragement to stand firm are central themes, reflecting a deep pastoral concern.|
|1PE 5:13|She who is in Babylon, chosen together with you, sends you greetings, and so does Mark, my son.|This verse emphasizes the connection between the church in Babylon and the person of Mark, illustrating a shared faith and community.

In the cultural context, Babylon is often interpreted as a symbol for the world system opposing God, thus enhancing the significance of mutual encouragement among believers.|
|1PE 5:14|Greet one another with a kiss of love. Peace be to all of you who are in Christ Jesus. Amen.|The phrase 'in love' emphasizes the nature of the greeting, which is meant to reflect the love shared among believers.
