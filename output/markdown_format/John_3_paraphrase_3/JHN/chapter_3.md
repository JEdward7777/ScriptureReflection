|JHN 3:2|One night, a man named Nicodemus came to see Jesus. He said, 'Teacher, we know that you have come from God because no one could do the amazing things you do unless God is with him.'|This verse highlights the respect Nicodemus had for Jesus and acknowledges that Jesus performed miracles that showed he was sent by God.

|JHN 3:14|Just like Moses lifted up the snake in the desert, the Son of Man must be lifted up too.|This verse uses the story of Moses lifting up the bronze serpent to illustrate how Jesus, referred to as the Son of Man, must be lifted up as well.
