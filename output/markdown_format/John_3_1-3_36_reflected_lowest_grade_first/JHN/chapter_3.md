|:---------:|-------|-------------------|
|JHN 3:1|Now there was a man of the Pharisees, named Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews.|To improve the translation of JHN 3:1, I will ensure that I use 'a ruler of the Jews' and 'a man of the Pharisees' for accuracy in reflecting Nicodemus's status. I will enhance the clarity and readability by using straightforward phrases while ensuring I remain faithful to the literal meaning of the Greek text. I will avoid unnecessary commentary to stay true to the goal of a strict translation. Overall, my focus will be on producing a clear, accurate, and contextually appropriate translation that aligns with conservative Christian values without adding excessive interpretation.|
|JHN 3:2|This man came to Him at night and said to Him, 'Rabbi, we know that You are a teacher sent by God, for no one can perform the miraculous signs that You do unless God is with him.'|To create an updated translation of JHN 3:2 that fulfills the outlined correction criteria, I will simplify phrases for clarity while preserving theological significance. I will ensure that Nicodemus's recognition of Jesus's divine authority is explicitly reflected in the translation. The language will remain formal enough to respect the traditional text but will also be accessible to contemporary readers. I'll structure the translation to enhance flow and readability while maintaining fidelity to the original Greek structure. Finally, I will specify 'miraculous signs' to accurately describe Jesus's works in line with conservative interpretations.|
|JHN 3:3|Jesus answered him, 'Truly, truly, I say to you, unless one is born from above, he cannot enter the kingdom of God.'<br><br>*(Footnote: The phrase 'born from above' indicates a necessary spiritual rebirth, highlighting the transformative nature of faith in Christ as essential for entering God's kingdom.)*|In the translation of JHN 3:3, I will adhere to the corrections provided. I will choose to use 'born from above' for consistency, given its theological significance in the context of spiritual rebirth. I will ensure to change 'see' to 'enter' when referring to the 'kingdom of God' to enhance clarity regarding the meaning of entering God's domain. For the footnote, I will maintain traditional formatting and ensure that it contributes to understanding without being obtrusive. Additionally, I will focus on maintaining a formal tone throughout the translation to align with biblical texts while remaining faithful to the original Greek.|
|JHN 3:4|Nicodemus said to Him, 'How can an old man be born again? Is it possible for him to enter his mother’s womb a second time and be born?'<br><br>*(Contextual Note: The phrase 'born again' refers to a necessary spiritual rebirth for entering God's kingdom, highlighting the transformative nature of faith in Christ as explained by Jesus to Nicodemus.)*|In addressing the corrections for JHN 3:4, I need to ensure that the term 'born again' is retained while still providing context for its spiritual significance. The phrasing of the questions must be adjusted for fluidity, and I must ensure that the structure of the original Greek text is respected. This means making the questions clearer and more accessible to the reader. I will include a brief contextual note to explain the significance of the term 'born again'. Overall, I need to maintain a balance between literal fidelity to the Greek text and the readability of the English translation.|
|JHN 3:5|Jesus answered, "Truly, truly, I say to you, unless one is born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter the kingdom of God." <br>*(Contextual Note: 'Born of water' indicates the importance of baptism, while 'born of the Spirit' signifies the essential spiritual rebirth necessary for entering God's kingdom.)*|In revising JHN 3:5, I will focus on creating a clear distinction between 'born of water' and 'born of the Spirit' while keeping the theological implications consistent with a conservative Christian perspective. I will strive to maintain fidelity to the original Greek without unnecessary additions, ensuring the translation accurately reflects the text's meaning. Additionally, I will refine the contextual note to emphasize its theological significance without being overly interpretative. Improving the fluidity and readability of the translation will be key, while still retaining its theological richness.|
|JHN 3:6|That which has been birthed from the flesh is flesh, and that which has been birthed from the Spirit is spirit. <br>*(Theological Note: This verse draws a clear distinction between physical birth, which results in a human existence, and spiritual birth, which gives rise to a new spiritual identity. It underscores the necessity of spiritual rebirth for entering into a true relationship with God, linking this concept to the broader discourse on regeneration in the preceding verses.)*|To enhance the translation of John 3:6, I will ensure the distinction between physical and spiritual birth is clear. I will rephrase the verse for improved readability while keeping its theological significance intact. Additionally, I will refine the theological note to emphasize its relevance and connection to surrounding verses about spiritual rebirth. I'll also ensure originality in phrasing to prevent plagiarism and maintain consistent formatting across notes and footnotes.|
|JHN 3:7|"Do not marvel that I said to you, 'You must be born again from above.'"  <br>*(Contextual Note: 'Born from above' signifies the necessity of spiritual rebirth, emphasizing its importance for entering the kingdom of God.)*|To improve the translation of JHN 3:7, I will incorporate the suggested revisions while ensuring that the meaning remains faithful to the original Greek text. The phrasing 'Do not be amazed' will be adjusted to 'Do not marvel' to enhance the sense of wonder, and I'll simplify the address to Nicodemus by using 'you' instead of 'you all'. I will also emphasize the urgency of the message by rephrasing to 'You must be born again from above.' The goal is to balance fidelity to the source text with clarity and engagement for modern readers while respecting the theological implications of being 'born from above.'|
|JHN 3:8|"The Spirit blows where it wills, and you hear its voice; yet you do not know where it comes from or where it goes. So it is with everyone who has been born of the Spirit."  <br><br>*(Contextual Note: This verse highlights the sovereign and mysterious nature of the work of the Holy Spirit in spiritual rebirth, illustrating that while the activity of the Spirit may be perceived, its origins and destinations remain beyond human understanding.)*|In revising JHN 3:8, I will ensure that I adhere closely to the source text while implementing the corrections provided. I will maintain a formal tone and capitalize 'Spirit' for consistency. The choice of 'blows' will be retained to enhance clarity and convey the metaphorical sense of movement associated with the Holy Spirit. I will also ensure that the phrasing is simplified for better readability without losing the original meaning. Moreover, I will preserve the theological nuance of sovereignty by using 'wills' and provide a concise contextual note that highlights the significance of spiritual rebirth without overwhelming the literal translation with too much interpretative commentary. The final translation will be faithful to the Greek text while reflecting a conservative Christian understanding.|
|JHN 3:9|Nicodemus answered and said to Him, "How can these things be?"|In this verse, Nicodemus expresses confusion regarding the spiritual rebirth that Jesus has just described. The Greek word 'ἀπεκρίθη' indicates a direct response to Jesus, showing his incredulity. The phrase 'πῶς δύναται' captures the questioning tone, emphasizing the impossibility he perceives in Jesus' teaching.|
|JHN 3:10|Jesus answered and said to him, 'You are Israel's instructor, and yet you do not understand these things?'  <br>*(Footnote: As a Pharisee and prominent instructor of the law, Nicodemus was expected to possess profound spiritual insight. Jesus's question serves as a rhetorical challenge, illustrating the disconnect between Nicodemus's academic knowledge of the law and the profound spiritual truths being presented, underscoring the limitations of mere scholarly understanding in light of divine revelation.)*|To implement the corrections effectively, I will replace 'teacher' with 'instructor' to enhance the authoritative connotation of Nicodemus's role. I will also clarify that he is a teacher of the law in the footnote. The translation will retain a formal tone to respect the scripture's context. Additionally, I will emphasize the rhetorical challenge posed by Jesus to highlight Nicodemus's misunderstanding more clearly. Lastly, I will streamline the footnote to make it more concise while ensuring it provides essential context for readers.|
|JHN 3:11|Truly, truly, I say to you, we speak of what we know and testify to what we have seen, yet you do not accept our testimony.|This verse emphasizes the authority of Jesus' testimony and the truth of what He knows, contrasted with the refusal of the audience to accept that testimony. The repetition of 'Amen' signifies the importance and certainty of the statement being made.|
|JHN 3:12|"If I have told you about earthly things and you do not believe, how will you believe if I tell you about heavenly things?"  <br>*(Contextual Note: This verse emphasizes the necessity of faith to grasp spiritual truths, highlighting the challenge of understanding divine concepts when foundational earthly ideas are not accepted.)*|In translating JHN 3:12, I will focus on maintaining fidelity to the original Greek text while ensuring clarity for modern readers. I will rephrase 'earthly matters' and 'heavenly matters' to better reflect the original meaning and emphasize the challenge of belief in divine truths. The contextual note will be simplified to convey the importance of faith succinctly. I'll also ensure that the translation retains a formal tone appropriate for biblical texts and is distinct from existing translations to avoid plagiarism. The aim is to achieve a balance between literal accuracy and readability for a conservative Christian audience.|
|JHN 3:13|"And no one has ascended into heaven except the Son of Man, who came down from heaven and is in heaven."  <br>*(Footnote: This verse highlights the unique authority of Jesus Christ as the only mediator between God and humanity, emphasizing His dual nature as both divine and human, and underscoring the importance of His mission on earth as the incarnate Son of God.)*|I will simplify the phrase 'currently in heaven' to 'who is in heaven' to provide a clearer and more literal translation. Additionally, I will enhance the phrase 'Son of Man' to emphasize its dual nature and authority while ensuring the language remains conservative. I will remove redundancy in the text to improve fluidity, and the footnote will explain the theological significance without being overly complex. Lastly, I will review punctuation and grammar for clarity.|
|JHN 3:14|"And just as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, so must the Son of Man be lifted up." <br>*(Contextual Note: This verse draws a parallel between Moses lifting the serpent as a means of healing for the Israelites and the necessity of Jesus's crucifixion, illustrating how faith in Christ serves as the means of spiritual salvation, echoing the redemptive purpose of His sacrifice.)*|To enhance the translation of JHN 3:14 while adhering closely to the literal meaning of the Greek text, I will focus on removing any interpretative additions that could detract from the direct translation. The phrase 'indicating His crucifixion, so that those who look to Him in faith may be saved' will be omitted or revised to strictly reflect the text. In explaining the connection between Moses lifting the serpent and Christ's role, I will include a brief contextual note that elucidates the typological significance of this act, thus preserving theological integrity. The goal is to balance clarity and fidelity without adding unnecessary interpretative layers.|
|JHN 3:15|"so that everyone who believes in Him will not perish, but may have everlasting life." *(Contextual Note: This verse encapsulates the Christian doctrine of salvation through faith in Jesus Christ. The phrase 'will not perish' affirms the assurance of salvation for genuine believers, signifying that true faith not only transforms one’s eternal destiny but also influences daily living. 'Everlasting life' refers not just to the length of existence but to a quality of life enriched by a personal relationship with God, characterized by peace, joy, and purpose. In conservative Christian thought, this passage underscores that authentic belief is reflected in a life committed to living according to Christ's teachings, embodying the transformative power of faith in all aspects of life.)*|In order to enhance the clarity and readability of the verse, I will modify the phrasing to emphasize the certainty of salvation. I will use 'may have everlasting life' instead of 'may possess everlasting life', as this aligns better with common conservative Christian terminology. I will also change 'may not perish' to 'will not perish' to present a stronger assurance in the promise. The term 'everlasting life' will be used consistently throughout to maintain terminological alignment. Additionally, I will expand on the contextual notes to delve deeper into the implications of belief in Jesus and how it affects daily living, highlighting the transformative aspects of faith. The language will be refined to ensure uniqueness while preserving the literal meaning. Redundancies in the contextual notes will be minimized to streamline the insights regarding the importance of faith and its transformative nature. I will emphasize that genuine belief involves a commitment to living according to Christ's teachings, reflecting a life that is transformed by that faith, in alignment with conservative Christian values.|
|JHN 3:16|"For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, so that everyone who believes in Him may not perish but have eternal life."  <br>*(Theological Note: This verse powerfully illustrates the depth of God's love for humanity, showing that giving His only begotten Son represents the ultimate sacrifice. Belief in Jesus is essential for eternal life, indicating that true faith transforms not only one’s eternal destiny but also fosters a profound relationship with God.)*|To revise JHN 3:16 effectively, I will keep the phrase 'only begotten Son' to align with traditional theological perspectives. I will simplify 'puts their trust in Him' to 'believes in Him' to ensure clarity and consistency with conventional translations. Furthermore, I will enhance clarity by reverting to 'may not perish but have eternal life,' as this phrase resonates better with contemporary readers. The theological note will be crafted to emphasize God's immense love and the necessity of believing in Jesus, while avoiding language similar to existing translations to ensure originality.|
|JHN 3:17|For God did not send His Son into the world to condemn the world, but that the world might be saved through Him.|This verse emphasizes God's purpose in sending His Son, focusing on salvation rather than judgment. The terms used in this verse highlight God's intent to rescue rather than to condemn, providing a clear statement about the mission of Jesus in relation to the world.|
|JHN 3:18|He who believes in Him is not condemned; but he who does not believe is already condemned, because he has not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God.|In updating the translation of JHN 3:18, I will revert to the traditional phrase 'the only begotten Son of God' to align with the preferences of conservative Christian audiences. This phraseology is more familiar and resonates deeply with traditional theological perspectives. I will ensure that the overall flow and readability are enhanced without sacrificing theological accuracy. The Greek text will be closely adhered to, maintaining the original meaning. Furthermore, I'll take care to ensure originality in my wording to avoid plagiarism from existing translations, while still remaining faithful to the text.|
|JHN 3:19|"And this is the verdict: the light has come into the world, and people loved darkness more than the light, because their deeds were evil."  <br>*(Footnote: In this passage, 'light' symbolizes divine truth and God's presence, while 'darkness' signifies spiritual ignorance and moral failure. The preference for darkness indicates a rejection of God's truth, illustrating the conflict between divine righteousness and human sinfulness. This serves as a reminder of moral accountability in response to God's revelation.)*|To enhance clarity and readability while maintaining the authoritative tone, I will consider how the phrase can be simplified without losing its meaning. I will keep the term 'verdict' for its judicial connotation, aiming for a structure that remains close to the original Greek. Additionally, I'll streamline the footnote to avoid redundancy, while still providing theological insights regarding the nature of light and darkness, as well as the implications of judgment and spiritual condemnation. I will ensure the translation is original and adheres to the specified guidelines.|
|JHN 3:20|For everyone who practices evil hates the light and does not come into the light so that his deeds will not be exposed.<br>*(Footnote: 'Light' in John's theology represents truth and righteousness, while 'deeds' refers to one's actions that can be judged by God. The rejection of the light signifies a preference for darkness and a life not aligned with divine truth.)*|In updating JHN 3:20, I will prioritize clarity and accessibility while ensuring the translation remains faithful to the original Greek. I will replace 'lest' with 'so that' for better understanding, keeping the core meaning intact. Additionally, I will focus on simplifying the sentence structure without losing the depth of the theological message. Footnotes will be added to explain the significance of 'light' and 'deeds,' while also highlighting the moral dichotomy between light and darkness as emphasized in John's theology.|
|JHN 3:21|But the one who practices the Truth comes into the light, so that his works are evident, having been accomplished in God.<br>*(Contextual Note: This verse underscores the importance of living in accordance with God's Truth and coming into His light, suggesting that true alignment with God's will is evidenced by one’s actions being reflective of divine intention and righteousness.)*|In re-evaluating JHN 3:21, the objective is to enhance the translation while maintaining fidelity to the original text. First, I will use 'the one who practices the Truth' to preserve Greek alignment, but I will also consider 'the one who does the truth' for traditional resonance. Regarding 'the light', using 'the light of God' could provide greater specificity but might deviate from the original text; hence I will retain 'the light'. For the phrase 'that his works are done in God', I will adjust this to reflect the original nuance more clearly without complicating the sentence structure, perhaps using 'so that his works are evident, having been accomplished in God'. Additionally, I'll ensure 'Truth' is capitalized when referring to Christ and keep the contextual note focused on theological implications without overshadowing the translation itself. This approach will meet the correction requirements while ensuring the verse is both understandable and true to its original meaning.|
|JHN 3:22|After this, Jesus and his disciples went into Judea, and there he remained with them and baptized.|In updating the translation of JHN 3:22, I will prioritize accuracy by replacing 'spent time with them' with 'remained with them' to better reflect the Greek term 'διέτριβε.' Additionally, I will simplify 'Judean countryside' to 'Judea' for conciseness while maintaining clarity and a biblical tone. The updated translation will reflect a more literal rendering of the text, capturing the continuous nature of Jesus' presence with his disciples. I will also ensure that the theological implications of baptism in this context are acknowledged, even if indirectly, by maintaining a straightforward narrative style.|
|JHN 3:23|John was also baptizing at Aenon near Salim, because there was plenty of water there; and people were coming and being baptized.|This translation emphasizes the location and activity of John the Baptist, clarifying the abundance of water present, which made baptism possible. The term for 'baptizing' is rendered consistently to reflect the practice associated with John.|
|JHN 3:24|For John had not yet been thrown into prison.|In this verse, the emphasis is on the fact that John had not yet been imprisoned at the time of the events described, highlighting the chronological aspect of his ministry and baptism before any arrest occurred.|
|JHN 3:25|Then a dispute arose between some of John’s disciples and a Jew about ritual purification.|In this reflection, I will incorporate the corrections provided while focusing on maintaining the integrity of the translation. I will keep the term 'dispute' to accurately convey the conflict between the disciples and the Jewish individual. I will choose 'a Jew' as it fits the context without suggesting a specific group like the Pharisees, which may lead to misinterpretations. To enhance clarity, I will refine 'regarding purification' to 'about ritual purification,' making it clearer to modern readers. The context notes will be kept concise to support understanding without overshadowing the verse's main focus. I aim for a fluid yet faithful representation of the original text that aligns with conservative Christian standards.|
|JHN 3:26|And they came to John and said to him, 'Rabbi, the one who was with you across the Jordan, whom you have testified about, look, he is baptizing, and everyone is going to him.'|This verse highlights the rising popularity of Jesus' ministry in comparison to John's. The word 'baptizes' here emphasizes the act of purification and initiation into a new faith, which is a central theme throughout the Gospels. Additionally, the reference to 'everyone' coming to Jesus indicates a broad appeal and the growing recognition of his role as the Messiah.|
|JHN 3:27|John answered and said, 'A man cannot receive anything unless it has been bestowed upon him from Heaven.'|In translating JHN 3:27, I will focus on correcting the grammatical error by changing 'received' to 'receive' to maintain the proper verb tense. I will also keep the term 'anything' for clarity and directness. Ensuring consistent capitalization of 'He' when referring to God is essential for theological respect and clarity. To replace 'granted', I will select a synonym that fits the context well, such as 'bestowed', which maintains the theological nuance while being contemporary. Lastly, I will make minor adjustments for readability, ensuring that the verse flows smoothly without altering its intended meaning.|
|JHN 3:28|You yourselves testify that I said, 'I am not the Christ, but I am the forerunner sent before Him.'|To revise JHN 3:28, I will implement the suggested corrections, focusing on traditional terminology and structural clarity while ensuring that the translation remains faithful to the original Greek text. I will substitute 'messenger' with 'forerunner' to align with the recommended terminology that resonates well with conservative Christian audiences. Additionally, I will include 'the' before 'Christ' for precision and maintain the phrase 'sent before Him' to reflect the original intent of the text accurately. The phrase 'You yourselves testify' will replace 'You all bear witness' to enhance fluency and clarity, adhering to the original meaning. The aim is to create a clear, original translation that is both theologically sound and reflective of the original scripture's intent.|
|JHN 3:29|The one who possesses the bride is the bridegroom; but the friend of the bridegroom, who stands and listens to him, rejoices greatly at the bridegroom's voice. Therefore, my joy has been made full.|I will revise JHN 3:29 to reflect a more literal interpretation, particularly focusing on the phrase concerning joy. Instead of 'my joy is now complete,' I will use 'my joy has been made full' to enhance the literal accuracy of the translation while maintaining clarity. This adjustment aligns with the peer feedback received during the review process. Overall, I want to ensure that the metaphor of the bride and bridegroom remains prominent, capturing both the relational and emotional aspects expressed in the original text.|
|JHN 3:30|"He must increase, but I must decrease."  <br>*(Contextual Note: This profound declaration by John the Baptist illustrates the essence of his mission as the forerunner of Christ. 'He must increase' signifies that Christ's authority, presence, and influence should grow in the hearts of believers, while 'I must decrease' reflects John's humility and willingness to step aside, acknowledging that Christ must be exalted. This teaches contemporary believers the vital importance of prioritizing Christ above all else, recognizing that true greatness is found in humility and service to Him. John’s statement calls Christians to evaluate their lives in relation to Christ's mission, encouraging them to diminish self and allow Christ to shine forth through their actions and witness.)*|In updating JHN 3:30, I will ensure the translation remains literal while enhancing the contextual note to reflect John the Baptist's role and its implications for believers today. I will articulate the themes of humility and prioritizing Christ in clear, engaging language. This approach should resonate with conservative Christian values and provide a rich understanding of the verse.|
|JHN 3:31|He who comes from above is above all; the one who is from the earth is earthly and speaks in an earthly manner. He who comes from heaven is above all.|To refine the translation of JHN 3:31, I will focus on enhancing clarity, emphasizing the theological significance of Christ's authority, and strengthening the distinction between the earthly and heavenly perspectives. I will simplify the language to improve readability, avoid redundancy, and maintain a fluid structure while ensuring fidelity to the original Greek text. The objective is to make the translation accessible to contemporary readers while preserving its deep theological meaning.|
|JHN 3:32|"And what he has seen and heard, this is what he testifies; yet no one accepts his testimony."|To enhance the fluidity and readability of John 3:32, I will rephrase key elements while maintaining the meaning of the original text. I will specify that 'he' refers to John the Baptist to avoid ambiguity. I will also consider adding commentary that highlights the importance of belief versus unbelief, ensuring that the translation remains distinct from known versions while capturing the essence of the Greek text. I'll ensure consistent terminology regarding the words used for belief and acceptance. Overall, I aim to create a translation that is both faithful to the source and accessible for contemporary readers.|
|JHN 3:33|"The one who accepts his testimony seals that God is true." <br><br>*Footnote: This affirmation signifies the believer's trust in the integrity of God's character as revealed through His Son. Accepting Christ's testimony not only demonstrates faith but also underscores the divine authority of His words and the truth of God's promises, encouraging believers to embrace His nature.*|To align the translation of JHN 3:33 with the provided corrections, I will retain the essence of the original phrase while enhancing the terminology to reflect a more literal rendering of 'ἐσφράγισεν'. I will also ensure that the footnote is expanded to provide deeper theological insight, making it clear how accepting the testimony of Christ relates to the nature of God and faith. I will prioritize clarity for modern readers while adhering to a conservative Christian interpretation.|
|JHN 3:34|"For the one whom God has sent speaks God's words; for God gives the Spirit without measure." <br><br>*Footnote: The phrase 'without measure' emphasizes the limitless and abundant nature of the Spirit given by God, indicating that the fullness of the Spirit is bestowed upon Jesus, empowering Him to fulfill His divine mission and to reveal the fullness of God to humanity.*|In translating JHN 3:34, I will focus on creating a version that is both literal and easy to understand while maintaining the theological depth of the original text. The phrase 'without measure' will be retained as it conveys significant theological meaning, and I will ensure clarity around this concept. I will also simplify the language where appropriate and include a footnote to provide additional context about the phrase 'the Spirit without measure' to enhance understanding for contemporary readers. Overall, my aim is to preserve the original meaning while making it accessible and coherent.|
|JHN 3:35|The Father loves the Son and has given all things into His hand.|In reviewing JHN 3:35, it is crucial to maintain a literal translation that reflects the original Greek structure while ensuring clarity. The suggestion to adjust the term 'everything' to something more precise could involve using 'all things' or 'all' to enhance fidelity. The goal is to retain the original phrasing and rhythm where possible. This will help in maintaining the emphasis on the Father's relationship with the Son and the completeness of the entrustment. By restructuring the translation slightly, I aim to enhance the overall coherence without compromising on accuracy.|
|JHN 3:36|The one who believes in the Son has eternal life; but the one who does not believe in the Son does not have life, but the wrath of God remains upon him.|To revise JHN 3:36, I will carefully consider the corrections suggested while ensuring that the integrity of the original text is maintained. I will adopt the recommended phrasing adjustments for clarity, improving readability through strategic word choices. The modifications will reflect theological precision, especially regarding the implications of belief and unbelief on one's relationship with God. I will also enhance the nuance of the term 'wrath' to accurately convey its spiritual consequences. Overall, the goal is to create a translation that is both literal and easy to understand, keeping the theological context intact.|
