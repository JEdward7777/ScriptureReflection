| Reference | Verse | Translation Notes |
|:---------:|-------|-------------------|
|JHN 3:1|One night, a man named Nicodemus came to see Jesus. He was a religious leader who taught about God and helped lead the Jewish people.|To create an updated translation of John 3:1 that is easy for a seven-year-old to understand, I will simplify the language further, clarify the context of Nicodemus' visit, and provide a brief explanation of who the Pharisees were without overwhelming the child with information.|
|JHN 3:2|One night, a Jewish leader named Nicodemus came to talk to Jesus. He said, 'Teacher, we know you are someone special who has come from God. Only God could help someone do the amazing things you do.'|To improve the translation, I will incorporate feedback from my teachers while ensuring the language remains simple for a seven-year-old. I'll clarify Nicodemus's role as a Jewish leader, mention that he visited Jesus at night, and replace 'wonderful things' with 'amazing things' to make it clearer. I will also ensure that the translation flows well with the preceding verse, maintaining the context and respect Nicodemus shows toward Jesus.|
|JHN 3:3|Jesus answered, "Pay attention! If anyone doesn't have a new start and be like a child, they can't see God's Kingdom."|To ensure clarity and child-friendliness, I will refine the wording while emphasizing the importance of being 'born again' in a spiritual sense. I will replace 'little baby' with 'like a child' to better align with the biblical context of faith. Additionally, I will enhance the urgency of the message while maintaining an accessible tone for a seven-year-old audience.|
|JHN 3:4-5|Nicodemus asked Jesus, "How can someone be born again when they are already old? Can they enter their mom's tummy again to be born?" Jesus replied, "Listen carefully! No one can enter God’s Kingdom unless they are born of water and the Spirit. This means we need to receive a new life from God in our hearts."|To revise the translation of JHN 3:4-5 for a seven-year-old, I'll soften Nicodemus's question to be more respectful while still retaining the essence of confusion he feels. I will also clarify the concepts of 'water' and 'Spirit' to emphasize their importance in the context of being born again. This revision needs to maintain the overall flow and connection to the previous verse (JHN 3:3) while ensuring it's easily understood by young readers. I'll link 'God’s special world' explicitly to 'the Kingdom of God' for clarity and make sure the overall message remains true to the theological intent.|
|JHN 3:6|People can only be born as babies from their moms. But when someone is born again from God's Spirit, it means they receive God's love and help. They become part of God's family and start a new life filled with joy and kindness.|To revise the translation of John 3:6 for a seven-year-old, I'll aim to keep the language simple and relatable while enhancing theological clarity. I will explicitly mention 'being born again' to tie it closely to the previous verses. I'll also clarify what it means to receive a new life from God's Spirit, possibly connecting it to feelings of love and belonging to God’s family.|
|JHN 3:7|So, don't be surprised when I tell you that everyone needs to be born again to be in God's family and have a happy life with Him.|To revise the translation, I'll focus on making it even more straightforward for a seven-year-old, ensuring that it highlights the importance of being born again and explicitly connects this idea to being part of God's family. I'll simplify the language further and incorporate elements that stress the significance of spiritual rebirth and transformation.|
|JHN 3:8|The wind blows wherever it wants. You can hear it, but you don’t know where it comes from or where it goes. It’s the same with the Spirit. When someone believes in Jesus and is born again by the Spirit, they feel a special change inside that helps them live for God, even if we can’t see it happening on the outside.|I need to ensure that the updated translation for JHN 3:8 connects smoothly with JHN 3:7. The goal is to maintain simplicity for a seven-year-old while deepening the theological insight about being 'born again' and the role of the Spirit. I will use familiar imagery and reinforce the connection to faith in Jesus to align with conservative Christian beliefs.|
|JHN 3:9|Nicodemus was very confused and said, "How can someone start over and be born again? I just don’t get it! What does it mean to be born in a new way?" This special change happens when God’s Spirit comes into our hearts to help us live for Him.|To revise JHN 3:9 for a seven-year-old, I'll incorporate a clear explanation of what 'born again' means while maintaining the context of Nicodemus's confusion. I'll also ensure that the message aligns with conservative Christian teachings, emphasizing the spiritual transformation as a gift from God. This will help clarify the connection to the Spirit mentioned in the previous verse without complicating the language.|
|JHN 3:10|Jesus answered, 'You are a teacher for the people of Israel, but you don’t understand these important things? That’s surprising!'|I will incorporate the feedback from my teachers by adding context about Nicodemus' role as a teacher and by using clearer language that resonates with a seven-year-old's comprehension. I need to maintain a tone that reflects Jesus' authority while making it accessible. Therefore, I'll use 'important things' instead of 'big ideas' and highlight that Nicodemus should know these concepts since he is a teacher.|
|JHN 3:11-12|"I’m telling you something really important! We are sharing things we know and have seen about God, but you don’t believe us. If I tell you about things here on Earth and you don’t believe me, how can I expect you to believe when I talk about God’s home?"|I want to ensure that my revised translation maintains clarity and simplicity for a seven-year-old while effectively conveying the authority of Jesus and the importance of belief. I will incorporate suggestions from my teachers about making it relatable and emphasizing the contrast between earthly and heavenly truths. Additionally, I need to create a clear connection between JHN 3:10 and JHN 3:11-12.|
|JHN 3:13|No one has ever gone to Heaven, except for Jesus. He is the Son of Man who came down from Heaven to show us the way. He knows Heaven like no one else does.|I want to ensure the translation remains simple enough for a seven-year-old to understand while retaining key theological elements like Jesus's identity as the Son of Man and the unique aspect of His coming down from Heaven. It's important to relate the verse back to the previous context, emphasizing the credibility of Jesus's teachings about Heaven. I'll also make sure to clarify that Jesus has a special connection to Heaven.|
|JHN 3:14|Just like Moses lifted up a snake on a pole so that anyone who looked at it could be healed, Jesus will also be lifted up. When people look to Him and believe, they can be saved. Just like the people needed to trust and look at the snake to get better, we need to trust Jesus to help us too.|To revise the translation for John 3:14, I will maintain clarity and simplicity while emphasizing the importance of faith in Jesus for salvation. I will include an explanation about why looking at the snake was significant, which will help young children understand the analogy better. I'll also ensure the transition from the previous verse is smooth, connecting the idea of Moses' snake to Jesus' role in salvation.|
|JHN 3:15|So anyone who trusts in Jesus will not be lost, but will have the joy of living forever with God, just like the people who looked at the snake and were healed. Trusting in Jesus is like looking to Him for help; it brings us happiness and life forever with God.|To create a paraphrase that effectively communicates the message of trust in Jesus and the concept of eternal life in a way a seven-year-old can easily understand, I will tie the translation to the context of John 3:14. I will emphasize the idea of faith as something that brings joy and happiness, connecting it with the healing metaphor from the previous verse about Moses and the snake. This will help reinforce the importance of believing in Jesus.|
|JHN 3:16|God loves everyone in the world so much that He gave us His one and only Son. If you trust in Jesus, you will not be lost; instead, you will get to live forever with God.|To create a paraphrase suitable for a seven-year-old, I will incorporate the teachers' corrections while keeping the language simple and relatable. I will focus on emphasizing trust in Jesus as a personal relationship, maintain clarity, and ensure the essence of the verse is communicated without using complex terms.|

He sent Him so that everyone who believes in Jesus can be saved and live happily with God forever.|To revise the translation of John 3:17, I need to incorporate feedback that emphasizes the concept of salvation and belief in Jesus while ensuring the language remains accessible to a seven-year-old. I will replace 'safe and happy' with 'saved' to clarify the idea of salvation, and include a reference to believing in Jesus as essential for that salvation, all while maintaining a simple and clear style.|
|JHN 3:18|If you believe in God’s Son, you will be safe and happy forever with Him. But if you don’t believe, you are choosing to be away from God's love and you won’t be with Him forever.|I want to ensure that the updated translation clearly communicates the message of John 3:18 in a way that's simple for a seven-year-old to understand, while also respecting the theological implications of belief in Jesus and the consequences of disbelief. It should emphasize the importance of faith and the idea of eternal life, as well as the serious nature of the choice regarding belief.|
|JHN 3:19|Here’s how it is: God sent Jesus to be the light and show us the right way. But some people liked their sins more than the light because they didn’t want to change. They chose to stay in the dark instead of coming close to God and His love.|To revise the translation of John 3:19, I'll incorporate feedback about using biblical terminology while ensuring the language remains simple for a seven-year-old. The goal is to emphasize the contrast between light and darkness and the choice involved, integrating the idea of God's love from the previous verse without making it too complex.|
|JHN 3:20|Some people do bad things and don't want anyone to see them, so they stay away from God's light. But God’s light is loving and shows us the right way to live. He wants us to come closer to Him and make better choices.|To create an updated translation for John 3:20, I'll focus on maintaining the simplicity necessary for a seven-year-old while incorporating the feedback regarding God's love and the importance of His light. I need to highlight the concept of God as a guide and the invitation to come towards Him rather than just the avoidance aspect.|
|JHN 3:21|But those who do what is right come to God’s light so everyone can see that their good deeds show they are following God.|Incorporating the feedback provided, I will emphasize the connection between coming to the light and truth, while making sure to clarify that the good deeds show a person's commitment to God. I need to ensure that the language is simple enough for a seven-year-old to understand, while also retaining the theological integrity of the message.|
|JHN 3:22|After that, Jesus and His helpers went to Judea, where they talked to the people and taught them about God's love and how to live kindly. They baptized people in water to show that they wanted to follow Jesus and do good things with God's help.|I will revise the translation of John 3:22 to ensure clarity and accuracy, particularly focusing on the act of baptism and the teachings of Jesus. I need to keep the language simple enough for a seven-year-old while ensuring that it reflects the theological significance of the actions described.|
|JHN 3:23|At the same time, John the Baptist was in a place called Aenon, near Salim, where there was a lot of water. Many people came to John to be baptized, which means they wanted to show that they loved God and wanted to follow Him better.|I will revise the translation to incorporate the feedback from my teachers while keeping it simple and comprehensible for a seven-year-old. The key points include emphasizing baptism as an important act and maintaining clarity about John the Baptist's role. I will ensure the revised translation is consistent with the preceding context about Jesus and His ministry.|
|JHN 3:24|At that time, John the Baptist was not in prison yet, which was important because many people were coming to him to show they loved God.|To improve the translation, I will ensure that it remains simple for a seven-year-old while also providing a bit more context about John the Baptist's role. This will help children understand the significance of the statement about John not being in prison yet, especially in relation to the events of his ministry. The revised translation will highlight John's importance and clarify the timeline of his situation without overcomplicating the language.|
|JHN 3:25|Some of John’s friends were talking to a Jewish man, asking questions about how to be good and make God happy. They wanted to know about the special things people do to show they love God.|To refine the translation, I will simplify the language while ensuring it is relatable to a seven-year-old. I'll clarify the context by mentioning that the followers were asking about specific religious practices, making the idea of purity more concrete. Additionally, I'll focus on using phrases that are familiar and easy to understand for children, keeping the essence of the original text intact.|
|JHN 3:26|Some of John's friends came to him and said, "Teacher, do you remember that man who was with you on the other side of the river? You said he was very special. Now he is baptizing people and helping them get ready to follow God, and everyone is going to him!"|To ensure the revised translation effectively conveys the core message of John 3:26, it is important to maintain clarity while emphasizing the identity of Jesus as the Messiah and the significance of baptism. I will replace 'splashing water' with 'baptizing' to reflect the sacred act, and also make the phrase about following God more prominent for better understanding. Additionally, I will retain age-appropriate language to connect with a seven-year-old audience.|
|JHN 3:27|John replied, "Nobody can have anything unless God gives it to them. Just like when someone gives you a gift, everything we have is because God shares it with us."|To create an accessible paraphrase for a seven-year-old, I'll maintain the key messages of dependence on God and His role as the giver of everything. I'll simplify the language further by emphasizing God's direct giving while making the analogy of sharing gifts clearer. This will ensure that young readers understand the significance of God's sovereignty and the context of baptism, as presented in JHN 3:26.|
|JHN 3:28|You all know I said, 'I am not the one God sent, who is called Jesus. I am just a person sent by God to share the good news about Jesus.'|In revising the translation of John 3:28, I want to ensure clarity and accuracy, especially for a young audience. I will replace 'the special one from God called the Christ' with 'the one God sent, who is called Jesus' to provide a direct link to the figure of Jesus while maintaining the theological significance of 'Christ.' I will also clarify 'good news about Him' by adding 'about Jesus' to specify who the message is focused on. This will help children understand that the message is about salvation and God's love through Jesus. Overall, the goal is to keep the language simple and relatable, ensuring it connects well with the context of John 3:27.|
