Suggested enhancements include: 1. **Clarity and Depth**: Rephrase 'Mais il ne lui répondit pas un mot' to emphasize the silence of Jesus and deepen the interaction's context. 2. **Tone and Emotion**: More explicitly convey the urgency and desperation of the woman's plea, ensuring the emotional elements are prominent in the translation. 3. **Phrasing and Readability**: Consider using more literal translations, such as 'fais-la partir' instead of 'renvoie-la', to better reflect the disciples' request and improve readability. 4. **Contextual Nuance**: Reinforce the immediate nature of the interaction to enhance understanding of the scene. Overall, the translation is solid, but addressing these points could greatly improve its effectiveness.

The peer review of the translation of MAT 17:26 reveals several key areas for improvement while acknowledging its strengths. Reviewers commend the translation for being generally accurate and faithful to the original Greek text. However, they suggest enhancing clarity and flow in the French phrasing. Recommended improvements include: 1. Rephrasing 'les fils sont-ils exempts d'impôts' for more natural flow, such as 'les fils ne doivent-ils pas payer de l'impôt ?' or 'les fils ne sont-ils pas exemptés de l'impôt ?'. 2.

The peer reviews highlight several actionable corrections for the translation of MAT 23:18: 1. Enhance the nuance of language to better reflect the gravity and sacredness of the altar and offerings (Corrections #1, #2, #3). 2.

The peer review of MAT 27:7 suggests several improvements for the translation. Key recommendations include: 1. **Clarification of Context**: The translation should explain the significance of the field being purchased with blood money, emphasizing its implications related to Judas' betrayal. 2. **Literal Translation Enhancements**: Consider using more literal phrases such as 'pour la sépulture des étrangers' to better reflect the original Greek meaning and intent. 3. **Originality in Expression**: Avoiding close similarities with existing translations to maintain originality and minimize potential copyright issues. 4. **Incorporating Contextual Elements**: Providing a brief explanation or commentary on the spiritual and judgmental significance of the purchase to enrich the reader's understanding. Overall, the translation is solid but can be improved with these adjustments.

1. **Literal Translation Focus**: Maintain strict adherence to a literal translation, avoiding interpretative commentary. The phrase 'soulignant ainsi les conséquences tragiques de la trahison de Judas' should be removed to keep the translation objective and true to the original text. 2. **Clarity and Precision**: Enhance clarity in the final formulation to improve accessibility and comprehension for readers. 3. **Originality and Copyright Considerations**: Ensure that the translation remains original and does not closely resemble existing translations. Avoid language that may lead to confusion regarding the intent of a literal translation. 4. **Potential Contextual Notes**: While no additional commentary should be included in the translation itself, consider the option of a footnote to explain the spiritual significance of Judas' actions if applicable. Overall, the translation is good but requires refinement to align better with these objectives.

Working on verse MAT 6:5 which has grade 87.5

The peer review of the translation of MAT 6:5 suggests several actionable corrections: 1. **Clarity and Natural Flow**: Revise certain phrases to avoid clichés and enhance clarity for modern readers, ensuring that the translation sounds natural in spoken French. 2. **Terminology**: Use more commonly understood terms for 'hypocrites' to improve accessibility. 3. **Contextual Nuance**: Adjust the phrase 'ils ont reçu leur récompense' to reflect a deeper spiritual context, indicating a loss of greater spiritual rewards rather than just a transactional meaning. 4. **Engagement with Religious Context**: Elevate the language to better reflect the religious and ethical nuances of the Sermon on the Mount, ensuring the spiritual impact of the verse is communicated effectively. 5. **Formality of Tone**: Adopt a slightly more formal tone to align with the biblical context, maintaining respect for the source material. Overall, the translation is strong but could benefit from these refinements.

Working on verse MAT 10:19 which has grade 87.5

The peer reviews indicate that while the translation of Matthew 10:19 is generally accurate and faithful to the original text, several areas for improvement have been identified. Specifically, reviewers recommend simplifying redundant phrases for clarity, such as replacing 'la manière dont vous parlerez ni de ce que vous direz' with a more straightforward option like 'comment vous parlerez'. Additionally, enhancing the flow and readability of sentences, particularly 'ce qui vous sera donné à cette heure-là', to 'ce qui vous sera donné en ce moment', could improve the translation's effectiveness. Overall, the translation meets the objective but requires minor adjustments for greater conciseness and precision.

Working on verse MAT 26:23 which has grade 87.5

1. **Clarity and Readability**: Several comments suggest that the phrasing 'celui qui a plongé sa main avec moi dans le plat' could be improved for better fluency in French. Consider rephrasing to something like 'celui qui a mis sa main dans le plat avec moi' for a more natural expression.  
2. **Linguistic Refinement**: Maintain the literal translation approach, but ensure the terminology aligns consistently across the text. This will help avoid ambiguity and enhance understanding, especially for audiences unfamiliar with biblical language.  
3. **Theological Emphasis**: While the essence of betrayal is captured, further emphasis on the gravity of the betrayal could be beneficial. Expanding slightly on the implications may strengthen the theological impact of the translation.  
4. **Terminology Consistency**: Address the term 'τυρίβλιον' by potentially specifying it as a 'dish' or 'bowl' for clarity, enhancing the translation's accuracy while keeping the literal structure.  
Overall, a solid translation with minor adjustments for clarity, theological depth, and consistency will elevate the final output.

Working on verse MAT 27:66 which has grade 87.5

The translation of MAT 27:66 is generally accurate, retaining the essence of the original Greek text. However, reviewers noted the following areas for improvement: 1. The term 'sécuriser' could be replaced with 'assurer' or 'protéger' to better reflect the solemnity and context of the act. 2. Clarifying the phrase 'sceau' to convey its meaning as a formal sealing action would enhance understanding. 3. The phrase 'avec la garde' may be refined for improved clarity and readability. Overall, the translation is solid, but minor adjustments in terminology and phrasing could strengthen its clarity and adherence to the original text.

4. **Literal Fidelity**: Maintain a balance between literal translation and clarity, ensuring that the nuances of the original Greek text are fully captured while respecting the theological context.

The peer review of MAT 26:41 reveals several areas for improvement in the translation. The consensus highlights that the translation is generally accurate and effectively captures the essence of the original Greek text.

1. **Phrasing Improvement**: Consider revising 'effectivement arrivé parmi vous' to a more literal and direct phrasing, such as 'est arrivé parmi vous' or 'est venu sur vous' to enhance fidelity to the original text.

1. **Word Choice Re-evaluation**: The term 'incrédulité' may be better than 'méfiance' to accurately reflect the original Greek term for unbelief. Ensure the terminology aligns with traditional interpretations.  
2. **Phrasing Clarity**: Simplify or clarify phrases like 'et rien ne vous sera impossible', ensuring that they directly convey the original message without extra paraphrasing. It may be beneficial to specify that the promise pertains to faith.  
3. **Fluency and Naturalness**: Review the sentence structures for fluidity and coherence in French, particularly in the phrasing about commanding the mountain to move. Adjustments may be necessary for modern French usage.  
4. **Emphasis on Faith's Role**: Reiterate the significance of faith as a condition for divine action, making sure it’s clear that the context of the impossibility pertains to faith itself.  
5. **Overall Fidelity**: Keep the translation faithful to the original Greek, avoiding any previous word choices or phrasing that diluted the meaning. Aim for a more formal and respectful tone that aligns with conservative Christian viewpoints.

Working on verse MAT 28:13 which has grade 88.0

The peer review comments on MAT 28:13 highlight several areas for improvement in the translation: 

1. **Clarity and Fluidity**: Reviewers suggest enhancing the overall fluidity of the phrase 'ont volé' to convey a more precise meaning. Consider using 'ont emporté son corps' to clarify that it is specifically the body being referenced rather than a general theft. 

2. **Nuance of Deception**: It is recommended to capture the nuance of deliberate deception rather than just theft. Emphasizing the intent behind the actions of the disciples can strengthen the theological context. 

3. **Vocabulary Choices**: While the current wording is largely accurate, using terms that better reflect the theological implications of the passage could enhance understanding, particularly regarding the significance of the resurrection. 

Overall, the translation is strong and adheres well to the literal translation objectives, but minor adjustments in phrasing and vocabulary could greatly improve clarity and theological fidelity.

old: Et ils dirent: Dites que ses disciples sont venus pendant la nuit et l'ont volé pendant que nous dormions.
new: Et ils dirent : Dites que ses disciples sont venus pendant la nuit et ont emporté son corps pendant que nous dormions.

new: Il a été dit : ‘Celui qui renvoie sa femme, qu'il lui donne un certificat de divorce’, un document qui légalise la séparation et souligne les conséquences sociales et juridiques du divorce. À l'époque, le certificat était nécessaire selon les pratiques juives pour assurer que la femme ne soit pas considérée comme une adultère, protégeant ainsi la dignité de l'individu. Toutefois, du point de vue chrétien, le divorce est perçu comme une rupture grave du lien sacré du mariage, ce qui reflète la profonde valeur accordée à cette institution divine.

1. **Stick to Literal Translation**: Ensure the translation is strictly literal and avoids interpretative commentary. 
2. **Reduce Excessive Commentary**: Remove or minimize any explanations or context that stray from the text to enhance adherence to translation directives. 
3. **Maintain Clarity and Formal Tone**: Keep the phrasing formal and clear, consistent with traditional translations, without adding additional layers of interpretation. 
4. **Refine Focus on Source Text**: Concentrate on delivering a faithful rendering of the source text, focusing solely on the translation without additional implications or insights.

old: Il a été dit : ‘Celui qui renvoie sa femme, qu'il lui donne un certificat de divorce’, un document qui légalise la séparation et souligne les conséquences sociales et juridiques du divorce. À l'époque, le certificat était nécessaire selon les pratiques juives pour assurer que la femme ne soit pas considérée comme une adultère, protégeant ainsi la dignité de l'individu. Toutefois, du point de vue chrétien, le divorce est perçu comme une rupture grave du lien sacré du mariage, ce qui reflète la profonde valeur accordée à cette institution divine.

Working on verse MAT 6:4 which has grade 88.33333333333333

1. **Terminology Adjustment**: Consider using 'aumône' instead of 'charité' to more accurately reflect the biblical concept of almsgiving and avoid ambiguity, as 'charité' may imply a broader notion of benevolence. 

2. **Literal Accuracy**: Enhance the translation's fidelity by using a more literal approach to key terms, especially 'ἀποδώσει' (will reward), to ensure it conveys the divine acknowledgment of acts in a manner true to the original text. 

3. **Phrasing Improvement**: Refine the expression 'te le rendra en public' to better emphasize divine recognition rather than merely public reward. Suggested alternatives could enhance the flow and clarity of the translation in French.

4. **Contemporary Language**: For improved readability and modern expression, consider terms like 'ta générosité' as substitutes for 'ta charité.'

5. **Maintain Faithfulness**: Ensure the translation reflects the conservative Christian viewpoint, focusing on the sincerity of giving without seeking human recognition, while avoiding close parallels with existing translations to maintain originality.

old: Ainsi, ta charité se fera dans le secret; et ton Père qui voit dans le secret te le rendra en public.
new: Ainsi, ta générosité se fera dans le secret; et ton Père qui voit dans le secret te récompensera de manière visible.

1. **Maintain Literal Accuracy**: The current translation captures the original Greek well, but minor adjustments can enhance its flow and resonance with conservative audiences.  
2. **Consider Traditional Wording**: Replace 'parfume' with 'oint' to align with more traditional Bible translations, which may better convey the cultural and religious significance of the action.

4. **Enhance Formality**: Use slightly more formal language to communicate reverence, consistent with conservative Christian perspectives.  
5. **Avoid Plagiarism**: Ensure the translation structure is original while retaining faithfulness to the source text.

Working on verse MAT 9:27 which has grade 88.33333333333333

The translation of MAT 9:27 is generally accurate, effectively conveying the original Greek text's meaning and the urgency of the blind men's plea for mercy. However, several corrections suggest enhancing clarity, improving the readability for modern audiences, and ensuring the tone reflects the desperation and faith of the characters. Additionally, it is recommended to emphasize the theological significance of the term 'Fils de David' to resonate better with a conservative Christian audience. Overall, minor adjustments in phrasing and attention to stylistic consistency across translations are advised.

old: Et en passant de là, deux aveugles le suivirent, en criant et disant : Aie pitié de nous, Fils de David.
new: Et en passant par là, deux aveugles le suivirent, en criant : "Aie pitié de nous, Fils de David !"

Avoid overly passive constructions like 'fermé leurs yeux' to reflect active resistance. Consider 'ils ont entendu avec des oreilles lourdes' for clarity on spiritual blindness.

2. **Fidelity to Original Text**: Ensure that the translation captures the original Greek tense and intent accurately. For instance, adjust 'je les guérirai' to reflect the Greek context appropriately.

3. **Theological Precision**: Revise phrases like 'pour que je les guérisse' to clarify that healing implies a spiritual transformation rather than just physical recovery. Emphasize repentance by rephrasing 'se retournent vers moi' if necessary.

4. **Sentence Structure Improvements**: Simplify and break down complex sentences to enhance readability. Aim for a natural flow that retains the essence of the message while avoiding modern interpretations that stray from the original.

5. **Commentary Consideration**: While peer feedback suggests adding contextual commentary, this may detract from the primary focus of the translation. It may be beneficial to note for future consideration but should not be included in the immediate revisions.

1. **Clarity and Fidelity**: The translation is largely clear and faithful to the original Greek text. Most reviewers commend the overall accuracy of the meaning conveyed.

2. **Word Choice**: There is a suggestion to enhance clarity by revising phrases such as 'Il lui fit le serment' to be more direct or traditional, like 'Il prêta serment de lui accorder'. This could better align with the formal tone of biblical language.

3. **Fluidity and Style**: While maintaining a literal translation is essential, improving the fluidity and natural flow of the French could enhance readability. Incorporating more traditional phrasing could lend a greater sense of reverence.

4. **Terminology Consistency**: Ensuring consistent terminology throughout the translation could aid in clarity and coherence, strengthening the reader's understanding of the text.

5. **Contextual Reflection**: Some reviewers suggest adding a deeper reflection on the implications of the oath for additional context, enriching the translation's impact.

Overall, the translation is strong but could benefit from adjustments in word choice, style, and context for a more polished and biblically faithful rendering.

Working on verse MAT 16:2 which has grade 87.66666666666667

1. **Improve Fluency**: Consider rephrasing expressions like 'À la tombée de la nuit' to something more natural, such as 'au soir' or 'en soirée'. The expression 'Il fait beau' could be revised to a more idiomatic phrase like 'vous dites qu'il va faire beau'.

Working on verse MAT 16:2 which has grade 85.0

1. **Phrasing Adjustments**: Reformulate 'vous dites qu'il va faire beau' to a more direct translation like 'vous dites : Il fera beau' to align more closely with the Greek text's intent. 

2. **Visual Description**: Change 'le ciel prend une teinte rougeâtre' to 'le ciel est rouge' or 'le ciel devient rouge' for a clearer and more straightforward visual representation. 

3. **Enhancing Formality**: Maintain a formal tone throughout the translation. Consider using 'À la tombée de la nuit' or 'en soirée' for consistency and reverence in biblical language.

Working on verse MAT 18:30 which has grade 88.33333333333333

The peer review of MAT 18:30 emphasizes the accuracy and faithfulness of the translation to the original Greek text. Several reviewers noted that while the translation is generally clear and captures the essence of the source, there are opportunities for stylistic improvements to enhance fluidity and formality. Specific suggestions include considering a more literal phrasing such as 'jusqu'à ce qu'il remette ce qu'il devait' instead of the current 'jusqu'à ce qu'il ait payé ce qu'il devait.' Overall, while the translation is commendable, addressing these minor points could further align it with both the original text and the conservative Christian viewpoint on forgiveness.

Working on verse MAT 20:6 which has grade 88.33333333333333

The peer review of the translation of MAT 20:6 offers several actionable corrections: 1. **Phrasing Improvement**: Consider rephrasing 'Pourquoi êtes-vous restés ici toute la journée sans rien faire?' to a more natural-sounding French, such as 'Pourquoi restez-vous ici, inoccupés, toute la journée ?' to enhance fluency. 2. **Contextual Clarity**: Suggest including additional words to emphasize inaction, such as 'travail,' which would highlight the urgency and desperation of the workers, thus reflecting the tone of the original text more effectively. 3. **Minor Stylistic Enhancements**: Focus on refining word choice to improve the natural flow while adhering to the literal translation requirement, ensuring the translation remains clear and accessible to a conservative Christian audience. Overall, the translation is solid but has room for these nuanced improvements.

old: À la onzième heure, il sortit et trouva d'autres qui étaient là, debout, et leur dit: Pourquoi êtes-vous restés ici toute la journée sans rien faire?

The translation of MAT 20:8 is generally accurate and captures the essence of the original Greek text. However, several areas for improvement were noted: 1. Enhance the formality of language to better suit a conservative Christian audience. 2. Consider using more polished expressions such as 'verser leur salaire' instead of 'donne-leur' for clarity. 3. Adjust phrases like 'en commençant par' to a more formal structure, e.g., 'en commençant par ceux qui sont venus en dernier.' 4. Improve the fluency and natural flow of the translation for better reader engagement. Overall, while the translation is commendable, addressing these suggestions would refine its clarity and biblical tone.

2. **Phrasing Adjustments**: Consider using 'dormez' instead of 'reposez-vous' for a more direct translation of 'καθεύδετε'. The term 'remis aux mains des pécheurs' may be better stated as 'remis entre les mains des pécheurs' for clarity.

1. **Translation Accuracy**: Aim for a more literal translation. Instead of 'l'un de ceux qui étaient avec Jésus', consider using 'l'un de ses compagnons'. Similarly, 'l'oreille' could be specified as 'son oreille' for clarity.

2. **Word Choice Improvements**: Use 'drew his sword' instead of 'tira son épée' to closely match the original Greek. Additionally, 'coupant son oreille' may be clearer than 'lui enlevant l'oreille' to emphasize the action.

3. **Consistency with Biblical Language**: Consider using 'esclave' instead of 'serviteur' for a deeper understanding of the servant's position, and ensure traditional biblical language is used for a conservative Christian audience.

4. **Flow and Clarity**: Review the grammatical structure to enhance clarity. Phrases like 'de ses mains' instead of 'de ses bras' can improve the flow while maintaining fidelity to the original text. 

Overall, while the translation is commendable, focusing on these areas will refine the quality and clarity of the final product.

old: Et il ne lui répondit même pas un mot, ce qui étonna énormément le préfet.\n\n*Note : Le silence de Jésus, loin d'être une faiblesse, représente une affirmation profonde de sa mission divine et de sa confiance inébranlable dans la souveraineté de Dieu. Dans ce moment de calme, il démontre une foi totale face à l'injustice, renforçant ainsi la portée salvatrice de son sacrifice, essentiel dans le plan de rédemption.

The peer review of MAT 28:16 highlights several strengths and areas for improvement in the translation. Overall, the translation is considered accurate and faithful to the original Greek text, with a suitable choice of words like 'montagne' and phrases that reflect the original intent. Suggested improvements include: 1) Enhance clarity and fluidity of the text by re-evaluating phrases like 's'en allèrent'—consider alternatives like 'se rendirent'. 2) Improve stylistic elements to make the translation more formal and refined, such as potentially using 'décidée' instead of 'désignée' to convey the sense of Jesus’ command more effectively. 3) Maintain the balance between literal fidelity and readability for a French-speaking audience.

Working on verse MAT 10:1 which has grade 88.66666666666667

The peer review of MAT 10:1 reveals several strengths in the student's translation, particularly its fidelity to the original Greek text and its clarity in conveying the authority Jesus gives to His disciples. Key strengths include:
1. Accurate terminology and phrasing that reflect the intent of the source text.
2. Overall clarity and understanding of the Greek text.
3. Avoidance of plagiarism and a solid adherence to the literal translation objective.

However, reviewers also identified areas for improvement:
1. Enhance fluidity and style in the French translation to make it read more naturally.
2. More explicitly emphasize the spiritual authority conveyed in the passage, possibly by substituting 'pouvoir' with 'autorité' to better reflect the Greek term 'ἐξουσίαν.'
3. Consider a closer adherence to the structure and nuance of the original Greek for improved clarity.
4. Add precision regarding the nature of the mission assigned to the disciples for greater impact.

In conclusion, the translation is strong overall but would benefit from slight adjustments in word choice, style, and emphasis to achieve excellence.

Working on verse MAT 16:23 which has grade 88.66666666666667

The peer review of MAT 16:23 highlights several key areas for improvement in the translation: 1. **Theological Clarity**: The term 'Satan' is correctly used, but further emphasis on its significance as a personal adversary would enhance the translation's theological implications. 2. **Metaphorical Interpretation**: The phrase 'pierre d'achoppement' is generally effective, but consider rephrasing to 'obstacle' or providing a more explicit metaphorical context to aid reader understanding. 3. **Directness in Language**: The expression 'car tu ne penses pas aux choses de Dieu, mais aux choses des hommes' could benefit from a more direct translation to reflect the Greek structure better. 4. **Contextual Enrichment**: Adding context to emphasize Jesus's warning to Peter and the broader spiritual implications would strengthen the conservative interpretation of the text. 5. **Maintaining Accessibility**: Ensure that the translation remains clear and accessible, avoiding overly complex language while enhancing the doctrinal significance. Overall, the translation is strong but could be refined for greater theological fidelity and clarity.

Working on verse MAT 17:7 which has grade 88.66666666666667

1. **Literal Translation Adjustments**: Consider using 'les a touchés' instead of 'les toucha' for a more faithful rendering of 'ἥψατο' to reflect Jesus' personal action. Additionally, using 'touche' instead of 'les toucha' could emphasize the immediacy of the touch. 

2. **Emphasis on Theological Nuance**: Integrate a clearer emphasis on Jesus' authority and divinity in the translation. Suggestions include modifying the phrasing to something like 'Levez-vous, c'est moi qui vous dis de ne pas avoir peur.' This would highlight His comforting presence and divine command. 

3. **Reassurance Context**: Add a brief note on the significance of Jesus' reassurance within the context of His divinity and the disciples' fear to deepen the understanding of the passage. 

4. **Overall Review**: While the translation is well-received, these minor adjustments could enhance the literalness and theological depth, ensuring a more robust understanding of the text.

Working on verse MAT 18:18 which has grade 88.66666666666667

The translation of Matthew 18:18 is generally accurate and captures the theological significance of the binding and loosing concepts. However, the following improvements are recommended: 1. Replace 'délirez' with 'déliez' or 'délié' for consistency and clarity, as 'délirez' may confuse readers. 2. Consider rephrasing the translation for a more natural and formal flow in French, aligning it with traditional interpretations. 3. Ensure that the structure maintains the gravity associated with biblical texts while preserving the literal meaning of the original Greek.

old: En vérité, je vous le dis, tout ce que vous lierez sur la terre sera lié dans le ciel, et tout ce que vous délirez sur la terre sera délié dans le ciel.
new: En vérité, je vous le dis, tout ce que vous lierez sur la terre sera lié dans le ciel, et tout ce que vous déliez sur la terre sera délié dans le ciel.

Working on verse MAT 21:35 which has grade 88.33333333333333

1. **Accuracy and Fidelity**: Ensure that the translation closely aligns with the original Greek text, especially in terminology describing the actions of the servants (e.g., use 'frappé' for 'beaten', 'tué' for 'killed', and 'lapidé' for 'stoned'). Consider emphasizing the violence more explicitly in the translation.  

2. **Clarity and Fluency**: Revise the phrasing for better fluidity and readability in French. Suggestions include using parallel structure in verbs (e.g., 'l'un fut frappé, l'autre fut tué, et le dernier fut lapidé') to clearly indicate the sequence of actions without ambiguity.  

3. **Terminology**: While 'cultivateurs de la vigne' is correct, consider using 'servants' or 'vignerons' to maintain consistency with the original text and avoid overly technical language. This adjustment could make the translation more accessible.  

4. **Overall Style**: Aim for a more traditional biblical language in the French translation for stylistic consistency while enhancing clarity. Additionally, adding footnotes for deeper theological insights could improve understanding without changing the text itself.

4. **Stylistic Enhancements**: Aim for minor stylistic adjustments for a more formal or biblical tone. For example, replacing 'en plaçant un sceau' with 'en scellant' could better match biblical language.

5. **General Refinements**: Overall, focus on enhancing readability while preserving the original meaning. Maintain a balance between being literal and ensuring the translation is fluid and respectful of the original text's integrity.

Use simpler terms such as 'sceau' instead of 'sceau officiel' to avoid modern connotations. \n2. **Phrasing Enhancements**: Revise 'avec les gardes' to 'sous la surveillance des gardes' or 'en compagnie des gardes' to emphasize the role of the guards. Explore rephrasing constructions for improved flow, like 'en scellant la pierre, avec les gardes'. \n3. **Maintain Literal Fidelity**: Ensure the translation closely follows the Greek syntax and meaning, considering the original term 'ἠσφαλίσαντο' as possibly aligning better with 'sécurisèrent'. \n4. **Stylistic Improvements**: Use terms that reflect biblical language better, such as 'scellant' instead of 'en plaçant un sceau', while ensuring fluidity in the French. \n5. **Overall Readability**: Ensure that the final translation remains clear, direct, and respectful of the original text's integrity while avoiding unnecessary modern interpretations.

The peer reviews for MAT 5:2 commend the translation as faithful and literal, effectively capturing the essence of the original Greek text.

Working on verse MAT 11:12 which has grade 88.83333333333333

The peer review indicates that while the translation of Matthew 11:12 is generally accurate and captures the original Greek meaning well, it can be improved by: 1) Enhancing clarity and fluidity, especially in conveying the concept of 'violence' or 'force' as seen in the original terms. 2) Considering alternative phrasings for 's'en emparent' to better reflect the sense of being 'forcefully taken'. 3) Maintaining fidelity to the conservative Christian theological perspective in the language used. Overall, slight adjustments to wording and phrasing could lead to a more nuanced and contextually rich translation.

old: Depuis les jours de Jean-Baptiste jusqu'à maintenant, le royaume des cieux est soumis à des efforts, et ceux qui font des efforts s'en emparent.
new: Depuis les jours de Jean-Baptiste jusqu'à présent, le royaume des cieux est violemment avancé, et ceux qui s'efforcent de le saisir le prennent par la force.

The peer review of Matthew 11:12 provides several actionable suggestions for enhancing the translation: 1) Improve clarity by reconsidering phrases such as 'le royaume des cieux est violemment avancé', possibly using alternatives like 'le royaume des cieux progresse avec force' to better capture the urgency of the original text. 2) Adjust the phrase 'ceux qui s'efforcent de le saisir le prennent par la force' for improved fluidity; a suggestion is 'le prennent avec force'. 3) Ensure that vocabulary reflects the intended spiritual and energetic nuance of 'βιάζεται', potentially replacing 'violemment' with terms like 's'efforce' or 'force'. 4) Maintain the unique nature of the translation to avoid plagiarism while keeping fidelity to the original Greek.

Working on verse MAT 16:22 which has grade 88.33333333333333

1. **Emotional Tone Adjustment**: Revise the phrase 'Aie pitié de toi-même' to something more urgent like 'Pitié, Seigneur!' to reflect Peter's concern accurately.  
2. **Literal Fidelity Improvement**: Ensure 'ἵλεώς σοι' is translated directly as 'Pitié, Seigneur' instead of 'Aie pitié de toi-même' to capture the imperative nature of Peter's admonition.  
3. **Phrase Refinement for Clarity**: Instead of 'Que cela ne t'arrive pas', consider 'Que cela ne t'arrivât jamais' for stronger emotional impact.  
4. **Maintain Formality**: Incorporate more traditional and formal expressions where appropriate, such as 'Dieu ne le permette pas' to align with conservative Christian perspectives.  
5. **Avoid Misinterpretations**: Use contemporary language that remains respectful and clear to modern French speakers, ensuring that translations are idiomatic without straying from the original meaning.

Working on verse MAT 21:2 which has grade 88.83333333333333

The peer review of MAT 21:2 indicates that the translation is largely accurate and faithful to the original Greek text, successfully conveying the command given by Jesus. Suggested improvements include: 1) Clarifying that 'poulain' refers specifically to a young donkey or foal, possibly by using 'petit poulain'. 2) Enhancing the phrase 'en face de' instead of 'devant' for 'ἀπέναντι' to maintain literal meaning. 3) Improving fluidity and clarity, particularly in phrases like 'et un poulain avec elle', which could be adjusted to 'et un poulain à côté d'elle'. Overall, the translation is solid but could benefit from these minor adjustments for better readability and precision.

3. **Maintain Parallel Structure**: Ensure that all verbs are consistently structured in the past tense for better readability, such as by uniformly using the form 'fut'.

4. **Literary Style**: Aim for a more traditional biblical style in language to match the context and gravity of the message while also enhancing clarity. Consider adding footnotes for deeper theological insights.

5. **Fluidity and Naturalness**: Enhance the overall flow of the translation, making it more natural in French while ensuring it remains faithful to the original Greek text. 

6. **Overall Fidelity**: Maintain adherence to the literal translation objective without veering towards plagiarism from existing translations, ensuring a clear understanding of the passage.

3. **Clarity of Actions**: Explicitly mention that the vignerons are the ones performing the actions to enhance understanding of the narrative.

4. **Maintain Verb Tense Consistency**: Ensure all verbs are uniformly structured in the past tense for improved readability and clarity.

Working on verse MAT 23:15 which has grade 88.83333333333333

The peer review comments on MAT 23:15 suggest several actionable corrections: 1. Consider rephrasing 'fils de l'enfer' to 'fils de la perdition' or 'enfant de la perdition' to soften the impact while retaining theological meaning. 2. Explore using a more contemporary term for 'prosélyte' to improve resonance with modern readers. 3. Minor adjustments to enhance the literary style and flow of the translation could increase its overall impact. Overall, the translation is well-received but could benefit from these refinements to better connect with contemporary audiences.

old: Malheur à vous, scribes et pharisiens hypocrites ! Vous parcourez la mer et la terre pour faire un seul prosélyte, et quand vous l'avez trouvé, vous en faites un fils de l'enfer deux fois plus que vous.

The peer review of MAT 26:49 presents several constructive observations regarding the translation. Key strengths include: 1) The greeting 'Salut, Rabbi !' effectively conveys the respectful tone of Judas towards Jesus. 2) The translation captures the essence and structure of the original Greek text well. Suggestions for improvement: 1) Consider a more literal rendering of 'κατεφίλησεν αὐτόν' (e.g., 'et lui a donné un baiser') to enhance fidelity. 2) Modify the phrase 'Salut, Rabbi !' to 'Salut, maître !' for a more accurate representation of the honorific. 3) Add nuance to indicate the betrayal context associated with the kiss. 4) Focus on maintaining a formal tone and cultural significance throughout the translation. Overall, while the translation is solid, minor adjustments in word choice and structure are recommended to improve accuracy and depth.

The translation of MAT 28:4 is generally accurate and effectively captures the essence of the original Greek text. Here are the key points of feedback: 1. Maintain literal fidelity: While the translation is good, slight adjustments could enhance literal accuracy, such as changing 'devinrent comme des morts' to 'devinrent comme morts' for a closer alignment with the original text. 2.

Common suggestions for improvement include: 1) Consider using more traditional biblical phrasing for phrases like 'une voix s'est faite entendre à Rama', possibly changing it to 'une voix se fit entendre à Rama'. 2) Enhance emotional and literary richness by exploring varied vocabulary for terms such as 'pleurs' and 'lamentations'. 3) Ensure clarity and readability in the translation while maintaining the emotional weight of the original text. 4) Avoid modern language that could detract from the traditional tone. Overall, the translation is strong, but these adjustments could elevate its quality for a conservative Christian audience.

Working on verse MAT 5:22 which has grade 89.16666666666667

The peer review comments on MAT 5:22 highlight the following actionable corrections for the translation: 1. Consider rephrasing 'sujet au jugement' to emphasize the gravity of the spiritual condition described. 2. Replace 'sans cause' in 'se met en colère contre son frère sans cause' with a more literal representation that directly reflects the Greek term 'ἐν ὀργῇ' (in anger). 3. The terms 'Fou!' and 'Insensé!' could be adjusted to better align with the severity of 'ῥακά' and 'μωρέ'. Using 'insensé' instead of 'Fou!' may improve the formal tone of the translation. 4. Ensure that the overall translation maintains clarity while being faithful to the original meaning.

old: Mais je vous dis que quiconque se met en colère contre son frère sans cause sera sujet au jugement; et quiconque dira à son frère: ‘Fou!’ sera sujet au conseil; et quiconque lui dira: ‘Insensé!’ sera passible de la géhenne de feu.
new: Mais je vous dis que quiconque s'irrite dans la colère contre son frère sera responsable devant le jugement; et quiconque dira à son frère : ‘Insensé !’ sera passible du conseil; et quiconque lui dira : ‘Stupide !’ sera passible de la géhenne de feu.

The peer review of the translation of Matthew 5:25 highlights several areas for improvement while acknowledging the overall accuracy and clarity of the translation. Key suggestions include:
1. **Phrase Adjustments**: Consider rephrasing 'agent de justice' to 'officier de justice' for clearer alignment with conservative interpretations. Also, explore replacing 'adversaire' with 'opposant' for broader understanding.

1. **Phrase Simplification**: Change 'Il la toucha donc la main' to 'Il toucha sa main' to enhance clarity and formality. 2. **Verb Choice**: Consider replacing 'la fièvre l'abandonna' with 'la fièvre la quitta' to maintain a more literal translation reflecting the healing process. 3. **Streamline for Flow**: The word 'donc' could be omitted for a more direct rendering that aligns closer with the Greek text. 4. **Contextual Emphasis**: Strengthen the theological emphasis on service by possibly refining the phrase 'elle se leva et commença à le servir' to reflect the servant nature of her actions towards Jesus. 5. **Formal Tone**: Maintain a consistent formal tone throughout to match the reverence of biblical language.

Working on verse MAT 8:18 which has grade 88.5

The peer review of MAT 8:18 highlights several actionable corrections for improving the translation. Key recommendations include: 1) Use more direct phrases for Jesus' command, such as 'qu'ils partent' or 'qu'ils s'en aillent', to enhance the authoritative tone. 2) Consider rephrasing 'aux foules' to a more singular term or an alternative like 'les multitudes' or 'les gens' for clarity and precision. 3) Simplify sentence structures for better readability, ensuring they feel natural in French. 4) Maintain the original message while adjusting for clarity and flow, avoiding any previous phrasing that could imply a casual suggestion instead of a command. Overall, while the current translation captures the original meaning well, these adjustments can significantly enhance its directness, clarity, and fidelity to the source.

Working on verse MAT 13:18 which has grade 89.16666666666667

The translation of Matthew 13:18 as "Écoutez donc l'explication de la parabole du semeur" is largely accurate, capturing the intended meaning of the original Greek text. Key areas for improvement include: 1. Emphasizing Jesus' authority in the teaching to enhance conservative interpretation. 2. Introducing more literal phrases while maintaining clarity, possibly by specifying 'the explanation of the parable of the sower' rather than just 'the explanation of the parable.' 3. Adding context regarding the importance of listening in relation to the parables. 4. Ensuring alignment with traditional or formal translations preferred in conservative Christian contexts. Overall, the translation is solid but could benefit from slight adjustments for enhanced clarity and theological context.

old: Écoutez donc l'explication de la parabole du semeur.
new: Écoutez donc l'explication de la parabole du semeur, car comprendre ce qu'enseigne Jésus est essentiel.

Working on verse MAT 13:18 which has grade 81.66666666666667

The peer review identified that the student's translation of Matthew 13:18 includes an unnecessary interpretative addition, 'car comprendre ce qu'enseigne Jésus est essentiel,' which is not found in the original Greek text. To improve, the student should focus on a more literal rendering of the verse that captures its essence without added commentary. Corrections emphasized the importance of fidelity to the original scripture, suggesting that a direct translation would enhance the overall quality and adherence to the objective. Therefore, it is recommended to remove the additional phrase and ensure the translation strictly reflects the source material.

The peer reviews of MAT 15:33 highlight the overall strength and clarity of the translation, noting its fidelity to the original Greek text. However, several reviewers suggest that the translation could be enriched by emphasizing the desperation and urgency of the disciples' situation in the desert.

Working on verse MAT 18:30 which has grade 89.16666666666667

The peer review of MAT 18:30 highlights several opportunities for improving the translation while maintaining its fidelity to the original Greek text. Key recommendations include:

1. Consider using 'jusqu'à ce qu'il rembourse ce qu'il devait' instead of 'jusqu'à ce qu'il remette ce qu'il devait' to reflect the financial context more accurately.
2. Adjust phrasing for clarity and fluidity, such as 'il ne voulut pas, mais s'en alla, et le mit en prison...' to emphasize the servant's refusal and the consequence of his actions.
3. Substitute 'mettre en prison' with 'enfermer' to better convey the severity of imprisonment.
4. While 'remette' is adequate, using 'paie' could align the translation more closely with the original text's intent.

Overall, the translation is commendable but could benefit from these minor adjustments to enhance its effectiveness, especially from a conservative Christian perspective.

old: Mais il ne voulut pas, et s'en allant, il le mit en prison jusqu'à ce qu'il remette ce qu'il devait.
new: Mais il ne voulut pas, et s'en allant, il l'enferma jusqu'à ce qu'il rembourse ce qu'il devait.

Working on verse MAT 20:20 which has grade 89.16666666666667

1. **Accuracy and Faithfulness**: The translation is generally accurate and stays faithful to the source text. However, there is a consensus that the phrase 'se prosternant' may need reconsideration to enhance clarity and better convey the intended meaning of deep respect and worship. Suggestions include using alternatives like 's'inclinent' to resonate more with modern audiences while maintaining the essence of the original text.

2. **Fluency and Readability**: Reviewers noted that while the translation is clear, there are minor areas for improvement in the fluidity and naturalness of the language. Enhancing the phrasing could improve the overall readability and ensure that it feels more accessible to contemporary readers. Attention should be given to how actions are described to enhance clarity and impact.

3. **Tone and Context**: It's important to ensure the translation reflects the reverent tone appropriate for a biblical text. Suggestions include using a slightly more formal structure to convey the sacredness of the scripture and adding contextual explanations where needed to reinforce understanding of acts like worship and submission. 

Overall, the student demonstrates a solid understanding of both the source material and translation objectives, but should focus on refining the translation's fluidity, modern resonance, and respectful tone.

old: Alors, la mère des fils de Zébédée s'approcha de lui avec ses fils, se prosternant et lui demandant quelque chose.
new: Alors, la mère des fils de Zébédée s'approcha de lui avec ses fils, s'inclinant et lui demandant quelque chose.

Working on verse MAT 21:18 which has grade 89.16666666666667

The peer review comments for MAT 21:18 suggest several actionable corrections to improve the translation. First, consider using 'Au matin' instead of 'Le matin' for enhanced fluidity. Additionally, simplify 'en retournant à la ville' to 'en entrant dans la ville' or 'en revenant à la ville' for clarity and to better reflect the original intent. Emphasize the immediacy of the morning context in relation to Jesus' actions, perhaps by rephrasing slightly. Maintain the phrase 'Jésus eut faim,' as it accurately conveys Jesus' hunger, but consider variations like 'Jésus ressentit la faim' for stylistic enhancement. Footnotes or contextual clarifications for terms like 'Jésus' or 'la ville' are also recommended to align with conservative Christian interpretations and to enrich understanding of the passage.

old: Le matin, en retournant à la ville, Jésus eut faim.
new: Au matin, en entrant dans la ville, Jésus ressentit la faim.

5. **Terminology Precision**: Aim for precise terminology to strengthen authenticity, ensuring the translation captures the essence and nuances of the original Greek text.

Working on verse MAT 21:32 which has grade 89.16666666666667

The peer review of MAT 21:32 highlights several key points for improvement and commendation:
1. **Clarity and Fluidity**: The phrase 'vous ne vous êtes pas repentis pour croire en lui' could be rephrased for smoother readability and flow in French.
2. **Emphasis on Repentance**: The translation could better emphasize the consequences of disbelief, particularly the need for repentance, as critical from a conservative Christian perspective.
3. **Faithfulness to Original Text**: While the translation is generally faithful to the Greek text, some reviewers noted the need for slightly more literal interpretations in certain phrases to reflect the original structure.
4. **Avoidance of Plagiarism**: The translation is commendable for avoiding plagiarism and maintaining originality.

Overall, the translation is effective but would benefit from minor adjustments to enhance clarity and emphasize theological implications.

Working on verse MAT 22:8 which has grade 89.16666666666667

The peer review of MAT 22:8 highlights several areas for improvement in the current translation: 1. The phrase 'ne le méritaient pas' is criticized for being less direct than a more literal alternative, 'n'étaient pas dignes,' which aligns better with the original Greek meaning of unworthiness. 2. The translations successfully convey the overall message but suggest that slight adjustments in phrasing could enhance fidelity to the original text's intent. 3. While the translation is deemed clear and maintains a good understanding of context, a shift to more precise language regarding worthiness would strengthen its conservative Christian perspective.

old: Alors il dit à ses serviteurs: Le festin est prêt, mais ceux qui étaient invités ne le méritaient pas.
new: Alors il dit à ses serviteurs : Le festin est prêt, mais ceux qui étaient invités n'étaient pas dignes.

The peer review of MAT 22:8 identified several key areas for improvement in the translation: 1. **Terminology**: Consider replacing 'festin' with 'banquet' for better alignment with liturgical language in conservative Christian contexts. 2. **Nuanced Vocabulary**: The phrase 'n'étaient pas dignes' could be enhanced to a more formal or scriptural expression, such as 'n'étaient pas jugés dignes', to emphasize the moral implications of worthiness. 3. **Clarity and Formality**: Aim for slight refinements in wording to maintain clarity while adhering to a formal tone that resonates with traditional biblical language. Overall, the translation is praised for its accuracy and adherence to the original text, with recommendations focusing on enhancing the depth and appropriateness of specific terms.

Working on verse MAT 22:24 which has grade 89.16666666666667

The peer review comments on MAT 22:24 highlight several key points for improvement: 1. Maintain Faithfulness: Ensure the translation captures the literal meaning and nuances of the original Greek text. Consider using more direct phrasing in certain areas to reflect the original structure more accurately. 2. Enhance Clarity: While the translation is generally clear, rephrasing certain terms (like 'susciter une postérité') to more natural constructions (e.g., 'prodiguer une descendance') can improve flow and understanding in French. 3. Cultural Context: Emphasize the cultural significance of terms related to Jewish customs (e.g., the act of 'épouser' could also be represented as 'prendre en mariage' for more authenticity). 4. Avoid Plagiarism: Ensure that the translation is original and does not closely mimic existing translations, while also making the text comprehensible for a conservative Christian audience. Overall, the translation is strong, but these adjustments could enhance its quality.

Working on verse MAT 26:39 which has grade 89.16666666666667

The translation of MAT 26:39 is largely accurate and effectively captures the essence of the original text, but several minor adjustments are recommended: 1. Consider revising 'que cette coupe passe loin de moi' to 's'éloigne de moi' or 'que ce calice s'éloigne de moi' for clarity and fidelity to the original Greek word 'ποτήριον.' 2. Ensure consistent phrasing for key theological terms to enhance clarity and coherence, particularly in expressing submission to God's will. 3. The phrase 'tombé sur son visage' may be misleading; a more accurate rendering should reflect the act of falling prostrate. Overall, while the translation demonstrates strong understanding and effort, these adjustments can improve clarity, precision, and adherence to conservative biblical interpretation standards.

old: Et s'éloignant un peu, il tomba sur son visage, priant et disant : Mon Père, si cela est possible, que cette coupe passe loin de moi; cependant, non pas comme je veux, mais comme tu veux.
new: Et s'éloignant un peu, il tomba prostré sur son visage, priant et disant : Mon Père, si cela est possible, que ce calice s'éloigne de moi; cependant, non pas comme je veux, mais comme tu veux.

The translation of Matthew 26:46, 'Éveillez-vous, allons! Voici, celui qui me trahit est proche,' is generally well-received but requires minor adjustments for improved accuracy and tone. Key suggestions include: 1. Consider changing 'Éveillez-vous' to 'Réveillez-vous' for a more traditional tone. 2. Rephrase 'allons!' to 'allons-nous!' for closer adherence to the original command form in Greek. 3. Substitute 'celui qui me trahit' with 'celui qui me livre' to avoid contemporary connotations of betrayal. 4. Enhance the emotional nuance of the translation to better reflect the gravity of the moment without sacrificing literal accuracy. Overall, the translation effectively captures the essence of the original text with room for slight refinements.

The peer review of the translation of Matthew 26:52 suggests several actionable improvements: 1. **Phrasing Adjustments**: Consider rephrasing 'Remets ton épée à sa place' to a more literal alternative like 'Remballe ton épée' for urgency, while also evaluating 'à sa place' for potential refinement to 'dans son endroit' for better fluidity. 2. **Maintain Consistency**: Ensure verb tense consistency throughout the translation for a more coherent reading. 3. **Improve Natural Flow**: Enhance the overall naturalness of the French language used in the translation for better readability, particularly in phrases like 'périront par l'épée'. 4. **Literal Structure**: Strive for a translation that more closely aligns with the Greek syntax, particularly in preserving the urgency and metaphorical significance of Jesus' message. Overall, aim for a balance between literalness and clarity.

old: Alors Jésus lui dit: Remets ton épée à sa place, car tous ceux qui prennent l'épée périront par l'épée.
new: Alors Jésus lui dit : 'Remballe ton épée dans son endroit, car tous ceux qui prennent l'épée mourront par l'épée.'

Working on verse MAT 26:58 which has grade 89.16666666666667

The peer reviews highlight several key areas for improving the translation of MAT 26:58. First, the introduction of 'Mais Pierre' should be changed to just 'Pierre' to enhance directness. The phrase 'pour voir la fin' could be revised to 'pour voir l'issue de tout cela' or 'pour voir l'issue' to clarify the gravity of the situation. Suggestions to maintain a more literal translation also include using terms that reflect the original Greek, like replacing 'fin' with 'issue' or 'conclusion'. Overall, while the translation is commendable, it can be refined by adopting more precise language and addressing emotional context.

old: Mais Pierre le suivait de loin, jusqu'à la cour du souverain sacrificateur. Et, étant entré, il s'assit parmi les serviteurs pour voir la fin.
new: Pierre le suivait de loin, jusqu'à la cour du souverain sacrificateur. Et, étant entré, il s'assit parmi les serviteurs pour voir l'issue de tout cela.

Working on verse MAT 27:28 which has grade 89.16666666666667

The translation of MAT 27:28 is generally accurate and faithful to the original Greek text. Key strengths include the clear conveyance of meaning, avoidance of plagiarism, and appropriate terminology, such as 'dépouillé' and 'chlamyde écarlate.' However, several reviewers noted areas for improvement: 1) Emphasize the humiliation Jesus endured to align with conservative Christian perspectives. 2) Consider using more solemn language to reflect the context better. 3) Improve the connection to surrounding verses for enhanced understanding. 4) Avoid any tendency toward paraphrase, such as using more traditional terms for 'chlamyde.' 5) Adopt more literal phrasing, like 'ils lui ôtèrent ses vêtements,' to adhere closely to the Greek structure. Implementing these suggestions could improve the translation's impact while maintaining its accuracy.

old: Et ils l'ont dépouillé de ses vêtements et lui ont mis une chlamyde écarlate.
new: Alors ils lui ôtèrent ses vêtements et lui mirent une chlamyde écarlate.

The peer reviews indicate that the translation of Matthew 6:29 is generally strong, effectively conveying the original meaning and maintaining fidelity to the source text. However, several reviewers suggested actionable improvements: 1) Enhance clarity regarding references to the lilies to avoid ambiguity for readers unfamiliar with the context. 2) Consider a more formal tone and deeper engagement with the cultural context of the verse. 3) Aim for more literal adherence to specific Greek phrases to preserve nuances. 4) Refine phrasing to improve resonance with contemporary readers while remaining true to the original message. Overall, the translation is solid but could be elevated with these minor adjustments.
