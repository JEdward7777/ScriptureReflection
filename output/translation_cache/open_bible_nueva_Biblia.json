The phrase \"den su bendición a los que allí viven\" (give your blessing to those who live there) could benefit from more direct translations like \"saluden\" (greet) or \"digan paz\" (say peace) to better reflect the intention of greeting with peace, as emphasized in the original verse (εἰρήνη, peace).

However, there are several important considerations. While the phrase \"que no se demoraran\" conveys a sense of urgency, it may come off as too casual and could be strengthened with a more direct expression like \"vengan pronto\" to reflect the immediate nature of the invitation.

However, there are several important considerations. While the phrase \"que no se demoraran\" (that they should not delay) conveys a sense of urgency, it may come off as too casual and could be strengthened with a more direct expression like \"vengan pronto\" (come quickly) to reflect the immediate nature of the invitation. Additionally, the use of the term \"asados\" (roasted meat) might be perceived as informal and may detract from the reverence typically associated with biblical texts.

Phrases like 'que sanara a un sirviente que estaba en cama paralítico y que sufría mucho' convey the situation clearly and are accessible for modern Spanish audiences. However, there are several areas for improvement:  \n1. The term 'sirviente' might not fully encompass the original Greek term 'παῖς' (pais), which carries connotations of a closer or more intimate relationship, possibly suggesting a son or loved one. Using 'mi niño' (my child) or 'mi siervo' (my servant) could add emotional depth.  \n2. The phrase 'que sanara' may imply past action rather than the immediacy of a request. A direct phrasing like 'que cure a mi siervo...' could enhance the urgent tone.  \n3.

(that he may heal a servant who is bedridden, paralyzed, and suffering greatly.)\n\n### Combined Review\nThe translation of Matthew 8:6 generally captures the essential meaning of the original Greek text, reflecting the urgency of the centurion's plea. Phrases like 'que sanara a un sirviente que estaba en cama paralítico y que sufría mucho' (that he may heal a servant who is bedridden, paralyzed, and suffering greatly) convey the situation clearly and are accessible for modern Spanish audiences. However, there are several areas for improvement:  \n1. The term 'sirviente' (servant) might not fully encompass the original Greek term 'παῖς' (pais), which carries connotations of a closer or more intimate relationship, possibly suggesting a son or loved one. Using 'mi niño' (my child) or 'mi siervo' (my servant) could add emotional depth.  \n2. The phrase 'que sanara' (that he may heal) may imply past action rather than the immediacy of a request. A direct phrasing like 'que cure a mi siervo...' (that he may cure my servant...) could enhance the urgent tone.  \n3. While the structure is generally clear, it can be made more fluid, avoiding phrases like 'y que sufría mucho' (and suffering much) to create a more natural flow.  \n\nOverall, while the translation is clear and effective, slight adjustments in terminology and structure would enhance both clarity and the emotional weight of the plea, aligning it more closely with the original intent.",

However, the phrase \"el mundo entero les pertenecerá\" is not an accurate reflection of the original meaning, which emphasizes inheriting \"the earth\" rather than suggesting general ownership of the world. A more appropriate translation would be to use \"heredarán la tierra\" (they shall inherit the earth) to align with traditional scriptural language and ensure theological accuracy.

However, the phrases 'córtatela y échala lejos' may come across as too casual and might not fully encapsulate the seriousness of the warning. While this translation aligns well with the objectives of accessibility and engagement, some reviewers suggest that terms like 'déjala' instead of 'échala lejos' could enhance the reverence and seriousness of the text. Overall, the translation is effective in conveying the core message, yet slight adjustments could improve its alignment with traditional conservative perspectives on the gravity of sin.",

Phrases like 'despidieron a la multitud' appropriately convey the dismissal of the crowd, while 'mala hierba' accurately reflects 'ζιζάνια.' However, the term 'simbolismo de la mala hierba y el trigo' could be simplified to 'la parábola de la cizaña y el trigo' or 'el significado de la mala hierba y el trigo' to enhance clarity and better align with traditional Christian terminology.

The phrase \"¡Dios guarde, Señor!\" captures Peter's concern in a modern context; however, it could potentially confuse readers with its colloquial tone. Suggested alternatives such as \"¡Ten compasión, Señor!\" or \"¡Esto no te sucederá, Señor!\" may better reflect the gravity of Peter's reprimand. Additionally, while the use of \"reprendió\" is acceptable, alternatives like \"llamó la atención\" or simplifying it to \"lo apartó y le dijo\" could enhance the clarity and tone, making it feel more immediate and less formal. Overall, the translation succeeds in maintaining a contemporary style suitable for Latin American audiences while emphasizing Peter's protective instinct over Jesus' future suffering.": "**MAT 16:22**: _(Grade 89.2)_\n\n**Source**:\n> καὶ προσλαβόμενος αὐτὸν ὁ Πέτρος ἤρξατο ἐπιτιμᾶν αὐτῷ λέγων· ἵλεώς σοι, Κύριε· οὐ μὴ ἔσται σοι τοῦτο.

(The Pharisees gathered to plot a way to ensnare Jesus in his own words and make him say something that would compromise him.)\n\n### Combined Review:\nThe translation of MAT 22:15 is generally well-received, scoring an average of 89.3. Reviewers commend its clarity and effectiveness in conveying the original Greek text's essence in modern Spanish, making it suitable for a Latin American audience. The use of terms like 'tramar' (to plot) and 'enredar' (to ensnare) is highlighted as effective in communicating the deceitful intent of the Pharisees. However, some reviewers suggest that 'enredar' may come off as too casual for a biblical context, proposing alternatives such as 'atrapar' (to catch) or 'planear' (to plan) for maintaining seriousness. Furthermore, the phrase 'en sus propias palabras' (in their own words) may mislead the reader about the subject, with suggestions to refine it for clarity on the specific reference to Jesus. While the translation is largely accessible and aligns with conservative Christian interpretations, minor adjustments to word choice and phrasing could enhance its precision and formality.",

The phrase \"No tenemos suficiente aceite para darles\" accurately reflects the intent of the original message, capturing the urgency of the wise virgins' response. However, the directive \"Vayan a la tienda y compren\" simplifies the context somewhat. A more faithful translation might include the nuance of \"vayan más bien a los que venden\" (\"go rather to those who sell\") to better preserve the metaphorical depth of the original.
