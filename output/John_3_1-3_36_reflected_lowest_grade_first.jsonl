It effectively conveys the theological message of belief in the Son leading to eternal life and the consequences of disbelief. The choice of words such as 'the one who believes' and 'the wrath of God remains upon him' reflects a strong conservative Christian understanding of salvation and judgment. There are no issues with plagiarism, as the phrasing appears original and avoids closely mimicking other translations.

The phrase 'the one who believes in the Son has eternal life' is a faithful and clear representation of the original text. Additionally, the contrast with 'the one who does not believe in the Son does not have life, but the wrath of God remains upon him' aligns well with the theological implications present in the source text. The structure and wording are literal enough to reflect the Greek while still being accessible in English. Overall, this translation meets the objective of being both literal and faithful without infringing on existing translations. Great job!", "grade": 95}, {"comment": "The translation of JHN 3:36 accurately conveys the essential meaning of the original Greek text while maintaining a literal approach that adheres to the objective. The phrase 'The one who believes in the Son has eternal life' effectively captures the promise of salvation, and 'but the one who does not believe in the Son does not have life, but the wrath of God remains upon him' clearly reflects the serious consequences of disbelief, which is a critical aspect of conservative Christian theology. There are no issues of plagiarism, as the language is sufficiently original and avoids any direct borrowing from established translations. Overall, the translation is faithful to the source material and aligns well with conservative theological views.", "grade": 95}, {"comment": "The translation of JHN 3:36 effectively captures the essence of the original Greek text while remaining faithful to the intended meaning. The student successfully conveys the critical theological concepts of belief and eternal life, as well as the consequences of disbelief.

It reflects the theological significance of believing in the Son as essential for eternal life, which aligns well with conservative Christian beliefs.

The phrases are translated accurately, and the theological implications are clear, which aligns with a conservative Christian understanding of salvation and divine judgment. There is an appropriate balance in literalness and clarity, which aids comprehension. However, slight improvements could be made in ensuring that the nuances of 'wrath' are conveyed with perhaps a stronger emphasis on its spiritual consequences.
