Additionally, the phrase 'a ruler of the Jews' is appropriately retained, giving it the necessary gravity and context for understanding Nicodemus's role. Overall, the translation reflects a conservative Christian viewpoint by maintaining a respectful and faithful tone. The only minor suggestion would be to avoid unnecessary complexity by opting for more straightforward wording where possible, although this is a subjective point.
