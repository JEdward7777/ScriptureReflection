                "comment": "The translation captures the core message of John 3:36 effectively for a young audience. The phrase 'whoever believes in the Son has eternal life' simplifies the concept of faith and salvation, which is crucial in Christian doctrine. However, the phrase 'God's anger stays on them' might be too intense for a seven-year-old. It could be softened to make it more age-appropriate while still conveying the seriousness of unbelief. Overall, the translation does a good job of paraphrasing and making the message understandable. Therefore, I would rate this work at 85.",

It uses simple language appropriate for a seven-year-old, making it easy for children to understand the concepts of eternal life and God's anger. However, it could improve by providing more context about who the 'Son' is, perhaps by adding that 'the Son' refers to Jesus. This would ensure that the reader has a fuller understanding. Overall, it is a strong effort with minor improvements needed.",

It maintains the core elements of belief in the Son (Jesus) leading to eternal life, while also presenting the consequences of disbelief clearly. The language is simple and direct, which is appropriate for the target audience. However, it might be beneficial to soften the wording related to 'God’s anger' for a child’s comprehension, perhaps explaining it in terms of sadness rather than anger. Overall, a strong effort with room for minor adjustments.",

It communicates the importance of belief in the Son and the consequences of disbelief clearly. However, consider emphasizing the love aspect of God to make the translation feel more complete and encouraging.
