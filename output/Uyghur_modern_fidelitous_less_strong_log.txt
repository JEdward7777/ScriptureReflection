The peer review comments collectively recommend improving the Uyghur translation of Luke 1:9 by replacing the awkward and unclear phrase "چەك تاشلىغاندا شۇنداق بولدىكى، چەك ئۇنىڭغا چىقتى" with a more straightforward, natural, and contemporary expression. This change will enhance readability and flow without compromising the faithful, conservative Christian meaning or the theological integrity of the verse. Additionally, simplifying the wording to avoid convoluted or archaic terms is advised to better suit modern readers, while preserving key terms such as "مۇقەددەس جاي" for the Lord's temple. Overall, the translation is accurate but would benefit from stylistic refinements to improve clarity and naturalness.
