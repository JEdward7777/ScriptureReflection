\v 1 One night, a man named Nicodemus came to see Jesus. He was a Pharisee, which means he was a teacher who followed God's laws. Nicodemus was curious and wanted to learn more about Jesus and his teachings.
\v 2 One night, a Jewish teacher named Nicodemus came to learn from Jesus. He said, 'Rabbi, we know you are from God because no one can do the amazing things you do unless God is with him.'
\v 3 Jesus replied, "Listen closely! You must be born again to see God's Kingdom."
\v 4 
\v 4-5 Nicodemus asked Jesus, "How can someone be born again when they are already old? Can they go back into their mom's tummy to be born?" Jesus answered, "Listen closely! No one can see God's Kingdom unless they are born in a new way. They need to be born of water, like when we get baptized, and also born from God's Spirit, which gives us a new heart. This means we believe in Jesus and let Him save us to have this new life!"
\v 6 When a baby is born, they come from their mom, which is physical birth. But when someone believes in Jesus, they are born again by God's Spirit. This means they get a special gift that changes them inside and makes them part of God's family. It's like getting a new heart that believes in Jesus, which helps them to love others and live a happy life with God’s help.
\v 7 So, don’t be surprised when I say that everyone needs to be 'born again' to be part of God’s family. It’s like receiving a special new life from God, given by His Spirit, that changes our hearts. This new heart helps us to love others better and live happily with God, making every day brighter!.
\v 8 Just like the wind blows where it wants to and you can hear it, but can’t see where it comes from or where it goes, the Holy Spirit works in our lives in a similar way. When you believe in Jesus and are 'born again,' it’s the Spirit that helps change you inside. You may not see it, but you can feel how it helps you love God and others, making you part of God's special family, and that's a wonderful thing!
\v 9 Nicodemus was really puzzled and said, "How can someone be born again? What does that mean? I just don't get it! I know that when we trust Jesus, His Spirit helps us change inside, but this is all so confusing to me!"
\v 10 Jesus answered, 'You are a teacher of the people of Israel, so you should know about these important things about God! It’s surprising that you don’t understand them!'
\v 11 
\v 11-12 "Listen carefully! We share what we know about God, but you aren’t believing it. If I talk about simple things here on Earth and you don’t believe me, how can you trust me when I share about amazing things in Heaven? Believing is really important because it helps you understand!"
\v 13 No one has gone to Heaven except for Jesus. He is the only one who came down from Heaven. Jesus knows all about Heaven because He has been there. He tells us what is true, and it's important to believe Him so we can understand more about God and Heaven.
\v 14 Just like Moses lifted a snake up on a pole in the desert to help the people who were sick, Jesus will also be lifted up. If we look to Him and believe in Him, we can be saved and have eternal life with God. Just like the people needed to trust and look at the snake to get better, we need to trust Jesus to save us because He is God's Son.
\v 15 So, everyone who believes in Jesus, who is God's Son, will not be lost but will have eternal life with God. Just like the people in the desert looked at the snake on the pole and were healed, if we look to Jesus and trust Him, He will save us and give us life forever with God.
\v 16 God loves everyone in the world so much that He gave us His one and only Son, Jesus. If you believe in Him, you will never be lost; instead, you will have a special life forever with God.
\v 17 God didn't send His Son, Jesus, to point out what is wrong with us. He sent Him because He loves us so much! If we believe in Jesus, He can save us from our wrongdoings and help us have a special life with God forever.
\v 18 If you believe in God’s Son, you won’t be judged, and you will be with Him forever. But if you don’t believe, you are already separated from Him, and that means you won't enjoy being close to Him forever.
\v 19 Here’s the important part: God sent Jesus to be like a bright light that shows us how to live. But some people chose to do wrong things instead of following this light. They wanted to stay in the darkness, which means they are missing out on God’s love. When they choose darkness, they are also choosing to be away from God and His happiness, and that can lead to being judged for their choices.
\v 20 Some people do bad things, and they hide from God’s light because they don’t want to be caught doing wrong. But God’s light is there to show us His love and help us live the right way. When we choose to stay in the dark, we miss the chance to feel God’s love and joy. God wants us to come into His light, admit when we are wrong, and let Him help us make better choices.
\v 21 But when people are honest and choose to do what is right, they come into God’s light. This shows everyone that their good actions are a sign of their love for God and that they want to follow Him.
\v 22 After that, Jesus and His followers went to Judea. There, Jesus taught the people about God and how to love each other. He baptized people in water to show they were sorry for their mistakes and wanted to follow Him. This baptism was a special way for them to join God’s family and start living the way God wants us to live.
\v 23 At the same time, John the Baptist was at a place called Aenon, close to Salim, where there was a lot of water. Many people came to him because they wanted to be baptized. Baptism was a way for them to show, 'I love God and want to follow Him!' John was helping them make a special promise to God and get ready to follow Jesus and be part of God's family.
\v 24 At that time, John the Baptist was not in prison yet, and he was still teaching people. They came to him because they wanted to be baptized. Baptism was a special sign that showed they wanted to love God and be part of His family.
\v 25 Some of John the Baptist’s friends were talking to a Jewish man. They were asking him what it means to be clean in God’s eyes and how to make God happy. They wanted to understand more about special things like washing and rules that help people show their love for God.
\v 26 Some of John's friends came to him and said, "Teacher, do you remember that special man you told us about? He's Jesus, the one who helps people get closer to God. Now He is baptizing people, which is a special way to show they love God and want to follow Him. Everyone is going to see Him!"
\v 27 John replied, "No one can get anything good unless it is given to them by God from above. It's just like when you receive a present on your birthday; you can't have it unless someone gives it to you. So remember, all the good things we enjoy come from God in heaven!"
\v 28 John the Baptist said, 'You all know I told you that I am not the Christ. I am here to tell you about God, and I was sent by Him to share His message with everyone.'
\v 29 Jesus is like a groom who loves his bride. John is like the friend who stands next to the groom and is really happy when he hears the groom's voice. John's joy shows how wonderful it is to follow Jesus and share His message with everyone.
\v 30 Jesus is the most important one, and He should be the center of attention! I'm really happy to help everyone notice how great He is, even if it means I step back a little. That makes me smile! It's like I want Jesus to grow and be more important while I stay in the background, like a good friend cheering Him on.
\v 31 Jesus came from heaven, and He is the Son of God. People here on earth talk about things from their own understanding, but Jesus knows the truth about God because He speaks from above, where everything is clear and perfect.
\v 32 Jesus has seen and heard things from God that are very important, and He tells us what they are. Some people don’t believe Him, but His words matter a lot because they come directly from God.
\v 33 When you believe what Jesus tells us, you show that God is true.
\v 34 God sent Jesus to tell us what He says. Jesus speaks God's words because He has the Holy Spirit with Him all the time, and He shares everything without holding back. This shows us that Jesus is very special and speaks the truth that God wants us to hear, so we can trust Him completely.
\v 35 God loves Jesus very much and has given Him the ability to do anything. This shows how special their bond is. Because Jesus is God's Son, He helps us and keeps us safe, just like a loving friend who looks out for us.
\v 36 If you believe in Jesus, you get to live forever with God. But if you don’t believe in Him, you won't have this wonderful life. Instead, God’s anger will be on you because He wants everyone to choose to love and trust Him.
