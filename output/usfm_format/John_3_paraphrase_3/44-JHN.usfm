\v 1 There was a man named Nicodemus. He was part of the Pharisees, which were a group of Jewish leaders.
\v 2 One night, a man named Nicodemus came to see Jesus. He said, 'Teacher, we know that you have come from God because no one could do the amazing things you do unless God is with him.'
\v 3 Jesus replied, "I tell you the truth, unless someone is born again, they cannot see God's kingdom."
\v 4 Nicodemus asked Jesus, "How can a person be born again when they are already old? Can they go back into their mother's belly and be born a second time?"
\v 4-5 Nicodemus asked Jesus, "How can someone be born again when they are already old? Can they go back inside their mom's belly and be born again?" Jesus answered, "I tell you the truth, no one can enter God's kingdom unless they are born from water and the Spirit."
\v 6 Human beings can only be born as babies from their mothers, but when someone is born from the Spirit of God, they become a part of His Spirit.
\v 7 Don’t be surprised that I said you must be born again, starting fresh from God.
\v 8 The wind blows wherever it wants. You hear its sound, but you can’t tell where it comes from or where it’s going. It’s the same with everyone who is born from the Spirit.
\v 9 Nicodemus answered and said, "How can this happen?"
\v 10 Jesus answered him, 'You are a teacher of the people of Israel, and you don’t understand these important things?'
\v 11 I tell you the truth, we are sharing what we know and what we have seen, but you don’t believe our message.
\v 11-12 I am telling you the truth! We are sharing things we know and have seen, but you don’t believe what we say. If I talk about things that happen here on Earth and you don’t believe, how will you believe if I tell you about things from Heaven?
\v 13 No one has ever gone up to Heaven, except the one who came down from Heaven, the Son of Man, who is in Heaven.
\v 14 Just like Moses lifted up the snake in the desert, the Son of Man must be lifted up too.
\v 15 So that everyone who believes in Him will not be lost, but will live forever.
\v 16 God loved the world so much that He gave His one and only Son, so that anyone who believes in Him will not be lost, but will have forever life.
\v 17 God did not send His Son into the world to judge the people, but to save them through Him.
\v 18 Anyone who believes in God’s Son is not judged. But those who do not believe have already been judged because they did not believe in God’s one and only Son.
\v 19 Here is how it is: God sent His light into the world, but people liked the darkness more than the light because their actions were bad.
\v 20 Everyone who does bad things hates the light and stays away from it so that no one will see the wrong things they do.
\v 21 But everyone who does what is right comes into the light so that everyone can see that the good things they do are done with God's help.
\v 22 After this, Jesus and his friends went to the land of Judea, where they spent time with the people and baptized them.
\v 23 At the same time, John was baptizing people near a place called Aenon, close to Salim. There was a lot of water there, and many people came to be baptized.
\v 24 For John the Baptist had not been put in prison yet.
\v 25 Then, some of John’s followers started asking questions with a Jewish person about how to be clean.
\v 26 Some of John’s followers came to him and said, "Teacher, remember that man who was with you on the other side of the river? You talked about him. Now he is baptizing people and everyone is going to him!"
\v 27 John replied, "No one can have anything unless God gives it to him from heaven."
\v 28 You all know that I told you, 'I am not the Christ.' I am just someone sent to tell you about Him.
\v 29 The one who has the bride is the bridegroom. But the friend who stands and listens to him is filled with joy when he hears the bridegroom's voice. This joy of mine is now complete.
\v 30 He needs to grow bigger, and I need to step back.
\v 31 The one who comes from above is higher than everyone else. The one who is from the earth is just earthly and speaks about earthly things. But the one who comes from heaven is higher than all.
\v 32 He has seen and heard so much, and he tells people about it, but not many people believe what he says.
\v 33 Whoever accepts what Jesus says is saying that God is really true.
\v 34 God sent Jesus, and He shares God's message. God gives His Spirit to Jesus without any limits.
\v 35 The Father loves the Son very much and has given him power over everything.
\v 36 Whoever believes in the Son has eternal life. But those who don’t believe in him will not see life; instead, God’s anger stays on them.
