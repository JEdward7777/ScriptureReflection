\v 1 The record of the genealogy of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham.
\v 2 Abraham fathered Isaac, Isaac fathered Jacob, and Jacob fathered Judah and his brothers.
\v 3 Judah fathered Perez and Zerah by Tamar; Perez fathered Hezron.
\v 4 Ram begat Amminadab; Amminadab begat Nahshon; and Nahshon begat Salmon.
\v 5 Salmon fathered Boaz by Rahab, and Boaz fathered Obed by Ruth, and Obed fathered Jesse.
\v 6 And Jesse fathered David, the king; and David, the king, fathered Solomon through the wife of Uriah the Hittite.
\v 7 Solomon begat Rehoboam; Rehoboam begat Abijah; Abijah begat Asa.
\v 8 Asa begat Jehoshaphat; Jehoshaphat begat Jehoram, and Jehoram begat Uzziah.
\v 9 Uzziah fathered Jotham; Jotham fathered Ahaz; and Ahaz fathered Hezekiah.
\v 10 Hezekiah fathered Manasseh; Manasseh fathered Amon; and Amon fathered Josiah.
\v 11 And Josiah fathered Jeconiah and his brothers at the time of the Babylonian exile.
\v 12 After the Babylonian exile, Jeconiah fathered Shealtiel, and Shealtiel fathered Zerubbabel.
\v 13 Zerubbabel fathered Abiud, Abiud fathered Eliakim, and Eliakim fathered Azor.
\v 14 Azor fathered Sadok, Sadok fathered Achim, and Achim fathered Elihud.
\v 15 Elihud fathered Eleazar; Eleazar fathered Matthan; and Matthan fathered Jacob.
\v 16 And Jacob fathered Joseph, the husband of Mary, of whom was born Jesus, who is called Christ.
\v 17 Therefore, all generations from Abraham unto David are fourteen generations; and from David unto the Babylonian exile are fourteen generations; and from the Babylonian exile unto Christ are fourteen generations.
\v 18 Now the birth of Jesus Christ took place in this manner: when His mother Mary was betrothed to Joseph, before they came together, she was found to be with child by the Holy Spirit.
\v 19 But Joseph her husband, being a righteous man and unwilling to bring her public disgrace, resolved to put her away secretly.
\v 20 But while he pondered these things, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream, saying, 'Joseph, son of David, do not be afraid to take Mary as your wife; for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Spirit.'
\v 21 And she will give birth to a Son, and you shall name Him Jesus, for He will save His people from their sins.
\v 22 All this took place to fulfill what the Lord spoke through the prophet, saying:
\v 23 Behold, the virgin will conceive in her womb and bear a son, and they shall call His name Emmanuel, which is translated, 'God is with us.'
\v 24 And when Joseph awoke from sleep, he did as the angel of the Lord commanded him and received Mary as his wife.
\v 25 And he did not know her intimately until she had given birth to her firstborn son, and he named him Jesus.
\c 2
\p
\v 1 Now after Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea in the days of King Herod, behold, wise men from the east came to Jerusalem.
\v 2 saying, 'Where is the one who was born king of the Jews? For we have seen His star in the east and have come to worship Him.'
\v 3 When King Herod heard this, he was disturbed, and all Jerusalem with him.
\v 4 And summoning all the chief priests and scribes of the people, he asked them where the Christ is to be born.
\v 5 They said to him, 'In Bethlehem of Judea; for thus it is written by the prophet:'
\v 6 And you, Bethlehem, land of Judah, are certainly not the least among the rulers of Judah; for out of you will arise a leader who will guide my people Israel.
\v 7 Then Herod, secretly calling the wise men, asked them about the exact time when the star had appeared.
\v 8 And he sent them to Bethlehem, saying, 'Go and search diligently for the child; and when you find him, inform me, so that I may come and worship him.'
\v 9 When they heard the king, they went on their way; and behold, the star that they had seen in the east went before them until it came to rest over the place where the child was.
\v 10 When they saw the star, they rejoiced with exceedingly great joy.
\v 11 And entering the house, they found the child and his mother, Mary; and falling down, they worshiped him. And having opened their treasures, they presented gifts to him: gold, frankincense, and myrrh.

*Footnote: The gifts of gold, frankincense, and myrrh hold profound significance in Christian theology. Gold represents Christ's kingship, frankincense symbolizes his divinity and the priestly role, and myrrh, often associated with burial, foreshadows his suffering and death.*
\v 12 And having been warned in a dream not to return to Herod, they returned to their own country by another road. 

*Footnote: This warning in a dream underscores the importance of divine communication in guiding the actions of the wise men, emphasizing the biblical theme of dreams as a means of revelation.*
\v 13 After their departure, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream, saying, 'Get up, take the child and his mother, and flee to Egypt, and stay there until I tell you; for Herod is about to search for the child to destroy him.'
\v 14 When he arose, he took the child and his mother that night and fled to Egypt.

*Footnote: Joseph's flight to Egypt signifies divine protection over the child Jesus, illustrating God's intervention in fulfilling His plan.*
\v 15 And he remained there until the death of Herod, so that what was spoken by the Lord through the prophet might be fulfilled, saying: 'Out of Egypt, I have called My Son.'
\v 16 Then Herod, realizing that he had been deceived by the Magi, became exceedingly enraged; and sending out, he commanded the slaughter of all the male children in Bethlehem and in all its surrounding regions who were two years old and under, according to the time he had learned from the Magi.
\v 17 Then was fulfilled what was spoken by the prophet Jeremiah, saying:
\v 18 A voice in Ramah was heard, weeping and great mourning; Rachel weeping for her children, and she would not be comforted, for they are no more.
\v 19 After the death of Herod, an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream in Egypt.
\v 20 saying, 'Rise, take the child and his mother, and go to the land of Israel, for those who sought the child's life are dead.'
\v 21 And he arose, took the child and his mother, and went to the land of Israel.
\v 22 But upon hearing that Archelaus reigned over Judea instead of his father Herod, he was afraid to go to Judea; and being warned in a dream, he withdrew to the region of Galilee.
\v 23 And coming, he dwelt in a city called Nazareth, to fulfill what was spoken by the prophets, that he would be called a Nazarene.
\c 3
\p
\v 1 "In those days, John the Baptist appeared, preaching in the wilderness of Judea." 

*Footnote: John's ministry in the wilderness symbolizes a call to repentance and preparation for the coming Messiah, reflecting the prophetic tradition of preparing the way for the Lord.*
\v 2 And saying, 'Repent, for the kingdom of heaven has come near.'
\v 3 For this is he of whom the prophet Isaiah spoke, saying: 'A voice of one crying out in the wilderness, Prepare the way of the Lord; make straight His paths.'
\v 4 "John wore clothing made of camel's hair, with a leather belt around his waist; and his food was locusts and wild honey." 

*Footnote: John's choice of clothing and diet is reflective of prophetic figures in Jewish tradition, symbolizing simplicity and a call to repentance.*
\v 5 Then came out to him all Jerusalem and all Judea, and all the region around the Jordan.
\v 6 And they were baptized by John in the Jordan River, confessing their sins.
\v 7 But when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming for his baptism, he said to them, 'You offspring of vipers! Who has warned you to flee from the coming wrath?'
\v 8 Therefore, bear fruit worthy of repentance.
\v 9 And do not think to say among yourselves, ‘We have Abraham as our father.’ For I tell you, God is able to raise up children for Abraham out of these stones.
\v 10 The axe is already laid at the root of the trees; therefore, every tree that does not produce good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.
\v 11 "I indeed baptize you in water for repentance; but He who comes after me is mightier than I, whose sandals I am not worthy to carry. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and with fire."
\v 12 His winnowing fork is in His hand, and He will thoroughly cleanse His threshing floor; He will gather His wheat into the barn, but the chaff He will burn with unquenchable fire.
\v 13 Then Jesus came from Galilee to the Jordan to be baptized by John.

*Footnote: This significant event marks the commencement of Jesus' public ministry, illustrating His identification with humanity and His commitment to fulfill all righteousness.*
\v 14 But John stopped Him, saying, "I need to be baptized by You, and why do You come to me?"
\v 15 But Jesus replied to him, "Permit it now; for it is proper for us to fulfill all righteousness." Then John permitted Him.
\v 16 As soon as Jesus was baptized, He came up out of the water. At that moment, the heavens were opened to Him, and He saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and coming to rest on Him.
\v 17 And behold, a voice from the heavens said, 'This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.'
\c 4
\p
\v 1 Then Jesus was led by the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted by the devil.
\v 2 And after fasting forty days and forty nights, He was hungry.
\v 3 And the tempter approached Him, saying, 'If you are the Son of God, tell these stones to become bread.'
\v 4 But He answered and said, 'It is written, Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that comes forth from the mouth of God.'
\v 5 Then the devil took Him to the holy city and set Him on the pinnacle of the temple.
\v 6 And he said to Him, 'If you are the Son of God, throw yourself down; for it is written, ‘He will command His angels concerning you,’ and ‘They will lift you up in their hands, so that you will not strike your foot against a stone.’
\v 7 Jesus said to him, 'It is also written: You shall not put the Lord your God to the test.'
\v 8 Again, the devil took Him to an exceedingly high mountain and displayed before Him all the kingdoms of the earth and their glory.
\v 9 And he said to Him, 'All these things I will give to you, if you fall down and worship me.'
\v 10 Then Jesus said to him, "Be gone, Satan! For it is written, 'You shall worship the Lord your God and serve Him alone.'"
\v 11 And the devil left Him; behold, angels came and ministered to Him.
\v 12 When Jesus heard that John was imprisoned, He departed to Galilee.
\v 13 And leaving Nazareth, He went and dwelt in Capernaum by the sea, in the region of Zebulun and Naphtali.
\v 14 so that what was spoken through the prophet Isaiah might be fulfilled, saying:
\v 15 The land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali, the way by the sea, across the Jordan, Galilee of the Gentiles.
\v 16 The people who sat in darkness have seen a great light; and to those who dwelt in the region and shadow of death, light has dawned upon them.
\v 17 From that time on, Jesus began to preach and say, "Repent, for the kingdom of heaven has drawn near."
\v 18 As Jesus walked along the shore of the Sea of Galilee, He saw two brothers, Simon, called Peter, and his brother Andrew, throwing a net into the sea, for they were fishermen.
\v 19 And He said to them, 'Come, follow Me, and I will make you fishers of men.'
\v 20 And immediately they left their nets and followed Him.
\v 21 And going from there, He saw two other brothers, James the son of Zebedee and John his brother, in the boat with their father, Zebedee, mending their nets, and He called them.
\v 22 And immediately they left the boat and their father and followed Him.
\v 23 And Jesus traveled throughout all of Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, proclaiming the good news of the kingdom, and healing every sickness and every disease among the people.
\v 24 And news about Him went out into all of Syria; and they brought to Him all who were suffering from various diseases and torments, possessed by demons, those afflicted with seizures, and the paralyzed; and He healed them.
\v 25 And great crowds followed Him from Galilee, the Decapolis, Jerusalem, Judea, and beyond the Jordan.
\c 5
\p
\v 1 Seeing the crowds, He went up on the mountain, and when He sat down, His disciples came to Him.
\v 2 And He began to teach them, saying:
\v 3 Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
\v 4 Blessed are those who mourn, for they shall be comforted.
\v 5 Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the earth.
\v 6 Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they shall be satisfied.
\v 7 Blessed are the merciful, for they shall obtain mercy.
\v 8 Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God.
\v 9 Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called sons of God.
\v 10 Blessed are those who are persecuted because of righteousness, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
\v 11 "Blessed are you when they insult you and persecute you, and falsely say all kinds of evil against you for My sake." 

*Footnote: This verse highlights the experience of early Christians who faced persecution for their faith. Being insulted and accused falsely for the sake of Christ underscores the challenges believers may encounter in their commitment to Him.
\v 12 Rejoice and be exceedingly glad, for your reward is great in heaven; for so they persecuted the prophets who were before you.
\v 13 You are the salt of the earth; but if the salt should lose its flavor, with what shall it be salted? It is no longer good for anything except to be thrown out and trampled underfoot by men.
\v 14 You are the light of the world. A city set on a hill cannot be hidden.
\v 15 "Nor do they light a lamp and place it under a basket, but on a lampstand, and it shines for all who are in the house." 

*Footnote: In ancient households, lamps were essential for light, symbolizing the visibility of good deeds. This imagery encourages believers to actively display their faith through actions that reflect the light of Christ, making a positive impact on those around them.
\v 16 In the same way, let your light shine before others, so that they may see your good works and give glory to your Father who is in heaven.
\v 17 Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them.
\v 18 Truly, I say to you, until heaven and earth pass away, not a single dot or stroke will disappear from the Law until all is accomplished.
\v 19 "Therefore, whoever breaks one of the least of these commandments and teaches others in this manner will be called least in the kingdom of heaven; but whoever practices and teaches them will be called great in the kingdom of heaven."

*Footnote: In this context, being called 'least' signifies a lesser role or recognition within the kingdom of heaven, while being called 'great' denotes a higher standing. This distinction underscores the importance of both obeying and imparting God's commandments.
\v 20 "For I say to you that unless your righteousness exceeds that of the scribes and Pharisees, you shall not enter the kingdom of heaven." 

*Footnote: The 'scribes and Pharisees' were respected religious leaders in Jewish society known for their strict observance of the Law. Jesus challenges His followers to pursue a righteousness that transcends mere legalism, calling for a heartfelt devotion to God. This higher standard signifies that true righteousness is not only about external compliance but also about a genuine relationship with God, embodying the essence of Christian living.
\v 21 You have heard that it was said to the ancients, 'You shall not commit murder,' and whoever commits murder will be subject to judgment.
\v 22 But I say to you that everyone who is angry without cause with his brother will be liable to judgment; and whoever says to his brother, 'Raca!' shall be liable to the council; but whoever says, 'You fool!' shall be liable to Gehenna. 

*Footnote: The phrase 'angry without cause' emphasizes the serious nature of unwarranted anger, which can lead to judgment. The term 'Raca' indicates contempt and devaluation of a person's worth, while 'You fool!' (μωρέ) expresses a moral judgment. Both terms illustrate the grave consequences of anger and insults in relationships, reflecting the cultural significance of honor and respect in this context.
\v 23 "Therefore, when you are offering your gift there at the altar, and you remember that your brother holds something against you, leave your gift there at the altar; first go and be reconciled to your brother, and then come and offer your gift." 

*Footnote: The altar represents a sacred space for worship and offerings to God. The act of offering symbolizes devotion, but true worship requires reconciliation with others, highlighting the importance of maintaining harmonious relationships as an expression of one's faith.
\v 24 "Leave your gift there at the altar; first go and be reconciled to your brother, and then return to offer your gift." 

*Footnote: This instruction highlights the significance of resolving conflicts with others before approaching God in worship. In the Jewish context, offering gifts at the altar symbolizes devotion to God, but true worship is rooted in maintaining harmonious relationships with others, reflecting the essence of one's faith.
\v 25 "Settle matters quickly with your adversary while you are on your way to the court, or else your adversary may hand you over to the judge, and the judge may hand you over to the officer, and you will be thrown into prison." 
*Footnote: This passage highlights the urgent need for reconciliation before conflicts escalate into legal disputes. In a broader biblical context, it reflects the call to love and forgiveness that Jesus exemplifies. Believers are encouraged to prioritize peace in their relationships, understanding that unresolved conflicts can lead to greater consequences. Conflict resolution is a vital aspect of Christian living, fostering harmony and reflecting the character of Christ.
\v 26 Truly, I say to you, you will not leave there until you have paid the very last penny.
\v 27 "You have heard that it was said to the ancients, 'You shall not commit adultery.'"

*Footnote: This commandment, grounded in the Mosaic Law, highlights the sanctity of marriage and the grave responsibility of fidelity. In Jewish culture, adultery represented not only a moral failing but a serious breach of social and familial trust, undermining God's design for marital relationships. Jesus emphasizes that true adherence to this commandment transcends mere action; it demands purity of heart and intention. Lustful thoughts are not merely mental exercises but can lead to actions that violate God's commandment. This teaching underscores the call to cultivate both faithfulness in behavior and purity in one’s innermost thoughts, reminding believers of the high moral standards set by Jesus for maintaining fidelity and honor in marital commitments.
\v 28 But I say to you that everyone who looks at a woman with lustful intent has already committed adultery with her in his heart. 

*Footnote: This statement emphasizes the seriousness with which Jesus views lust. He indicates that even the desire for someone unlawfully is equivalent to committing adultery, reflecting the belief that one's inner thoughts and intentions are as important as outward actions. In the cultural context, such teachings highlight the high moral standards expected in relationships, stressing the need for purity of heart.
\v 29 "But if your right eye causes you to stumble, tear it out and cast it away from you; for it is more advantageous for you to lose one of your members than for your whole body to be cast into hell." 

*Footnote: This verse uses strong metaphorical language to stress the necessity of radical measures against sin. The phrasing 'cast it away from you' emphasizes the decisive actions one must take to avoid spiritual ruin, highlighting the serious consequences of unaddressed sin.
\v 30 "And if your right hand causes you to stumble, cut it off and cast it away from you; for it is better for you to lose one of your members than for your entire body to be thrown into hell." 

*Footnote: This verse employs strong metaphorical language, urging readers to take decisive action against sin. The use of 'cut it off' and 'cast it away' illustrates the radical measures one must be willing to undertake to avoid spiritual peril, reinforcing the gravity of sin's consequences.
\v 31 "It was said, 'Whoever divorces his wife shall give her a written divorce decree.'" 

*Footnote: The requirement for a written divorce decree highlights the serious implications of divorce in the Jewish context. Divorce is not merely a legal matter; it represents a profound violation of the marital covenant established by God. This teaching underscores the sanctity of marriage, and Jesus’ words reflect the heart of God's design for unity and fidelity between spouses, calling His followers to honor these commitments deeply.
\v 32 But I say to you that whoever divorces his wife, except for the reason of fornication, renders her an adulteress; and whoever marries a divorced woman commits adultery.
\v 33 "Again, you have heard that it was said, 'You shall not break your oaths, but you must fulfill your vows to the Lord.'  

*Footnote: In Jewish tradition, oaths are regarded as sacred commitments, representing integrity and accountability within the community. Breaking an oath not only disrespects one's personal promises but also undermines trust among individuals and dishonors God. Jesus calls His followers to a higher standard of honesty and integrity, emphasizing that their words should be truthful without needing oaths. This teaching embodies foundational Christian values of truthfulness and faithfulness, highlighting the importance of maintaining commitments in one's relationships with God and others.
\v 34 "But I say to you, do not swear any oaths at all; neither by heaven, for it is the throne of God," 

*Footnote: In the context of Jewish culture, oaths carried profound weight as they represented solemn commitments made in the presence of God. This teaching emphasizes the necessity of integrity in speech, encouraging followers of Christ to foster a level of honesty in their commitments that eliminates the need for oaths. The directive challenges believers to cultivate a character where their word alone holds truth, reflecting Jesus' call for transparency and accountability in all interactions. In contemporary Christian practice, this guidance urges the community to prioritize sincerity and integrity, aligning personal conduct with the ethical standards that exemplify Christ's teachings and reinforcing trust and accountability within the church and society.
\v 35 And do not swear by the earth, for it is the footstool of the Lord’s feet; nor by Jerusalem, for it is the city of the great King.
\v 36 "And do not swear by your own head, for you cannot make one hair white or black." 

*Footnote: This teaching underscores the gravity of oaths in Jewish culture, emphasizing the importance of sincerity in commitments. By stating that one cannot alter the color of their hair, Jesus highlights God’s ultimate authority over all aspects of life, including the physical attributes of humanity. This serves as a reminder that human capability is limited; thus, one should approach commitments with integrity and truthfulness. Believers are encouraged to ensure their words hold weight, relying on honesty rather than the need for oaths to affirm their promises.
\v 37 "Let your word be 'Yes' or 'No'; anything more than this comes from the evil one." 

*Footnote: This teaching emphasizes the importance of integrity and clarity in communication. Jesus calls His followers to speak truthfully, avoiding the need for oaths, which can sometimes lead to manipulation and deceit. The term 'the evil one' refers to Satan, symbolizing moral corruption and the temptation to distort truth. By advocating for straightforwardness, Jesus urges His disciples to embody honesty and transparency in their interactions, reflecting God’s character.
\v 38 "You have heard that it was said, 'An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth.'"  

*Footnote: This phrase reflects an ancient principle of justice known as lex talionis, which aimed at limiting revenge and ensuring proportionality in punishment. Jesus contrasts this principle with His teachings on mercy and forgiveness, urging His followers to move beyond strict retribution. This call to non-retaliation challenges believers to adopt attitudes of love and grace, thus fostering a spirit of reconciliation and peace in place of the cycle of vengeance.
\v 39 But I say to you, do not resist the evil person; but if anyone slaps you on the right cheek, turn to him the other also.
\v 40 And if anyone desires to take you to court and seize your tunic, allow him to take your cloak too.
\v 41 "And whoever compels you to go one mile, go with him two miles." 

*Footnote: In the first-century Roman context, the practice of impressment allowed a soldier to force a Jewish individual to carry their burden for a mile. Jesus’ teaching to go an additional mile not only reflects a willingness to serve but also illustrates the profound impact of love and kindness in situations of coercion or oppression. This instruction invites believers to transcend mere compliance with obligations and embody a spirit of generosity and compassion. In contemporary terms, this can be seen as a call for Christians to respond to challenges and demands with an attitude of exceeding expectations, fostering deeper connections through acts of love and selflessness, thus truly representing the character of Christ in everyday interactions.
\v 42 Give to whoever asks you, and do not turn away from the one who wants to borrow from you.
\v 43 You have heard that it was said, 'You shall love your neighbor and hate your enemy.'
\v 44 But I say to you, love your enemies; bless those who curse you; do good to those who hate you, and pray for those who mistreat you and persecute you.
\v 45 so that you may be children of your Father in heaven. For He causes His sun to rise on both the evil and the good, and He sends rain on the righteous and the unrighteous.
\v 46 For if you love those who love you, what reward is there for you? Do not even the tax collectors do the same?
\v 47 And if you greet only your friends, what more are you doing than others? Do not even the tax collectors act in the same way?
\v 48 Therefore, you are to be perfect, as your heavenly Father is perfect.
\c 6
\p
\v 1 Take care not to perform your acts of charity in front of others to be noticed by them; otherwise, you will not receive any reward from your Father who is in heaven.
\v 2 Therefore, when you give to the needy, do not sound a trumpet before you, as those who pretend to be righteous do in the synagogues and in the streets, seeking glory from men. Truly, I say to you, they have already received their reward.
\v 3 But when you give alms, do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing,
\v 4 So that your almsgiving may be in secret; and your Father who sees in secret will reward you publicly.
\v 5 And when you pray, you shall not be like the hypocrites, for they love to stand and pray in the synagogues and at the corners of the streets, that they may be seen by men. Truly, I say to you, they have their reward.
\v 6 But you, when you pray, enter into your closet, and having closed your door, pray to your Father who is in secret; and your Father who sees in secret will reward you in public.
\v 7 And when you pray, do not use vain repetition like the Gentiles; for they think they will be heard for their many words.
\v 8 Therefore, do not be like them; for your Father knows your needs before you even ask Him.
\v 9 Thus, therefore, you pray: Our Father in heaven, hallowed be Thy name.
\v 10 Let Your kingdom come; let Your will be done, on earth as it is in heaven.
\v 11 Give us this day our daily bread.
\v 12 And forgive us our debts, as we also have forgiven our debtors.
\v 13 And do not lead us into temptation, but deliver us from the evil one. For yours is the kingdom and the power and the glory, forever. Amen.
\v 14 For if you forgive people their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you.
\v 15 But if you do not forgive others their trespasses, neither will your Father in heaven forgive your trespasses.
\v 16 When you fast, do not become sorrowful like the hypocrites; for they disfigure their faces to appear to men as fasting. Truly, I say to you, they have already received their reward.
\v 17 But when you fast, anoint your head and wash your face.
\v 18 that you may not appear to men as one who is fasting, but to your Father who is in secret; and your Father who sees what is done in secret will reward you in public.
\v 19 Do not accumulate treasures for yourselves on earth, where moth and rust corrupt, and where thieves break in and steal.
\v 20 But store up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust destroys, and where thieves do not break in and steal.
\v 21 For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.
\v 22 The lamp of the body is the eye; if, therefore, your eye is healthy, your whole body will be full of light.
\v 23 But if your eye is evil, your whole body will be full of darkness. If, therefore, the light that is within you is darkness, how great is that darkness?
\v 24 No one can serve two masters; for he will either hate the one and love the other, or be devoted to one and disregard the other. You cannot serve both God and mammon.
\v 25 Therefore, I tell you, do not be anxious about your life, what you will eat or what you will drink, nor about your body, what you will wear. Is not life more than food, and the body more than clothing?
\v 26 Consider the birds of the air; they neither sow nor reap nor gather into barns, yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not of much greater value than they?
\v 27 And which of you by worrying can add even a single moment to your lifespan?
\v 28 And concerning clothing, why do you worry? Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow; they do not toil nor spin.
\v 29 But I tell you that not even Solomon in all his splendor was clothed like one of these.
\v 30 But if God so clothes the grass of the field, which is today in the field and tomorrow is thrown into the furnace, will He not clothe you even more, you of such little faith?
\v 31 Therefore, be not anxious, saying, 'What shall we eat?' or 'What shall we drink?' or 'What shall we wear?'
\v 32 For all these things the nations seek; your heavenly Father knows that you need all of them.
\v 33 But seek first the kingdom of God and His righteousness, and all these things will be added to you as well.
\v 34 Therefore, do not be anxious about tomorrow, for tomorrow will care for its own concerns. Sufficient for the day is its own trouble.
\c 7
\p
\v 1 Do not judge, so that you will not be judged.
\v 2 For with the measure you use to judge, it will be measured back to you.
\v 3 Why do you see the speck that is in your brother's eye, but do not perceive the log that is in your own eye?
\v 4 Or how can you say to your brother, ‘Let me take the speck out of your eye,’ when there is a beam in your own eye?
\v 5 You hypocrite! First, take the log out of your own eye, and then you will see clearly to take the speck out of your brother's eye.
\v 6 Do not give what is holy to dogs, nor cast your pearls before swine, lest they trample them underfoot and turn back to tear you.
\v 7 Ask, and it will be given to you; seek, and you will find; knock, and it will be opened for you.
\v 8 For everyone who asks receives, and he who seeks finds, and to him who knocks, it shall be opened.
\v 9 Or what man among you, if his son asks for bread, will give him a stone?
\v 10 And if he asks for a fish, will he give him a serpent rather?
\v 11 If you, being evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father who is in heaven give good things to those who ask Him?
\v 12 Therefore, whatever you want others to do for you, do also for them; for this sums up the Law and the Prophets.
\v 13 Enter through the narrow gate; for the gate is wide and the broad way that leads to destruction, and many are those who enter through it.
\v 14 How narrow is the gate, and how pressed is the way that leads to life! And few are those who find it.
\v 15 Beware of false prophets, who come to you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly they are ravenous wolves.
\v 16 You will know them by their fruits. Do people gather grapes from thornbushes or figs from thistles?
\v 17 In the same way, every good tree produces good fruit, but a rotten tree produces bad fruit.
\v 18 A good tree cannot bear bad fruit, nor can a bad tree bear good fruit.
\v 19 Every tree that does not produce good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.
\v 20 Therefore, by their fruits you shall know them.
\v 21 Not everyone who says to me, 'Lord, Lord,' will enter the kingdom of heaven; but the one who does the will of my Father who is in heaven will enter.
\v 22 Many will say to me on that Day of Judgment, 'Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in Your name, cast out demons in Your name, and perform many mighty works in Your name?'
\v 23 And then I will declare to them, 'I never knew you; depart from me, you workers of lawlessness.'
\v 24 Therefore, everyone who hears these words of mine and acts upon them is like a wise man who built his house on the rock.
\v 25 And the rain fell, and the rivers came, and the winds blew and beat against that house, yet it did not fall, for it was founded upon the rock.
\v 26 And everyone who hears these words of mine and does not do them will be compared to a foolish man who built his house on the sand.
\v 27 And the rain fell, and the rivers came, and the winds blew and struck that house; and it fell, and great was its fall.
\v 28 When Jesus finished speaking, the crowds were astonished at His teaching.
\v 29 For He was teaching them as one having authority, and not as the scribes.
\c 8
\p
\v 1 When He came down from the mountain, great crowds followed Him.
\v 2 And behold, a leper approached Him, kneeling before Him, saying, 'Lord, if You are willing, You can cleanse me.'
\v 3 And stretching out His hand, Jesus touched him, saying, 'I am willing; be cleansed.' And immediately his leprosy was cleansed.
\v 4 And Jesus said to him, "See that you tell no one; but go, show yourself to the priest, and present the offering that Moses commanded for your purification as a witness to them."
\v 5 And when He entered Capernaum, a centurion came to Him, pleading with Him and saying,
\v 6 "Lord, my servant is at home, paralyzed, and dreadfully tormented."
\v 7 And Jesus said to him, 'I will come and heal him.'
\v 8 But the centurion answered and said, 'Lord, I am not worthy that You should come under my roof; only speak a word, and my servant will be healed.'
\v 9 For I am a man placed under authority, having soldiers under my command. I say to this one, 'Go,' and he goes; and to another, 'Come,' and he comes; and to my servant, 'Do this,' and he does it.
\v 10 When Jesus heard this, He marveled and said to those following Him, 'Amen, I say to you, I have not found such great faith, not even in Israel.'
\v 11 But I say to you that many will come from the east and the west and will recline with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven.
\v 12 But the sons of the kingdom will be cast out into outer darkness; there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.
\v 13 And Jesus said to the centurion, 'Go; let it be done to you according to your faith.' And his servant was healed immediately.
\v 14 And when Jesus entered Peter's house, He saw his mother-in-law lying ill with a high fever.
\v 15 And He touched her hand, and the fever left her; and she arose and began to serve Him.
\v 16 "When evening came, they brought to Him many who were demon-possessed, and He cast out the spirits with a word and healed all who were suffering."
\v 17 This was to fulfill what was spoken through the prophet Isaiah: "He took our infirmities upon Himself and carried our sicknesses."
\v 18 When Jesus saw the large crowds around Him, He commanded them to depart to the other side.
\v 19 And a scribe came to Him and said, "Teacher, I will follow You wherever You go."
\v 20 And Jesus said to him, "Foxes have dens, and the birds of the air have nests; but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay His head."
\v 21 Another disciple of His said to Him, "Lord, allow me first to go and bury my father."
\v 22 But Jesus said to him, "Follow Me, and let the dead bury their own dead."
\v 23 And as He boarded the boat, His disciples followed Him.
\v 24 And behold, a great storm arose on the sea, so that the boat was swamped by the waves; but He was asleep.
\v 25 And coming to Him, His disciples awoke Him, saying, "Lord, save us; we are perishing!"
\v 26 And He said to them, "You of little faith, why are you afraid?" Then He got up and rebuked the winds and the sea, and there was a great calm.
\v 27 And the men marveled, saying, "What sort of man is this, that even the winds and the sea obey Him?"
\v 28 And when He had come to the other side, to the region of the Gadarenes, two demon-possessed men met Him, coming out of the tombs; they were exceedingly fierce, so that no one could pass that way.
\v 29 And behold, they cried out, saying, 'What do You have to do with us, Jesus, Son of God? Have You come here to torment us before the appointed time?'
\v 30 Now there was a large herd of pigs feeding some distance away from them.
\v 31 And the demons implored Him, saying, 'If You cast us out, permit us to go into the herd of pigs.'
\v 32 And He said to them, "Go." And they went out and entered the herd of pigs; and behold, the herd rushed down the steep bank into the sea and drowned.
\v 33 And the herdsmen fled, and going into the city, they reported all that had happened, especially concerning the demon-possessed men.
\v 34 And behold, the entire city came out to meet Jesus; and upon seeing Him, they earnestly begged Him to depart from their boundaries.
\c 9
\p
\v 1 And He got into a boat, crossed over, and arrived at His own city.
\v 2 And behold, they brought to Him a paralyzed man lying on a bed; and upon seeing their faith, Jesus said to the paralyzed man, 'Take heart, my son; your sins are forgiven you.'
\v 3 And behold, some of the scribes said among themselves, 'This man is speaking blasphemy.'
\v 4 And Jesus, perceiving their thoughts, said, "Why do you harbor evil thoughts in your hearts?"
\v 5 Which is easier to say: 'Your sins are forgiven,' or to say: 'Get up and walk'?
\v 6 But so that you may understand that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins, He then said to the paralytic, 'Get up, take your mat, and go home.'
\v 7 And he arose and went to his own house.
\v 8 But when the crowds saw it, they were filled with awe and glorified God, who had given such authority to men.
\v 9 As Jesus passed by, He saw a man sitting at the tax collector's station, named Matthew, and He said to him, 'Follow Me.' And he arose and followed Him.
\v 10 And it came to pass, as He was reclining at table in the house, that many tax collectors and sinners came and gathered together with Jesus and His disciples.
\v 11 And when the Pharisees saw this, they said to His disciples, 'Why does your Teacher dine with tax collectors and sinners?'
\v 12 But when Jesus heard this, He said to them, 'It is not those who are well who need a physician, but those who are sick.'
\v 13 "Go and learn what this means: 'I desire mercy, not sacrifice.' For I did not come to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance." (See Hosea 6:6)
\v 14 Then the disciples of John came to Him, saying, 'Why do we and the Pharisees fast often, but Your disciples do not fast?'
\v 15 And Jesus said to them, 'Can the sons of the bridegroom mourn while the bridegroom is with them? They cannot mourn as long as the bridegroom is with them. The days will come when the bridegroom will be taken away from them, and then they will fast.'
\v 16 No one sews a patch of unshrunken cloth onto an old garment; for the patch will pull away from the garment, and a worse tear will result.
\v 17 Neither do they put new wine into old wineskins; otherwise the skins burst, and the wine spills out, and the wineskins are ruined. But they put new wine into new wineskins, and both are preserved.
\v 18 As He spoke to them, behold, a ruler came and fell at His feet, saying, 'My daughter has just now died; but come and lay Your hand upon her, and she shall be restored to life.'
\v 19 And Jesus arose and followed him, along with his disciples.
\v 20 And behold, a woman who had been suffering from a flow of blood for twelve years came up behind Him and touched the hem of His garment.
\v 21 For she said to herself, 'If I can just touch His garment, I will be healed.'
\v 22 But Jesus, turning and seeing her, said, "Take heart, Daughter; your faith has saved you." And from that moment, the woman was healed.
\v 23 And when Jesus arrived at the ruler's house, He saw the flute players and the crowd of mourners, and said to them,
\v 24 "Please leave, for the girl has not died, but sleeps." And they mocked Him.
\v 25 But when the crowd had been sent away, He went in, took her by the hand, and the maiden arose.
\v 26 And this report went out into all that region of Galilee.
\v 27 And as Jesus went on from there, two blind men followed Him, crying out, "Have mercy on us, Son of David!"
\v 28 And when He entered the house, the blind men approached Him, and Jesus said to them, "Do you believe that I am able to do this?" They answered Him, "Yes, Lord."
\v 29 Then He touched their eyes, saying, "Let it be done to you according to your faith."
\v 30 And their eyes were opened; and Jesus sternly warned them, saying, "See that no one knows this."
\v 31 And when they went out, they spread the word about Him throughout all that land.
\v 32 As they were departing, behold, they brought to Him a deaf-mute possessed by a demon.
\v 33 And when the demon was cast out, the mute spoke; and the crowds were amazed, saying, 'Never has such a thing been seen in Israel!'
\v 34 But the Pharisees were saying, 'He is casting out demons by the chief of demons.'
\v 35 And Jesus went about all the cities and villages, teaching in their synagogues, proclaiming the good news of the kingdom, and healing every disease and every ailment among the people.
\v 36 But when He saw the crowds, He was filled with compassion for them, because they were harassed and helpless, like sheep without a shepherd.
\v 37 Then He said to His disciples, 'The harvest is indeed abundant, but the laborers are few.'
\v 38 Therefore, pray to the Lord of the harvest to send out workers into His harvest.
\c 10
\p
\v 1 And having called His twelve disciples to Him, He gave them authority over unclean spirits, to cast them out, and to heal every disease and every affliction.
\v 2 The names of the twelve apostles are these: First, Simon, who is called Peter, and his brother Andrew; James, the son of Zebedee, and his brother John.
\v 3 Philip and Bartholomew, Thomas and Matthew the tax collector, James the son of Alphaeus, and Thaddeus.
\v 4 Simon the Zealot, and Judas Iscariot, who also betrayed Him.
\v 5 These twelve Jesus sent out, having commanded them, 'Do not go among the Gentiles, and do not enter a city of the Samaritans;'
\v 6 But rather go to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.
\v 7 As you go, preach, saying, 'The kingdom of heaven has drawn near.'
\v 8 Heal the sick, cleanse the lepers, raise the dead, cast out demons; freely you have received; freely give.
\v 9 Do not acquire gold or silver or bronze for yourselves to carry in your belts.
\v 10 Do not take a bag for the journey, nor two tunics, nor sandals, nor staff; for a worker deserves sustenance.
\v 11 And into whichever city or village you enter, search for who is worthy in it, and there stay until you depart.
\v 12 As you enter the house, greet it, saying, 'Peace to this house.'
\v 13 And if the house is deserving, let your peace rest upon it; but if it is not deserving, let your peace return to you.
\v 14 And whoever does not receive you or listen to your words, as you leave that house or city, shake the dust off your feet.
\v 15 Verily, I say to you, it will be more bearable for the city of Sodom and Gomorrah on the day of judgment than for that city.
\v 16 Behold, I am sending you out as sheep in the midst of wolves; therefore be as wise as serpents and innocent as doves.
\v 17 "Beware of men, for they will hand you over to the Sanhedrin and scourge you in their synagogues."
\v 18 "And you will be delivered up before governors and kings for my sake, to bear witness to them and to the Gentiles."
\v 19 But when they hand you over, do not worry about how to speak or what to say; for it will be given to you at that time what you should say.
\v 20 For it is not you who will be speaking, but the Spirit of your Father speaking through you.
\v 21 "A brother will deliver a brother to death, and a father his child; and children will rise up against their parents and cause them to be killed."
\v 22 And you will be hated by all for my name’s sake; but the one who endures to the end will be saved.
\v 23 When they persecute you in this city, flee to another; for indeed, I say to you, you will not finish going through cities of Israel before the Son of Man comes.
\v 24 A disciple is not above his teacher, nor is a servant above his master.
\v 25 It is enough for the disciple to become like his teacher, and the servant like his master. If they have called the master of the house Beelzebul, how much more will they malign those of his household?
\v 26 Therefore, do not fear them; for nothing is concealed that will not be revealed, nor hidden that will not be disclosed.
\v 27 What I instruct you in the darkness, proclaim in the light; and what you hear whispered, declare from the rooftops.
\v 28 "And do not fear those who kill the body but are not able to kill the soul; rather, fear Him who is able to destroy both soul and body in hell."
\v 29 "Are not two sparrows sold for a penny? And not one of them falls to the ground apart from your Father." (See footnote for cultural significance regarding the value of sparrows in the marketplace and God's care for creation.)
\v 30 But even the very hairs on your heads have all been counted.
\v 31 "Therefore, do not be afraid; you are of greater worth than many sparrows." (See footnote regarding God's intimate care for all His creation, particularly highlighting that sparrows, often seen as insignificant, are known and valued by God, thereby illustrating human dignity and value in His eyes.)
\v 32 Therefore, whoever confesses me before men, I will also confess him before my Father who is in heaven.
\v 33 But whoever denies me before men, I will also deny him before my Father who is in heaven.
\v 34 "Do not suppose that I have come to cast peace upon the earth; I did not come to cast peace, but a sword." 

*Footnote: This declaration underscores the reality that discipleship may incite conflict, especially within family units, as individuals choose their allegiance to Jesus over traditional family ties. This challenges the common perception of the Messiah solely as a peace-bringer, illustrating instead that His mission often disrupts societal norms and familial bonds in the pursuit of truth and faithfulness to Him. Moreover, the mention of 'sword' implies division and struggle that may arise as a result of one’s commitment to the Gospel, signaling a clear departure from the expectations of societal peace.*
\v 35 For I have come to bring division among a man and his father, a daughter and her mother, and a daughter-in-law and her mother-in-law.
\v 36 And a man's foes will be those of his own household.
\v 37 Whoever loves father or mother more than me is not worthy of me, and whoever loves son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me.
\v 38 And whoever does not bear his cross and follow me is unworthy of me.
\v 39 Whoever finds his own life will lose it, and whoever loses his life for my sake will find it.
\v 40 The one who welcomes you welcomes me, and the one who welcomes me welcomes the one who sent me.
\v 41 Whoever welcomes a prophet because he is a prophet will receive a prophet's reward, and whoever welcomes a righteous person because he is righteous will receive a righteous person's reward.
\v 42 And whoever gives a cup of cold water to one of these little ones in the name of a disciple, truly I say to you, he will not lose his reward.
\c 11
\p
\v 1 Now it came to pass, when Jesus had completed His instructions to the Twelve, that He departed from there to teach and preach in their cities.
\v 2 Now when John the Baptist heard in prison about the works of the Christ, he sent two of his disciples.
\v 3 John asked Him, 'Are You the One who is to come, or should we look for another?'
\v 4 And Jesus answered them, 'Go and announce to John what you hear and see:'
\v 5 The blind receive their sight, the lame walk, lepers are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead are raised, and the poor have the good news proclaimed to them.
\v 6 And blessed is the one who does not take offense at me.
\v 7 As these men were departing, Jesus began to speak to the crowds about John: 'What did you go out into the wilderness to see? A reed shaken by the wind?'
\v 8 But what did you go out to see? A man dressed in soft clothing? Look, those who wear soft garments are in the houses of kings.
\v 9 But what did you go out to see? A prophet? Verily I say unto you, and even greater than a prophet.
\v 10 For this is the one about whom it is written: 'Behold, I send my messenger before your face, who will prepare your way before you.'
\v 11 Truly, I tell you, among those born of women, there has not arisen anyone greater than John the Baptist; yet the least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he.
\v 12 "From the days of John the Baptist until now, the kingdom of heaven suffers violence, and the violent take it by force."
\v 13 For all the prophets and the Law prophesied until John.
\v 14 And if you are willing to accept it, he is the Elijah who was to come.
\v 15 Whoever has ears to hear, let him hear.
\v 16 But to what shall I compare this generation? It is like children sitting in the marketplaces and calling out to their companions,
\v 17 'We played a flute for you, and you did not dance; we sang a dirge, and you did not weep.'
\v 18 For John came, neither eating nor drinking, and they declare, 'He is possessed by a demon.'
\v 19 The Son of Man came eating and drinking, and they say, 'Behold, a man who eats and drinks, a friend of tax collectors and sinners.' Yet wisdom is justified by her children!
\v 20 He began to rebuke the cities in which most of His mighty works were done, because they did not repent.
\v 21 Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! For if the miraculous works done among you had occurred in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes.
\v 22 "But I say to you, it will be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon on the day of judgment than for you."
\v 23 And you, Capernaum, will you be exalted to heaven? You will be brought down to Hades; for if the miraculous works that were performed in you had been done in Sodom, it would have remained until this day.
\v 24 But I tell you that it will be more tolerable for the land of Sodom on the day of judgment than for you.
\v 25 At that time, Jesus answered and said, 'I praise you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because you have hidden these truths from the wise and discerning, and revealed them to little children.'
\v 26 Yes, Father, for it was your good pleasure to have it this way.
\v 27 "All things have been entrusted to me by my Father; and no one knows the Son except the Father, nor does anyone know the Father except the Son and whoever the Son wills to reveal Him."
\v 28 Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest.
\v 29 Take my yoke upon you, and learn from me, for I am gentle and humble in heart, and you will find rest for your souls.
\v 30 For my yoke is gentle, and my burden is light.
\c 12
\p
\v 1 At that time, Jesus went through the grain fields on the Sabbath, and the disciples became hungry and began to pick ears of grain and eat.
\v 2 But when the Pharisees saw it, they said to Him, 'Behold, Your disciples are doing what is not lawful to do on the Sabbath.'
\v 3 But He said to them, 'Have you not read what David did when he and those who were with him became hungry?'
\v 4 "How he entered the house of God and ate the bread of the Presence, which it was not lawful for him or those with him to eat, except for the priests alone." 

*Footnote: The 'bread of the Presence' signifies the consecrated bread placed in the Tabernacle, symbolizing the unique role of priests in worship.
\v 5 "Or have you not read in the Law that on the Sabbath the priests in the temple desecrate the Sabbath, and yet they are innocent?"
\v 6 But I say to you that that which is greater than the temple is here.
\v 7 "If you had understood what 'I desire mercy and not sacrifice' means, you would not have condemned the innocent."
\v 8 "For the Son of Man is Lord over the Sabbath." (This statement underscores Jesus' authority over the Sabbath, signifying that He embodies the true purpose of the law and offers mercy to those in need.)
\v 9 And moving on from there, He entered into their synagogue. 

*Footnote: The synagogue served as a central place of worship and teaching for the Jewish community, highlighting Jesus' authority as He engaged with both the religious leaders and the faithful within this sacred space.
\v 10 And behold, a man was there with a withered hand. And they questioned Him, saying, 'Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath?'—in order that they might accuse Him.
\v 11 But He said to them, 'Which of you, if he has one sheep, and it falls into a pit on the Sabbath, would not rescue it and lift it out?'
\v 12 How much more valuable is a man than a sheep? Therefore, it is lawful to do good on the Sabbath.
\v 13 Then He said to the man, 'Stretch out your hand.' And he stretched it out, and it was restored whole, like the other hand.
\v 14 "But the Pharisees went out and conspired against Him, that they might destroy Him." 

*Footnote: This verse illustrates the deliberate plotting of the Pharisees against Jesus, indicating their escalating hostility toward His ministry and teachings. It reflects a fundamental conflict between the compassion and authority exhibited by Jesus and the rigid legalism upheld by the Pharisees. Their actions not only signify their rejection of Jesus as the Messiah but also highlight the ongoing tension within the Gospel narrative between mercy and legalism, emphasizing the necessity of understanding Jesus’ mission in light of these opposing forces.
\v 15 But Jesus, aware of this, withdrew from there. Many crowds followed Him, and He healed them all.
\v 16 And He charged them not to make Him known.
\v 17 So that what was spoken by the prophet Isaiah might be fulfilled, saying:
\v 18 "Behold, My Servant whom I have chosen, My Beloved in whom My soul is well-pleased. I will place My Spirit upon Him, and He will declare justice to the nations."
\v 19 He will not quarrel or cry out, nor will anyone hear His voice in the streets.
\v 20 "A bruised reed He will not break, and a smoldering wick He will not extinguish, until He brings justice to victory."
\v 21 "And in His name, the nations will hope." 

*Footnote: This verse illustrates the profound expectation that the nations have in the Messiah's name, emphasizing reliance on His identity and mission for salvation, fulfilling the Messianic promises and extending hope to all peoples.
\v 22 Then a demon-possessed man who was blind and mute was brought to Him, and He healed him, so that he could both speak and see.
\v 23 And all the crowds were astonished and said, "Is this not the Christ, the Son of David?"
\v 24 But the Pharisees, hearing this, said, "This man does not cast out demons except by Beelzebul, the lord of the demons."
\v 25 But knowing their thoughts, Jesus said to them, "Every kingdom that is divided against itself will become desolate, and every city or house that is divided against itself will not endure."
\v 26 "And if Satan casts out Satan, he is divided against himself; how then will his kingdom stand?" 

*Footnote: This verse illustrates the absurdity of Satan's internal conflict, emphasizing that if he opposes his own agents, it undermines the stability of his own kingdom. This highlights the authority of Jesus in casting out demons, as it demonstrates that He operates in a realm that is united against evil.
\v 27 And if I cast out demons by Beelzebul, by whom do your children cast out demons? Therefore, they will serve as your judges.
\v 28 But if I cast out demons by the Spirit of God, then the Kingdom of God has come upon you.
\v 29 "Or how can anyone enter the house of the strong man and seize his possessions, unless he first binds the strong man? Then he will surely plunder his house." 

*Footnote: This verse highlights the necessity of confronting and overcoming spiritual strongholds to free those who are held captive, showcasing the authority that Jesus has in spiritual warfare and the triumph of His kingdom over evil.
\v 30 Whoever is not with me is against me, and whoever does not gather with me scatters.
\v 31 "Therefore, I say to you, every sin and blasphemy will be forgiven to people, but the blasphemy against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven." 

*Footnote: The blasphemy against the Holy Spirit signifies a willful and persistent rejection of the grace and work of the Holy Spirit, indicating a heart hardened against repentance and the truth of God.
\v 32 And whoever speaks a word against the Son of Man, it will be forgiven him; but whoever speaks against the Holy Spirit, it will not be forgiven him, neither in this age nor in the age to come.
\v 33 "Either make the tree good, and its fruit will be good, or make the tree corrupt, and its fruit will be corrupt; for a tree is known by its fruit."
\v 34 "Brood of vipers, how can you, who are evil, speak good words? For out of the abundance of the heart, the mouth speaks."
\v 35 The righteous man brings forth good things from his good treasure, and the wicked man brings forth evil things from his wicked treasure.
\v 36 But I say to you that every idle word that people speak, they will give an account for it on the day of judgment.
\v 37 For by your words you will be justified, and by your words you will be condemned.
\v 38 Then some of the scribes and Pharisees answered Him, saying, 'Teacher, we wish to see a sign from You.'
\v 39 But He answered and said to them, 'A wicked and adulterous generation seeks after a sign, and no sign will be given to it except the sign of Jonah the prophet.'
\v 40 For just as Jonah was in the belly of the great fish for three days and three nights, so will the Son of Man be in the heart of the earth for three days and three nights.
\v 41 The men of Nineveh will rise in judgment with this generation and condemn it, for they repented at the preaching of Jonah; look, something greater than Jonah is here.
\v 42 The queen of Sheba will stand up in judgment against this generation and will declare it guilty, for she traveled from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon; look, there is one here who is greater than Solomon.
\v 43 "When the unclean spirit has gone out of a person, it wanders through desolate places, seeking rest, but it finds none."
\v 44 Then it says, 'I will return to the house from where I came out.' And when it arrives, it finds the place idle, having been swept clean and garnished.
\v 45 Then it goes and takes with it seven other evil spirits more wicked than itself, and when they enter, they dwell there; the latter state of that man is worse than the former. So it will also be with this wicked generation.
\v 46 While He was still speaking to the crowds, behold, His mother and His brothers stood outside, desiring to speak with Him.
\v 47 And one spoke to Him, saying, 'Behold, Your mother and Your brothers stand outside, desiring to speak with You.'
\v 48 And He answered the one who spoke to Him, saying, 'Who is My mother? And who are My brothers?'
\v 49 And stretching out His hand toward His disciples, He said, 'Behold, my mother and my brothers.'
\v 50 For whoever shall do the will of My Father who is in the heavens, he is My brother, and sister, and mother.
\c 13
\p
\v 1 In that day, Jesus went out of His house and sat by the sea.
\v 2 And great crowds gathered around Him, so that He got into a boat and sat down, while all the people stood on the shore.
\v 3 And He spoke to them many things in parables, saying: "Behold, a sower went out to sow."
\v 4 And as he sowed, some seeds fell along the path, and the birds came and devoured them.
\v 5 Other seeds fell on rocky ground, where there was not much soil, and immediately sprang up because it had no depth of soil.
\v 6 But when the sun had risen, they were burned by the heat; and because they had no root, they withered away.
\v 7 Others fell among the thorns, and the thorns sprang up and choked them.
\v 8 But others fell on the good soil and yielded fruit: some a hundredfold, some sixty, and some thirty.
\v 9 Whoever has ears to hear, let him hear.
\v 10 Then the disciples approached Him and asked, 'Why do You speak to them using parables?'
\v 11 He answered them, 'To you it has been granted to understand the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, but to them it has not been granted.'
\v 12 For to the one who has, more will be given, and he will have an abundance; but from the one who does not have, even what he thinks he has will be taken away.
\v 13 Therefore, I speak to them in parables, because seeing, they do not perceive, and hearing, they do not understand.
\v 14 And in them is fulfilled the prophecy of Isaiah, saying: 'You will hear but not comprehend, and you will look but not perceive.'
\v 15 For the heart of this people has grown dull, and with their ears they have become dull of hearing, and they have closed their eyes; lest they should see with their eyes and hear with their ears and understand with their heart and turn, and I will heal them.
\v 16 But blessed are your eyes, for they see; and your ears, for they hear.
\v 17 Truly, I say to you, many prophets and righteous people longed to see what you see, and did not see it, and to hear what you hear, and did not hear it.
\v 18 Therefore, listen to the parable of the sower.
\v 19 When anyone hears the message of the kingdom and does not grasp it, the evil one comes and snatches away what was sown in his heart. This is the seed sown along the path.
\v 20 But the one sown on rocky ground is the one who hears the word and receives it immediately with joy.
\v 21 But he has no root in himself; he is temporary, and when tribulation or persecution arises because of the word, he stumbles immediately.
\v 22 But the one sown among thorns, this is the one who hears the word; and the worries of this life and the deceitfulness of riches choke the word, and he becomes unfruitful.
\v 23 But the one sown on good soil, this is the one who listens to the word and comprehends it; he indeed produces fruit, yielding a hundredfold, some sixty, and some thirty.
\v 24 He presented to them a parable, saying: 'The Kingdom of Heaven is like a man who sowed good seed in his field.'
\v 25 But while they were sleeping, his enemy came and sowed tares among the wheat, and went away. [Footnote: Tares are a type of weed that resembles wheat.]
\v 26 When the wheat sprouted and produced grain, then the weeds also appeared.
\v 27 Then the servants of the master came to him, saying, 'Lord, did you not sow good seed in your field? Where then did these tares come from?' [Footnote: Tares symbolize false believers or corruption that can arise in a community of faith.]
\v 28 But he replied to them, 'An enemy has done this.' The servants then asked him, 'Do you want us to go and gather them up?'
\v 29 But he said, 'No, so that in gathering the weeds, you do not uproot the wheat along with them.' [Footnote: 'Weeds' refers to 'tares', a type of weed that resembles wheat and symbolizes false believers or corruption in the community of faith.]
\v 30 Let both grow together until the harvest, and at the time of the harvest, I will say to the reapers: ‘First gather the weeds and bind them in bundles to be burned, but gather the wheat into my barn.'
\v 31 He told them another parable: 'The Kingdom of Heaven is like a mustard seed, which a man took and sowed in his field; it is the smallest of all seeds, but when it has grown, it is larger than all the garden plants and becomes a tree, so that the birds of the air come and nest in its branches.'
\v 32 which is the smallest of all seeds; but when it has grown, it is larger than all the garden plants and becomes a tree, so that the birds of the air come and make nests in its branches.
\v 33 He spoke another parable to them: "The Kingdom of Heaven is like yeast that a woman took and hid in three measures of flour, until it was all leavened."
\v 34 "Jesus spoke all these things to the crowds in parables; and without a parable, He did not speak to them." 

*Footnote: This verse highlights the critical role of parables in Jesus' ministry, serving as a means to convey deep truths about the Kingdom of Heaven in accessible language.
\v 35 so that what was spoken through the prophet might be fulfilled, saying: 'I will open my mouth in parables; I will proclaim things hidden since the foundation of the world.'
\v 36 Then, leaving the crowds, He went into the house. His disciples approached Him, saying, "Please explain to us the parable of the tares."
\v 37 He answered and said to them, 'The one who sows the good seed is the Son of Man.'
\v 38 The field is the world; the good seed are the children of the kingdom, but the tares are the children of the wicked one.
\v 39 The enemy who sowed them is the devil; the harvest is the end of the age, and the reapers are angels.
\v 40 Just as the tares are gathered and burned with fire, so it will be at the conclusion of this age. 

*Footnote: 'Tares' refers to weeds or undesirable plants, often used metaphorically in Scripture to signify those who do not belong to the kingdom.
\v 41 "The Son of Man will send His angels, and they will remove from His kingdom all offenses and those who commit lawlessness." 

*Footnote: 'Offenses' refers to actions or behaviors that lead others astray or create obstacles in faith, while 'those who commit lawlessness' indicates individuals who deliberately act against God's commandments, underscoring the call for moral integrity within the Kingdom.
\v 42 And they will throw them into the fiery furnace; there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.
\v 43 Then the righteous shall shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their Father. He who has ears, let him hear.

*Footnote: This verse emphasizes the glorious transformation and eternal reward awaiting the righteous in God's kingdom, illustrating the contrast between the righteous and the wicked.
\v 44 "Again, the Kingdom of Heaven is like a treasure concealed in a field, which a man, upon discovering it, hid again; and from his joy, he goes and sells all that he possesses to purchase that field." 

*Footnote: The hidden treasure symbolizes the invaluable worth of the Kingdom of Heaven, urging believers to recognize its significance and respond wholeheartedly.
\v 45 "Again, the Kingdom of Heaven is like a merchant in search of fine pearls." 

*Footnote: This verse underscores the earnest pursuit of the Kingdom of Heaven, likening it to a merchant who seeks valuable treasures. Just as the merchant diligently searches for fine pearls, believers are called to seek the Kingdom with passion and commitment, recognizing its surpassing worth. The pursuit of God's Kingdom requires sacrifice and prioritization, reminding us that true fulfillment and treasure are found in our relationship with God.
\v 46 Who, upon finding one priceless pearl, went away and sold all that he had to purchase it.
\v 47 "Again, the Kingdom of Heaven is like a net that was cast into the sea and gathered fish of every kind." 

*Contextual Note: This metaphor illustrates the gathering of people into the Kingdom, emphasizing inclusivity alongside the significant theme of impending judgment that will separate the righteous from the wicked.
\v 48 "When it was filled, they pulled the net onto the shore; and sitting down, they gathered the good fish into vessels, but threw the worthless fish away." 

*Explanatory Note: This imagery illustrates the eventual separation that will occur at the end of the age, where the righteous will be distinguished from the wicked, emphasizing the theme of divine judgment and accountability.
\v 49 So it will be at the end of the age: the angels will come forth and separate the wicked from among the righteous.
\v 50 And they will throw them into the fiery furnace; there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.
\v 51 Jesus said to them, "Have you understood all these things?" They answered Him, "Yes, Lord."
\v 52 And He said to them, "Therefore, every scribe trained for the kingdom of heaven is like a master of the house who brings forth from his treasure things both new and old."
\v 53 And it came to pass, when Jesus had finished these parables, He departed from there.

*Footnote: This moment signifies an important transition in Jesus' ministry, marking the conclusion of His teaching through parables that reveal essential truths about the Kingdom of Heaven.
\v 54 And when He came to His own country, He taught them in their synagogue, so that they were astonished and said, "From where did this man get this wisdom and these miracles?"
\v 55 Is not this the son of the carpenter? Is not His mother called Mary, and are not His brothers James, Joseph, Simon, and Judas?
\v 56 "Are not all His sisters here with us? Where then did this man gain all these things?" 

*Contextual Note: This verse reflects the local familiarity with Jesus, highlighting the crowd's astonishment at His wisdom and miraculous powers despite their knowledge of His family background. The mention of 'sisters' indicates the close-knit nature of Jesus' family, further emphasizing the crowd's incredulity regarding the source of His authority.
\v 57 And they took offense at Him. But Jesus said to them, 'A prophet is not without honor except in his own country and in his own house.'
\v 58 "And He did not do many mighty works there because of their unbelief."\n\n*Footnote: This verse emphasizes the significant impact of unbelief on the works of Jesus, illustrating how doubt can hinder divine action.

\p
\v 1 At that time, Herod the tetrarch heard reports about Jesus.
\v 2 And he said to his servants, "This is John the Baptist; he has been raised from the dead, for this reason the powers are at work in him."
\v 3 For Herod had arrested John and bound him in prison because of Herodias, his brother Philip's wife.
\v 4 For John had been telling him, 'It is not lawful for you to have her.'
\v 5 And although he wished to put him to death, he feared the crowd, because they held him to be a prophet.
\v 6 But when Herod's birthday was celebrated, the daughter of Herodias danced before them and pleased Herod.
\v 7 Therefore, he swore to her with a solemn oath, saying, 'Whatever you ask of me, I will give to you, up to half my kingdom.'
\v 8 But she, having been urged on by her mother, said, 'Give me here on a platter the head of John the Baptist.'
\v 9 And the king was deeply distressed; but because of his oaths and his guests, he commanded that it be given to her immediately.
\v 10 So he sent and had John beheaded in the prison.
\v 11 And his head was brought on a platter and given to the girl, and she brought it to her mother.
\v 12 And his disciples approached and took the body and buried it; and they informed Jesus.
\v 13 When Jesus heard about it, He withdrew from there by ship to a solitary place alone. But when the crowds heard of it, they followed Him on foot from the cities.
\v 14 And when Jesus went out, He saw a great crowd, and He was moved with compassion for them and healed their sick ones.
\v 15 As evening approached, His disciples came to Him, saying, 'The place is desolate, and the hour is already late; dismiss the crowds so that they may go into the villages and buy food for themselves.'
\v 16 But Jesus said to them, 'They do not need to go away; you give them something to eat.'
\v 17 The disciples replied to Him, 'We have here only five loaves and two fish.'
\v 18 He said, 'Bring them here to me.'
\v 19 And He commanded the crowds to recline on the grass; taking the five loaves and the two fish, He looked up to heaven and blessed them, and having broken the loaves, He gave them to His disciples, and the disciples distributed them to the crowds.
\v 20 And all ate and were filled, and they took up the leftover fragments, twelve baskets full.
\v 21 And those eating were about five thousand men, apart from women and children.
\v 22 And immediately, Jesus urged His disciples to embark on the boat and go ahead of Him to the other side of the lake, while He dismissed the crowds.
\v 23 And having dismissed the multitude, He went up to the mountain to pray; and when evening had come, He was there alone.
\v 24 But the boat was in the middle of the sea, tossed by the waves, for the wind was contrary to them.
\v 25 Now in the fourth watch of the night, Jesus went to them, walking on the sea.
\v 26 And when the disciples saw Him walking on the sea, they were troubled, saying, 'It is a ghost!' And from fear, they cried out.
\v 27 But immediately Jesus spoke to them, saying, 'Take courage! I AM; do not be afraid.' [See footnote on the significance of 'I AM' in Exodus 3:14]
\v 28 And Peter replied to Him, 'Lord, if it is You, command me to come to You upon the waters.'
\v 29 And He said, "Come." And having descended from the boat, Peter walked on the water to go to Jesus.
\v 30 Seeing the strong wind, he became afraid, and as he began to sink, he cried out, 'Lord, save me!'
\v 31 Immediately, Jesus stretched out His hand and seized him, saying, 'O you of little faith! Why did you doubt?'
\v 32 And when the disciples entered the boat, the wind immediately calmed.
\v 33 Then those who were in the boat came and worshiped Him, saying, 'Truly, You are the Son of God.'
\v 34 After they had crossed over, they arrived at the land of Gennesaret.
\v 35 And when those men of that place identified Him, they sent word throughout the whole region, and they brought to Him all who were suffering.
\v 36 And they implored Him that they might only touch the fringe of His garment. And as many as touched it were made perfectly whole.
\c 15
\p
\v 1 Then the scribes and Pharisees who had come from Jerusalem approached Jesus, saying:
\v 2 Why do Your disciples break the tradition of the elders? For they do not wash their hands when they eat bread.
\v 3 But He answered them, "And why do you also transgress the commandment of God because of your tradition?"
\v 4 For God commanded, saying, 'Honor your father and your mother'; and, 'Whoever speaks ill of his father or mother shall surely be put to death.'
\v 5 But you say, 'Whoever says to his father or mother, "If you have received any advantage from me, it is a gift," does not honor his father or mother.'
\v 6 And you have made void the commandment of God by your tradition.
\v 7 Hypocrites! Isaiah prophesied well about you, saying:
\v 8 "This people draws near to Me with their mouth and honors Me with their lips, but their heart is far from Me."
\v 9 But they worship Me in vain, teaching as doctrines the precepts of men.
\v 10 And calling the crowd, He said to them, "Listen and understand!"
\v 11 "It is not what enters the mouth that defiles a person, but rather what comes out of the mouth; this is what makes a person unclean."
\v 12 Then His disciples approached Him and said, 'Do You know that the Pharisees were offended when they heard this saying?'
\v 13 But He replied, 'Every plant that my heavenly Father has not planted will certainly be uprooted.'
\v 14 "Leave them alone; they are blind leaders of the blind. And if a blind man leads another blind man, both will fall into a pit."
\v 15 Then Peter, responding, said to Him, "Explain to us this parable."
\v 16 But Jesus said, "Are you also without understanding?"
\v 17 Do you not yet understand that whatever enters the mouth goes into the stomach and is eliminated?
\v 18 But what comes out of the mouth proceeds from the heart, and this is what defiles a person.
\v 19 For out of the heart come evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, fornications, thefts, false testimonies, and blasphemies.
\v 20 "These are the things that defile a person; but eating with unwashed hands does not defile him." [Footnote: In Jewish tradition, handwashing before meals is a significant ritual that symbolizes purity. However, Jesus emphasizes that spiritual defilement comes from within, rather than from external practices.]
\v 21 And Jesus departed from there and withdrew to the regions of Tyre and Sidon.
\v 22 And behold, a Canaanite woman from those regions came out and cried out to him, saying, "Have mercy on me, Lord, Son of David; my daughter is severely tormented by a demon."
\v 23 But He did not answer her a word. And His disciples came and urged Him, saying, "Send her away, for she cries out after us."
\v 24 But He answered and said, "I was sent only to the lost sheep of the house of Israel."
\v 25 But she came and worshiped Him, kneeling down, saying, "Lord, please help me!"
\v 26 But He answered, "It is not good to take the bread of the children and give it to the little dogs." [Footnote: The term 'little dogs' refers to domesticated pets, which illustrates the Jewish view of the Gentiles. In this context, Jesus' response serves to highlight the priority of His mission to Israel while also demonstrating the woman's remarkable faith, which transcends cultural boundaries.]
\v 27 But she said, 'Yes, Lord; even the dogs eat the crumbs that fall from their masters' table.' [Footnote: The term 'dogs' in this context refers to domesticated animals, highlighting the woman's humble acknowledgment of her status in relation to the Jewish audience while reflecting her remarkable faith. In Jewish culture, dogs were considered unclean animals, yet the woman's response indicates her understanding of Jesus' mission and her desperation for help.]
\v 28 Then Jesus answered her, 'O woman, great is your faith! Let it be done for you as you desire.' And her daughter was healed from that very hour.
\v 29 And moving on from there, Jesus came by the Sea of Galilee, and after going up onto the mountain, He sat down there.
\v 30 And great crowds came to Him, bringing with them the lame, the blind, the mute, the crippled, and many others; and they laid them down at Jesus’ feet, and He healed them.
\v 31 So the crowds were amazed, seeing the mute speaking, the crippled restored, the lame walking, and the blind seeing; and they glorified the God of Israel.
\v 32 Then Jesus called His disciples to Him and said, 'I feel deep compassion for this crowd, for they have been with Me for three days and have nothing to eat. I do not want to send them away hungry, lest they faint on the journey.'
\v 33 And His disciples said to Him, 'From where could we possibly find enough bread in this wilderness to satisfy such a large multitude?' [Footnote: This question reveals the disciples' struggle to understand Jesus' ability to provide in dire circumstances, reflecting their journey of faith and reliance on His power amidst their doubts. Despite having witnessed His previous miracles, they remain uncertain about how to meet the needs of the crowd in such a desolate place.]
\v 34 And Jesus said to them, 'How many loaves do you have?' They said, 'Seven, and a few small fish.'
\v 35 And He commanded the crowds to recline on the ground. [Footnote: Reclining during meals in the cultural context of the time symbolized a communal gathering, where individuals shared not just food, but fellowship and community. This act illustrates Jesus’ desire to bring the crowd into a shared experience, highlighting the importance of togetherness in His ministry.]
\v 36 And having taken the seven loaves and the fish, He blessed them, broke them, and gave them to His disciples; and the disciples distributed them to the crowds. [Footnote: This act of blessing emphasizes the miraculous nature of Jesus' provision, showcasing His divine authority and compassion as He meets the needs of the people.]
\v 37 And they all ate and were satisfied, and they took up the leftover fragments, seven baskets full. [Footnote: The gathering of seven baskets full signifies the abundance of God's provision through Jesus, reflecting His compassion for the people and the miraculous nature of the meal, highlighting His divine authority in meeting their needs. The number seven often symbolizes completeness in biblical texts.]
\v 38 Now those who ate were four thousand men, besides women and children.
\v 39 And He sent the crowds away, He entered the boat and went to the region of Magdala. [Footnote: Magdala, known for its fishing industry, was a notable location on the western shore of the Sea of Galilee and reflects the continued ministry of Jesus in the region.]
\c 16
\p
\v 1 "And the Pharisees and Sadducees approached Him, testing Him, and asked Him to show us a sign from heaven." [Footnote: The Pharisees and Sadducees were influential religious authorities who often challenged Jesus' legitimacy. Their request for a heavenly sign illustrates their skepticism towards His authority.]
\v 2 But He answered them, "When evening comes, you say, 'It will be fair weather, for the sky is red.'"
\v 3 And in the morning, you say, 'Today will be stormy, for the sky is gloomy.' You know how to interpret the appearance of the sky, but you cannot discern the signs of the times.
\v 4 "A wicked and adulterous generation seeks a sign. No sign will be given to it, except the sign of Jonah the prophet." And He left them and departed. [Footnote: The 'sign of Jonah' refers to Jonah's three days in the belly of the fish, which foreshadows Jesus' own death and resurrection (see Matthew 12:40).]
\v 5 And when His disciples came to the other side, they had forgotten to bring bread.
\v 6 But Jesus said to them, "Take heed and beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees."
\v 7 But they were discussing among themselves, saying, "It is because we have not brought any bread."
\v 8 But Jesus, knowing their thoughts, said to them, "Why are you thinking within yourselves, O you of little faith, that you did not take any bread?"
\v 9 "Do you not yet comprehend or recall the five loaves for the five thousand, and how many baskets you collected?" [Footnote: This question underscores the disciples' struggle with spiritual insight, highlighting the importance of understanding and memory in relation to faith and Jesus' miraculous provision.]
\v 10 "Nor the seven loaves for the four thousand, and how many baskets did you gather?" [Footnote: The seven loaves for the four thousand highlight Jesus' miraculous provision and serve as a reminder of His authority over physical needs, underscoring the importance of faith in recognizing His identity.]
\v 11 "How do you not understand that I said to you, 'Take heed of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees,' not concerning bread?" [Footnote: 'Leaven' symbolizes the corrupting influence of the Pharisees and Sadducees' teachings.]
\v 12 Then they understood that He was not warning them to beware of the leaven of bread, but of the teachings of the Pharisees and Sadducees.
\v 13 And when Jesus came into the region of Caesarea Philippi, He asked His disciples, 'Who do men say that the Son of Man is?'
\v 14 And they said, 'Some say John the Baptist, others say Elijah, and still others say Jeremiah or one of the prophets.'
\v 15 He said to them, 'But who do you say that I am?'
\v 16 Simon Peter responded, "You are the Christ, the Son of the Living God."
\v 17 And Jesus answered him, "Blessed are you, Simon, son of Jonah, for this was not revealed to you by flesh and blood, but by My Father who is in heaven." [Footnote: 'Blessed are you' emphasizes the special favor from God due to Peter's insight, which transcends human understanding.]
\v 18 And I say to you that you are Peter, and upon this rock I will build My church, and the gates of Hades will not overpower it.
\v 19 And I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven; whatsoever you bind on earth shall be bound in heaven, and whatsoever you loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.
\v 20 Then He commanded His disciples not to tell anyone that He was the Christ.
\v 21 From that time onward, Jesus began to reveal to His disciples that He must go to Jerusalem and suffer many things from the elders, chief priests, and scribes, and be killed, and on the third day rise again.
\v 22 And Peter took Him aside and began to rebuke Him, saying, 'Let this not be so, Lord; this shall never happen to You!'
\v 23 But He turned and said to Peter, "Get behind Me, Satan! You are a stumbling block to Me, for you are not considering the things of God, but the things of men."
\v 24 Then Jesus said to His disciples, "If anyone wants to follow Me, let him deny himself, take up his cross, and follow Me."
\v 25 For whoever wishes to save his life will lose it; but whoever loses his life for my sake will find it. [Note: This verse emphasizes the paradox of Christian discipleship, illustrating that true life is found through self-denial in following Christ.]
\v 26 For what will it profit a man if he gains the whole world but loses his own soul? Or what will a man give in exchange for his soul?
\v 27 For the Son of Man is about to come in the glory of His Father with His angels, and then He will repay each one according to his works. [Footnote: This verse highlights the impending final judgment and the individual accountability of each person before God, emphasizing the necessity of living a life reflective of one’s faith.]
\v 28 "Truly, I say to you, there are some standing here who will not taste death until they see the Son of Man coming in His kingdom." 

[Contextual Note: This verse underscores the immediacy of Jesus' proclamation about His kingdom, foreshadowing the coming revelation of His glory in the transfiguration. It invites reflection on the anticipation of witnessing God's reign in Christ.]
\c 17
\p
\v 1 After six days, Jesus took Peter, James, and John, his brother, and led them up a high mountain by themselves.
\v 2 And He was transfigured before them; His face shone like the sun, and His clothes became white like light.
\v 3 And behold, they saw Moses and Elijah talking with Him. 

[Contextual Note: The appearance of Moses and Elijah signifies the fulfillment of the Law and the Prophets in Jesus. Moses represents the Law, given to guide God's people, while Elijah embodies the prophetic tradition, pointing towards the coming Messiah. Their presence affirms Jesus’ authority and mission as the culmination of God's redemptive plan.]
\v 4 Responding, Peter said to Jesus, 'Lord, it is good for us to be here. If You wish, let us make three tabernacles here—one for You, one for Moses, and one for Elijah.' 

[Contextual Note: Peter's suggestion reflects a desire to prolong this sacred encounter and connect it to Jewish tradition, symbolizing God's presence among His people.]
\v 5 While he was still speaking, a bright cloud overshadowed them, and behold, a voice out of the cloud said, 'This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased; hear him!'
\v 6 And when the disciples heard this, they fell on their faces to the ground and were terrified.
\v 7 And Jesus came and touched them, saying, 'Rise, and do not fear.'
\v 8 And raising their eyes, they beheld no one but Jesus only.
\v 9 And as they were coming down from the mountain, Jesus commanded them, saying, 'Tell no one about the sight that you have seen until the Son of Man has risen from the dead.'
\v 10 And His disciples asked Him, 'Why then do the scribes say that Elijah must come first?'
\v 11 And Jesus answered them, 'Amen, Elijah is coming first and will restore all things.'
\v 12 But I say to you, Elijah has already come, and they did not know him; rather, they did to him whatever they wanted. In the same way, the Son of Man is destined to suffer at their hands.
\v 13 Then the disciples understood that He was speaking about John the Baptist. [Footnote: This connection between Elijah and John the Baptist highlights John's role in fulfilling the prophetic expectation of Elijah's return.]
\v 14 "And when they came to the crowd, a man kneeling before Him said, 'Lord, have mercy on my son.'" (Footnote: Kneeling was a common expression of respect and supplication in ancient Jewish culture.)
\v 15 "Lord, have mercy on my son, for he is epileptic and severely afflicted; for he often falls into the fire and often into the water." (Footnote: The term 'epileptic' reflects a condition historically believed to be influenced by lunar cycles, similar to what was once termed 'moonstruck.')
\v 16 "And I brought him to the disciples, but they were unable to heal him."
\v 17 Jesus replied, 'O unbelieving and perverse generation! How long must I be with you? How long must I put up with you? Bring the boy here to Me.'
\v 18 And Jesus rebuked him, and the demon came out of him, and the boy was healed from that very hour.
\v 19 Then the disciples approached Jesus privately and said, 'Why could we not cast it out?'
\v 20 And Jesus said to them, 'Because of your unbelief. Truly, I say to you, if you have faith as a mustard seed, you will say to this mountain, “Move from here to there,” and it will move, and nothing will be impossible to you.'
\v 21 However, this kind does not go out except by prayer and fasting.
\v 22 As they were journeying through Galilee, Jesus said to them, 'The Son of Man is about to be handed over to men.' [Footnote: This statement highlights the impending betrayal and suffering of Jesus, aligning with the prophetic Scriptures regarding the Messiah's mission and foreshadowing his redemptive suffering and resurrection.]
\v 23 and they will kill him, and on the third day he will be raised up.' And they were greatly distressed.
\v 24 "When they arrived in Capernaum, the collectors of the temple tax, which was two drachmas, approached Peter and asked, 'Does your teacher not pay the temple tax?'"
\v 25 He said, 'Yes.' And when he entered the house, Jesus spoke to him first, saying, 'What do you think, Simon? From whom do the kings of the earth collect taxes? From their own sons or from others?'
\v 26 Peter replied, 'From others.' Jesus said to him, 'Then the sons are free.'
\v 27 But to avoid scandalizing them, go to the sea, cast a fishing hook, and take the first fish that comes up. When you open its mouth, you will find a stater; take that and give it to them as payment for you and me. [Footnote: A stater was a silver coin equivalent to four didrachmas, used in the ancient world for temple tax.]
\c 18
\p
\v 1 At that time, the disciples approached Jesus, asking, 'Who is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven?'
\v 2 And Jesus summoned a little child and placed him in their midst.
\v 3 Truly, I say to you, unless you turn and become as little children, you will not enter the kingdom of heaven. [Footnote: Emphasizes the necessity of repentance and childlike faith for entering the kingdom of God.]
\v 4 Therefore, whoever humbles himself like this child is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven.
\v 5 And whoever welcomes one such child in my name welcomes me.
\v 6 But whoever causes one of these little ones who believe in me to stumble, it would be better for him to have a heavy millstone hung around his neck and to be drowned in the depths of the sea.
\v 7 "Woe to the world because of scandals! For it is necessary that temptations come; but woe to that man through whom the scandal comes!"
\v 8 "And if your hand or your foot causes you to stumble, cut it off and throw it away. It is better for you to enter into eternal life maimed or lame than to have two hands or two feet and be cast into the eternal fire."
\v 9 And if your eye causes you to stumble, pluck it out and cast it away from you; for it is better for you to enter into life having one eye than to have two eyes and be cast into the fiery Gehenna.
\v 10 "Take care not to despise one of these young ones; for I tell you that their angels in heaven always behold the face of my Father who is in heaven."
\v 11 For the Son of Man has come to seek and save that which was lost.
\v 12 "What is your opinion? If a man has a hundred sheep and one of them goes astray, does he not leave the ninety-nine on the mountains and go in search of the one that has gone astray?"
\v 13 And if he finds it, Amen, I say to you, he rejoices with greater joy over it than over the ninety-nine who have not gone astray. [Footnote: This parable illustrates God's immense love for each individual, emphasizing the joy in salvation and restoration of the lost.]
\v 14 Thus, it is not the will of the heavenly Father that one of these little ones should be lost.
\v 15 If your brother sins against you, go and tell him his fault, between you and him alone; if he listens to you, you have gained your brother.
\v 16 But if he does not listen, take one or two others along with you, that every word may be confirmed by the testimony of two or three witnesses.
\v 17 If he refuses to hear them, tell it to the church; and if he disregards the church, let him be to you like an unbeliever and a tax collector.
\v 18 "Truly, I say to you, whatever you bind on earth shall be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven." [Footnote: The terms 'bind' and 'loose' refer to the authority given to the church to make decisions regarding doctrinal and disciplinary matters, reflecting their significance in aligning actions with God's will.]
\v 19 Again, I tell you that if two of you agree on earth concerning anything they ask, it will come to pass for them by my Father in heaven.
\v 20 For where two or three are gathered in my name, there I am in their midst.
\v 21 Then Peter came up to Him and said, 'Lord, how often shall my brother sin against me, and I forgive him? Up to seven times?'
\v 22 Jesus said to him, "I do not say to you up to seven times, but up to seventy times seven."
\v 23 Therefore, the kingdom of heaven is like a king who desired to settle accounts with his servants.
\v 24 As he began to settle accounts, there was brought to him a servant who owed him ten thousand talents.
\v 25 But since he could not pay, his master commanded that he be sold, along with his wife and children, and all that he had, so that payment could be made.
\v 26 Falling on his knees, the servant begged him, saying, 'Lord, be patient with me, and I will repay you everything.'
\v 27 Moved with compassion, the master of that servant released him and forgave his debt.
\v 28 So that servant went out and found one of his fellow servants who owed him a hundred denarii; and seizing him, he demanded, 'Please repay what you owe!'
\v 29 So his fellow servant fell down at his feet and implored him, saying, 'Be patient with me, and I will repay you.'
\v 30 But he refused and went away, and he cast him into prison until he should pay what was owed.
\v 31 When his fellow servants saw what had occurred, they were greatly distressed and went to report to their master all that had happened.
\v 32 Then his master summoned him and said to him, 'You wicked servant! I forgave you all that debt because you pleaded with me.'
\v 33 'Should you not also have shown compassion to your fellow servant, as I had compassion on you?'
\v 34 And in anger, his master delivered him to the tormentors until he should repay all that was owed.
\v 35 "So also will my heavenly Father do to you, if each of you does not forgive your brother from your hearts his offenses."
\c 19
\p
\v 1 Now it came to pass, when Jesus had finished these sayings, He departed from Galilee and went to the borders of Judea, beyond the Jordan.
\v 2 And large crowds followed Him, and He healed them there.
\v 3 And the Pharisees approached Him, testing Him, and saying, 'Is it lawful for a man to dismiss his wife for any cause?'
\v 4 He answered them, 'Have you not read that He who created them from the beginning made them male and female,'
\v 5 "For this reason, a man shall leave his father and mother and cleave to his wife, and they become one flesh."
\v 6 So they are no longer two, but one flesh. Therefore, what God has joined together, let not man separate.
\v 7 They said to Him, 'What then did Moses command to give a certificate of divorce and to divorce her?'
\v 8 He said to them, 'Moses permitted you to divorce your wives because of the hardness of your hearts; but it was not so from the beginning.'
\v 9 And I say to you, whoever dismisses his wife, except on the ground of sexual immorality, and marries another, commits adultery; and whoever marries a woman who has been dismissed commits adultery.
\v 10 The disciples said to Him, 'If this is the condition regarding a man and his wife, it is better not to marry.'
\v 11 But He said to them, 'Not everyone is able to accept this teaching, but only those to whom it has been granted.'
\v 12 For there are eunuchs who were born that way from their mother's womb; and there are eunuchs who have been made eunuchs by men; and there are eunuchs who have made themselves eunuchs for the Kingdom of Heaven. He who is able to accept this, let him accept it.
\v 13 Then little children were brought to Him, so that He might lay His hands on them and pray; but the disciples forbade them.
\v 14 But Jesus said, "Let the little children come to me and do not hinder them, for the kingdom of heaven belongs to such as these."
\v 15 And He laid His hands on them and went from there.\n\n*Note: This act signifies Jesus' blessing and care for the children, highlighting their value in the Kingdom of Heaven.
\v 16 And a young man approached Him and said, 'Good Teacher, what must I do to inherit eternal life?'
\v 17 But He said to him, 'Why do you call Me good? Only God is good. If you want to enter into eternal life, observe the commandments.'
\v 18 He said to him, 'Which ones?' Jesus replied, 'You shall not murder; you shall not commit adultery; you shall not steal; you shall not bear false witness.'
\v 19 "Honor your father and your mother, and you shall love your neighbor as yourself." 

*Note: This commandment, as found in Exodus 20:12 and Leviticus 19:18, highlights the importance of family and community relationships in the ethical framework of the Old Testament.
\v 20 The young man said to Him, "These commandments have I observed from my youth; what do I still lack?"
\v 21 Jesus said to him, 'If you want to be perfect, go, sell your possessions and give to the poor, and you will find treasure in heaven; then, come, follow Me.'

*Footnote: This instruction reflects the radical call of discipleship, emphasizing that true following of Christ may require sacrifice of material wealth, highlighting the contrast between earthly riches and heavenly treasure.
\v 22 But when the young man heard the words of Jesus, he went away sorrowful, for he had great wealth.
\v 23 But Jesus said to His disciples, "Truly I say to you, it is hard for a rich person to enter the kingdom of heaven."
\v 24 "Again I tell you, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich person to enter the kingdom of God." 

*Context: This verse illustrates the difficulty wealthy individuals may face in prioritizing spiritual matters over material possessions, underscoring the Christian teaching that true discipleship often involves sacrifice and detachment from earthly wealth.
\v 25 When the disciples heard this, they were exceedingly astonished and said, "Who then can be saved?"
\v 26 But Jesus looked at them and said, "With men, this is not possible, but with God, all things are possible."
\v 27 Then Peter answered and said to Him, "Behold, we have forsaken all and followed You. What then will our reward be?"
\v 28 And Jesus said to them, "Truly I say to you, you who have followed Me will sit on twelve thrones in the regeneration, when the Son of Man sits on His glorious throne. You will judge the twelve tribes of Israel." 

*Footnote: 'Regeneration' refers to the anticipated future renewal and restoration of creation as articulated in Christian eschatology, highlighting the transformative nature of God's kingdom.
\v 29 "And everyone who has left houses or brothers or sisters or father or mother or wife or children or fields for the sake of My name will receive a hundredfold and will inherit eternal life."
\v 30 "And many who are first will be last, and the last will be first." 

*Footnote: This statement underscores a profound truth about the values of the Kingdom of Heaven, where societal status and expectations are inverted. In God's economy, those who are regarded as esteemed may find themselves in humble positions, while those who serve with humility are exalted. This principle challenges believers to reflect on their own attitudes towards greatness and service, emphasizing that true discipleship in Christ involves a reversal of earthly expectations, leading to a life characterized by humility and sacrificial love.

\p
\v 1 "For the kingdom of heaven is like a householder who went out early in the morning to hire laborers for his vineyard." 

*Footnote: This parable illustrates the nature of God's kingdom and His desire to include all people in His work, highlighting themes of grace and generosity.
\v 2 And having agreed with the laborers for a denarius for the day, he sent them into his vineyard.
\v 3 And having gone out about the third hour, he saw others standing idle in the marketplace.
\v 4 And he said to them, 'Go into the vineyard as well, and I will give you what is right.'
\v 5 They went out again. About the sixth and the ninth hour, he did the same.
\v 6 "And about the eleventh hour, he went out and found others idle, and he said to them, 'Why have you remained here idle all day?'"
\v 7 They answered Him, 'No one has hired us.' He said to them, 'Go into the vineyard too, and you will receive what is just.'
\v 8 When evening had come, the owner of the vineyard said to his steward, ‘Call the laborers and render them their wages, starting from the last to the first.’
\v 9 And those who came about the eleventh hour received a denarius each.
\v 10 But when the first came, they assumed they would receive more, yet they also received each a denarius.
\v 11 And upon receiving their payment, they began to complain against the landowner.
\v 12 saying, 'These last worked only one hour, and you have made them equal to us, who have borne the burden of the day and the heat of the sun.'
\v 13 But he answered one of them, 'Friend, I do you no wrong; did we not agree on a denarius?'
\v 14 'Take what is yours and go; I wish to give to this last one as I have given to you.'
\v 15 'Is it not lawful for me to do as I wish with what belongs to me? Or is your eye evil because I am good?'
\v 16 "So the last will be first, and the first last; for many are called, but few chosen."
\v 17 And as Jesus was ascending to Jerusalem, He took His twelve disciples aside privately on the road and said to them:
\v 18 Behold, we are going up to Jerusalem, and the Son of Man shall be delivered to the chief priests and the scribes, and they shall condemn Him to death.
\v 19 and they will deliver Him to the Gentiles to be ridiculed, scourged, and crucified; and on the third day, He shall rise again.
\v 20 Then the mother of James and John, the sons of Zebedee, approached Him, kneeling and asking Him, 'Let these two sons of mine sit, one at Your right and one at Your left in Your kingdom.'
\v 21 And He said to her, 'What do you wish?' She said to Him, 'Grant that these two sons of mine may sit, one on Your right hand and the other on Your left, in Your kingdom.'
\v 22 But Jesus answered and said, 'You do not know what you are asking. Are you able to drink the cup that I am about to drink, or be baptized with the baptism with which I am to be baptized?' They said to Him, 'We are able.'
\v 23 And He said to them, 'You will indeed drink from My cup and be baptized with the baptism with which I am to be baptized; but sitting at My right and left hand is not for Me to grant, but is for those whom My Father has prepared.'
\v 24 "And when the ten heard this, they became greatly indignant against the two brothers."
\v 25 But Jesus called them to Himself and said, 'You know that the rulers of the Gentiles exercise authority over them, and their great ones govern them.'
\v 26 It will not be this way among you; rather, whoever wishes to be great among you must become your servant.
\v 27 And whoever desires to be first among you shall be your servant.
\v 28 Just as the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give His life as a ransom for many.
\v 29 And as they were going out from Jericho, a great multitude followed Him.
\v 30 Look, two blind men were sitting by the roadside, and when they heard that Jesus was passing by, they called out, saying, 'Lord, Son of David, show mercy to us!'
\v 31 But the crowd rebuked them, telling them to be silent; yet they cried out all the more, 'Lord, Son of David, have mercy on us!'
\v 32 And Jesus stood still and called to them, saying, 'What is it that you wish for Me to do for you?'
\v 33 They said to Him, 'Lord, that our eyes might be opened.'
\v 34 Moved with compassion, Jesus touched their eyes; immediately their sight was restored, and they followed Him.
\c 21
\p
\v 1 And as they approached Jerusalem, and came into the village of Bethphage at the Mount of Olives, then He sent two of His disciples.
\v 2 saying to them, 'Go into the village that is opposite you, and immediately you will find a donkey tied, and a colt with her; untie them and bring them to Me.'
\v 3 And if anyone says anything to you, you shall say, 'The Lord has need of them'; and immediately he will send them.
\v 4 This all took place to fulfill what was spoken by the prophet Zechariah, saying.
\v 5 Say to the daughter of Zion, ‘Behold, your king is coming to you, gentle and riding on a donkey, on a colt, the foal of a donkey.’
\v 6 And the disciples went and did according to His command.
\v 7 They brought the donkey and the colt to Jesus, and they laid their cloaks upon the colt; and He sat upon it.
\v 8 And many in the crowd laid their cloaks on the road, while others cut branches from the trees and laid them along the way.
\v 9 And the crowds that went before Him and those following were shouting, 'Hosanna to the Son of David! Blessed is He who comes in the name of the Lord! Hosanna in the highest!.'
\v 10 And when he entered Jerusalem, the whole city was stirred, asking, 'Who is this?'
\v 11 And the crowds were saying, 'This is Jesus, the prophet from Nazareth of Galilee.'
\v 12 And Jesus entered the temple of God and forcefully drove out all those who were selling and buying in the temple, and He overturned the tables of the money changers and the seats of those selling doves.
\v 13 And He said to them, 'It is written, ‘My house shall be called a house of prayer’; but you have made it a den of thieves.'
\v 14 And the blind and the lame came to Him in the temple, and He healed them.
\v 15 But when the chief priests and the scribes saw the wonderful works that He performed, and the children shouting in the temple and saying, 'Hosanna to the Son of David!' they became angry.
\v 16 And they said to Him, 'Do You hear what these are saying?' Jesus replied, 'Yes, have you never read this: "Out of the mouths of infants and nursing babies, You have perfected praise?"'
\v 17 And leaving them, He went out of the city to Bethany and spent the night there.
\v 18 Early in the morning, as He was returning to the city, He became hungry.
\v 19 And seeing a fig tree by the road, He approached it, but found nothing on it except leaves. And He said to it, 'May you never bear fruit again!' Immediately, the fig tree withered away.
\v 20 And when the disciples saw it, they marveled, saying, 'How did the fig tree wither away immediately?'
\v 21 But Jesus answered them, 'I assure you, if you have faith and do not waver, you will not only do what was done to the fig tree, but if you say to this mountain with faith, 'Be taken up and thrown into the sea,' it will happen.'
\v 22 And whatever you ask in prayer, believing, you will receive.
\v 23 And when He entered the temple, the chief priests and the elders of the people approached Him as He was teaching, asking, 'By what authority are You doing these things? And who granted You this authority?'
\v 24 Jesus replied to them, 'I will pose one question to you; if you answer me, I will tell you by what authority I am doing these things.'
\v 25 "From where does the baptism of John come? From heaven or from people?" They deliberated among themselves, saying, "If we say, 'From heaven,' He will ask us, 'Then why did you not believe him?'"
\v 26 And if we say, 'From men,' we are afraid of the crowd, for all consider John to be a prophet.
\v 27 And they answered Jesus, 'We do not know.' Jesus then replied to them, 'Neither will I disclose to you by what authority I am performing these deeds.'
\v 28 "What do you think? A certain man had two sons, and he went to the first and said, 'Son, go work in my vineyard today.'" 

*Footnote: In biblical culture, vineyards were not only vital for agricultural production but also held deep symbolic meaning, often representing God's kingdom and the work required within it.*
\v 29 But he answered, 'I will not.' Yet later, having changed his mind, he went to work in the vineyard.
\v 30 And going to the second son, he said the same thing. The son replied, 'I will, Lord,' but he did not go.
\v 31 "Which of the two did the will of his father?" They replied, "The first." Jesus said to them, "Amen, I say to you, that tax collectors and prostitutes are going into the kingdom of God before you."
\v 32 For John came to you in the way of righteousness, and you did not believe him; but the tax collectors and prostitutes believed him. And even after seeing this, you did not repent and believe him.
\v 33 "Hear another parable: There was a certain owner of a vineyard who planted a vineyard, enclosed it, dug a winepress in it, and built a tower. Then he entrusted it to farmers and went away."
\v 34 When the time for the harvest drew near, he sent his servants to the tenants to collect his fruit.
\v 35 And the tenants took his servants; they beat one, killed another, and stoned a third.
\v 36 Again, he sent more servants than the first, and they treated them in the same way.
\v 37 Afterward, he sent his son to them, saying, 'They will respect my son.'
\v 38 But when the farmers saw the son, they said to one another, 'This is the heir; come, let us kill him and seize his inheritance.'
\v 39 And they took him, threw him out of the vineyard, and killed him.
\v 40 Therefore, when the lord of the vineyard comes, what will he do to those farmers?
\v 41 They said to Him, 'He will bring ruin upon those wicked men and give the vineyard to other farmers, who will render to Him the fruits in their seasons.'
\v 42 Jesus said to them, 'Have you never read in the Scriptures: The stone which the builders rejected has become the cornerstone? This was the Lord's doing, and it is marvelous in our eyes?'
\v 43 "Therefore, I say to you that the kingdom of God will be taken away from you and given to a people who will produce its fruits."
\v 44 And the one who falls upon this stone will be broken; but on whomever it falls, it will grind him to powder.
\v 45 And when the chief priests and the Pharisees heard His parables, they realized that He was referring to them.
\v 46 And they sought to seize Him, but they feared the multitude, since they held Him as a prophet.
\c 22
\p
\v 1 And Jesus answered and spoke to them again in parables, saying:
\v 2 The kingdom of heaven is like a king who prepared a wedding feast for his son.
\v 3 And he sent his servants to call those invited to the wedding feast, but they were not willing to come.
\v 4 Again he sent other servants, saying, 'Behold, I have prepared my marriage supper; my oxen and the fatted calf are slaughtered, and everything is ready. Come to the marriage supper!'
\v 5 But they disregarded the invitation and went away, one to his own farm and another to his trade.
\v 6 But the others seized his servants, mistreated them, and killed them.
\v 7 But when the king heard this, he became enraged. He sent his forces to destroy the murderers and set their city on fire.
\v 8 Then he said to his servants, 'The wedding feast is ready, but the invited guests were not worthy.'
\v 9 Go therefore to the intersections of the roads, and invite as many as you find to the wedding feast.
\v 10 And those servants went out into the streets and gathered all whom they found, both bad and good; and the wedding hall was filled with guests.
\v 11 But when the king entered to observe the guests, he beheld a man not wearing a wedding garment.
\v 12 And he said to him, ‘Friend, how did you get in here without wedding clothes?’ And the man was speechless.
\v 13 Then the king said to the servants, 'Bind his hands and feet, take him away, and cast him out into the outer darkness; there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.'
\v 14 For many are invited, but few are chosen.
\v 15 Then the Pharisees went and conspired to entrap Him in His speech.
\v 16 And they sent their disciples to Him, along with the Herodians, saying, 'Teacher, we know that You are true and teach the way of God in truth; for You do not regard the person of men.'
\v 17 Therefore, tell us your opinion: Is it permissible to pay taxes to Caesar, or not?
\v 18 But Jesus, knowing their wickedness, said, 'Why do you test me, you hypocrites?'
\v 19 "Show Me the coin for the tax."
\v 20 And He asked them, 'Whose likeness and inscription is this?'
\v 21 They said to Him, 'Caesar's.' Then He said to them, 'Therefore, render to Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's.'
\v 22 And hearing this, they were astonished; and they left Him and went away.
\v 23 On that day, the Sadducees came to Him, those who say there is no resurrection, and they asked Him.
\v 24 saying, "Teacher, Moses said that if a man dies without children, his brother must marry his brother's wife and raise up seed for his brother."
\v 25 There were seven brothers. The first married and died, and having no offspring, he left his wife to his brother.
\v 26 Likewise, the second and the third, until all seven.
\v 27 Finally, after them all, the woman also died.
\v 28 In the resurrection, whose wife will the woman be? For all seven had her as a wife.
\v 29 "Jesus answered and said to them, 'You are mistaken, not knowing the Scriptures, nor the power of God.'"
\v 30 For in the resurrection, they neither marry nor are given in marriage, but are like angels of God in heaven.
\v 31 Concerning the resurrection of the dead, have you not read what God spoke to you in the Scriptures?
\v 32 "I am the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. God is not the God of the dead, but of the living."
\v 33 And when the multitudes heard this, they were astonished at His teaching.
\v 34 But when the Pharisees heard that He had silenced the Sadducees, they gathered together.
\v 35 And one of the Pharisees, a lawyer, inquired of Him, intending to test Him, saying,
\v 36 "Teacher, which is the great commandment in the Law?"
\v 37 "Love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your mind."
\v 38 "This is the first and greatest commandment."
\v 39 "The second is like it: You shall love your neighbor as yourself."
\v 40 On these two commandments depend all the Law and the Prophets.
\v 41 While the Pharisees were assembled, Jesus asked them.
\v 42 He asked them, 'What do you think about the Christ? Whose son is he?' They said to him, 'The son of David.'
\v 43 He said to them, 'How then does David, in the Spirit, call him Lord, saying,
\v 44 "The LORD said to my Lord, 'Sit at My right hand until I place Your enemies under Your feet.'"
\v 45 If, then, David calls Him Lord, how can He be his son?
\v 46 And no one was able to answer Him a word, nor did anyone dare to question Him anymore from that day forward.
\c 23
\p
\v 1 Then Jesus spoke to the crowds and to His disciples.
\v 2 saying, 'The scribes and the Pharisees have taken their seat in the seat of Moses.'
\v 3 Therefore, all that they tell you to observe, you must keep and do; but do not follow their actions, for they say and do not practice.
\v 4 For they bind heavy burdens and lay them on the shoulders of men, but are unwilling to lift a finger to help them.
\v 5 But all their works they do to be seen by men. They broaden their phylacteries and lengthen the tassels of their garments.
\v 6 They love the seats of honor at feasts and the most prominent seats in the synagogues.
\v 7 and they love greetings in the marketplaces and to be called Rabbi by men.
\v 8 But you are not to be called 'Rabbi,' for you have one Teacher, the Christ; and all of you are brothers.
\v 9 And do not call anyone on earth your father, for you have one Father, who is in heaven.
\v 10 And do not be called teachers, for you have one Teacher, the Christ.
\v 11 But the greatest among you shall be your servant.
\v 12 Whoever lifts himself up will be brought low, and whoever lowers himself will be raised up.
\v 13 Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you devour the houses of widows, and for a show make long prayers. Therefore, you will receive the greater judgment.
\v 14 Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you shut the door to the kingdom of heaven in front of men; for you do not enter yourselves, nor do you allow those who are trying to enter to go in.
\v 15 Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you traverse land and sea to make one proselyte, and when he is made, you make him twice as much a son of hell as yourselves.
\v 16 Woe to you, blind guides! For you say, 'Whoever swears by the temple, it is nothing; but whoever swears by the gold of the temple is bound.'
\v 17 Foolish and blind! Which is greater, the gold or the temple that sanctifies the gold?
\v 18 And whoever swears by the altar, it is nothing; but whoever swears by the gift that is upon it, is obligated.
\v 19 What is greater: the gift or the altar that sanctifies the gift?
\v 20 Therefore, the one who swears by the altar swears by it and by all that is upon it.
\v 21 And he who swears by the temple swears by it and by Him who dwells in it.
\v 22 And he who swears by heaven swears by the throne of God and by Him who sits upon it.
\v 23 Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you tithe the mint, dill, and cumin, but you have neglected the weightier matters of the law: justice, mercy, and faith. These are the things you ought to have done, while still observing the others.
\v 24 Blind guides! You strain out a gnat but swallow a camel!
\v 25 Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you cleanse the outside of the cup and of the dish, but inside they are full of extortion and injustice.
\v 26 Cleanse first the inside of the cup and of the dish, that the outside may also become clean, you blind Pharisee!
\v 27 Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you are like whitewashed tombs, which indeed appear beautiful outwardly, but inside are full of dead bones and all uncleanness.
\v 28 Thus, you also appear outwardly righteous to others, but within, you are filled with hypocrisy and lawlessness.
\v 29 Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you build the tombs of the prophets and decorate the monuments of the righteous.
\v 30 And you say, 'If we had lived in the days of our forefathers, we certainly would not have been companions in the bloodshed of the prophets.'
\v 31 Thus, you testify against yourselves that you are descendants of those who murdered the prophets.
\v 32 And so you are completing the measure of your forefathers.
\v 33 Serpents, offspring of vipers! How will you escape from the judgment of Gehenna?
\v 34 Therefore, behold, I send you prophets, wise men, and scribes; some of them you will kill and crucify, and some of them you will scourge in your synagogues and chase from city to city.
\v 35 so that all righteous blood shed on the earth will come upon you, from the blood of Abel, the righteous, to the blood of Zechariah, son of Barachiah, whom you murdered between the sanctuary and the altar.
\v 36 Truly, I say to you, all these things will come upon this generation.
\v 37 O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, you who are responsible for killing the prophets and stoning those sent to you! How often I have longed to gather your children together, as a hen gathers her chicks under her wings; yet you were not willing!
\v 38 Behold, your house is left to you desolate.
\v 39 For I tell you, you will not see me again until you say, 'Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.'
\c 24
\p
\v 1 And Jesus went out of the temple; and his disciples approached him to show him the buildings of the temple.
\v 2 But Jesus said to them, "Do you not see all these things? Truly, I say to you, not one stone will be left here upon another, which will not be thrown down."
\v 3 While He was sitting on the Mount of Olives, the disciples approached Him privately, saying, 'Tell us, when will these things be, and what will be the sign of Your coming and of the end of the age?'
\v 4 And Jesus answered and said to them, "Take heed that no one deceives you." 

**Commentary**: This verse serves as a vital reminder for believers to remain vigilant against deception and false teachings. Jesus underscores the importance of discernment, encouraging His followers to be aware of those who may come in His name yet lead others astray. In the face of increasing falsehoods, maintaining a firm grasp on truth is essential for faithfulness in the Christian walk.
\v 5 For many will come in my name, declaring, 'I am the Christ,' and they will lead many astray.
\v 6 And you will hear of wars and rumors of wars. See that you are not troubled, for these things must happen, but the end is not yet.
\v 7 For nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom, and there will be famines, plagues, and earthquakes in various places.
\v 8 All these are just the beginning of birth pains.
\v 9 Then they will deliver you into tribulation and will kill you, and you will be hated by all nations because of my name.
\v 10 "At that time, many will be led into offense, and they will betray one another and hate one another." 

**Commentary**: In this verse, Jesus forewarns His disciples of a time of great moral and spiritual turmoil. The phrase 'led into offense' highlights the risk of believers turning away from their faith under pressure, leading to betrayals within the community. This reflects a profound warning about the fragility of human relationships and the trials that may test the bonds of love and loyalty among His followers. Such trials are part of the broader eschatological discourse that emphasizes the need for vigilance and perseverance in faith.
\v 11 "And many false prophets will arise and will deceive many."
\v 12 And because lawlessness will increase, the love of many will grow cold.
\v 13 But the one who perseveres to the end will be saved.
\v 14 "And this gospel of the kingdom will be preached throughout the entire world as a witness to all nations, and then the end will come."
\v 15 "So when you see the abomination of desolation spoken of by the prophet Daniel standing in the holy place—whoever reads, let him understand—"
\v 16 Then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains.
\v 17 Let the one who is on the housetop not go down to take anything out of his house.
\v 18 And let the one who is in the field not turn back to take his cloak.
\v 19 But woe to those who are pregnant and to those who are nursing infants in those days.
\v 20 Pray that your escape may not occur in winter or on the Sabbath.
\v 21 "For then there will be a great tribulation, such as has not occurred since the beginning of the world until now, nor will ever occur."
\v 22 "And if those days were not shortened, no flesh would be saved; but the days will be shortened for the benefit of the elect."
\v 23 "Then if anyone says to you, 'Look, here is the Christ!' or 'There He is!' do not believe them."
\v 24 For false Christs and false prophets will arise, and they will perform great signs and wonders, so as to lead astray, if possible, even the chosen ones.
\v 25 "Behold, I have warned you beforehand."
\v 26 Therefore, if anyone says to you, 'Look, He is in the wilderness,' do not go out; or, 'Look, He is in the inner rooms,' do not believe them.
\v 27 For as lightning comes from the east and flashes to the west, so will be the coming of the Son of Man.
\v 28 For wherever the corpse may be, there will the eagles be gathered together.
\v 29 Immediately after the tribulation of those days, the sun will be darkened, and the moon will not give its light; the stars will fall from the heavens, and the powers of the heavens will be shaken.
\v 30 And then the sign of the Son of Man will appear in heaven, and all the tribes of the earth will mourn; and they will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of heaven with great power and glory.
\v 31 "And He will send His angels with a loud trumpet call, and they will gather the elect from the four winds, from one end of the heavens to the other." 

*Note: In this context, 'angels' refers to divine messengers of God tasked with gathering the elect, emphasizing the urgency of this final assembly. 'The elect' signifies those chosen by God for salvation, highlighting their significance in eschatological events.
\v 32 Now learn this lesson from the fig tree: When its branch becomes tender and its leaves sprout, you know that summer is near.
\v 33 So, when you see all these things, understand that He is near, right at the door.
\v 34 Truly, I say to you, this generation will not pass away until all these things take place.
\v 35 Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will never pass away.
\v 36 But concerning that day and hour, no one knows, neither the angels in heaven nor the Son, but only my Father alone.
\v 37 But just as the days of Noah were, so will be the coming of the Son of Man.
\v 38 For just as they were in the days before the flood, eating and drinking, marrying and being given in marriage, until the day Noah entered the ark,
\v 39 And they did not realize it until the flood came and took them all away; so will it be at the coming of the Son of Man.
\v 40 Then two will be in the field; one will be taken, and one will be left.
\v 41 Two women will be grinding at the mill; one will be taken and one will be left. 

*Footnote: The term 'taken' signifies selection for salvation, while 'left' indicates a state of unpreparedness and impending judgment. This contrast emphasizes the essential need for vigilance and faithfulness in one's responsibilities, highlighting the importance of being prepared for the return of Christ.
\v 42 Therefore, stay alert, for you do not know at what hour your Lord is coming.
\v 43 But this you must understand, that if the householder had known at what time the thief was coming, he would have stayed awake and not allowed his house to be broken into.
\v 44 Therefore, you must be ready, for at an hour you do not expect, the Son of Man comes.
\v 45 Who then is the faithful and wise servant, whom his master has set over his household, to give them their food at the proper time?
\v 46 Blessed is that servant whom his master finds faithfully fulfilling his responsibilities when he arrives.

*Footnote: This verse emphasizes the critical importance of vigilance and faithfulness in our assigned duties, reflecting the expectation that believers should be prepared for the return of Christ.
\v 47 Truly, I tell you, he will put him in charge of all his belongings.
\v 48 But if that wicked servant says in his heart, 'My lord delays to come,'
\v 49 And that evil servant will begin to beat his fellow servants, and he will eat and drink with the drunkards.
\v 50 The master of that servant will come on a day when he does not expect him, and at an hour he does not know.
\v 51 "And he will cut him in two and will place him with the hypocrites; there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth."  

*Note: This verse serves as a stark warning about the severe judgment that awaits the unfaithful servant, underscoring the eternal consequences of neglecting one's duties. The phrase 'cut him in two' symbolizes ultimate separation from the faithful, while being placed among 'hypocrites' signifies exclusion from the community of believers. The imagery of 'weeping and gnashing of teeth' highlights the anguish of those facing such judgment, emphasizing the critical need for vigilance and faithfulness as believers are called to be prepared for the return of Christ.

\v 1 Then the kingdom of heaven will be like ten virgins who took their lamps and went out to meet the bridegroom.
\v 2 "Five of them were wise, and five were foolish." 

*Footnote: The term 'foolish' in this context highlights a lack of spiritual preparedness and discernment, serving as a warning about the consequences of neglecting one's readiness for the bridegroom's coming.
\v 3 "The foolish virgins took their lamps, yet they did not bring oil with them." 
*Footnote: The absence of oil represents a lack of spiritual preparedness, highlighting the crucial themes of vigilance and readiness in anticipation of the bridegroom's coming, as echoed in Matthew 24:44 and Luke 12:35-40.
\v 4 "But the wise took extra oil with their lamps." 
*Footnote: The inclusion of 'extra oil' signifies the importance of spiritual preparedness and readiness. In the parable, oil symbolizes the necessary resources and faith required to sustain one's spiritual life in anticipation of the bridegroom's arrival.
\v 5 While the bridegroom was delayed, all the virgins became drowsy and fell asleep. 
*Note: This drowsiness signifies a lapse in spiritual vigilance, highlighting the critical necessity for preparedness in anticipation of the bridegroom's arrival.
\v 6 At midnight, a loud shout was heard: 'Look, the bridegroom is coming; go out to meet him!'
\v 7 Then all those virgins arose and trimmed their lamps.
\v 8 And the foolish said to the wise, 'Please give us some of your oil, for our lamps are going out.'
\v 9 "But the wise answered, 'We cannot share our oil with you, for there may not be enough for both us and you. Instead, go to those who sell oil and buy some for yourselves.'" 
*Note: This response emphasizes the importance of individual preparedness in faith, reminding us that one’s relationship with God is personal and cannot be shared or borrowed.
\v 10 But while they had gone away to purchase oil, the bridegroom came, and the wise virgins entered with him into the wedding feast, and the door was shut.
\v 11 Later, the other virgins arrived, crying, 'Lord, Lord! Open for us!'
*Footnote: This urgent plea illustrates the desperate condition of the foolish virgins, emphasizing their failure to prepare for the bridegroom's arrival. The repetition of 'Lord, Lord!' signifies their recognition of authority and reflects their critical need for assistance. This moment serves as a poignant reminder within the parable of the necessity for spiritual vigilance and readiness.
\v 12 But he answered, 'Truly I say to you, I do not know you.'
\v 13 Therefore, be vigilant, for you do not know the day or the hour when the Son of Man will come.
\v 14 For it will be like a man going on a journey, who called his own servants and entrusted to them his possessions.
\v 15 "To one he entrusted five talents, to another two, and to another one, each according to his own ability; and he departed immediately." 
*Explanatory Note: In this passage, the master, representing God, entrusts his servants with varying amounts of talents, signifying the diverse gifts and resources given to each individual. This parable underscores the responsibility of stewardship, highlighting that these gifts should be utilized faithfully for the advancement of God's purposes.
\v 16 Then he who had received the five talents went and traded with them, and made five more talents.
\v 17 Likewise, the one who had received two talents gained two more.
\v 18 "But the one who had received the single talent went away, dug in the earth, and hid his master's talent."
*Footnote: This action symbolizes a failure in stewardship, highlighting the responsibility to actively use and multiply the gifts entrusted by God.
\v 19 After a long time, the master of those servants returned and settled accounts with them.
\v 20 And he who had received the five talents approached, bringing five talents more, saying, 'Master, you entrusted me with five talents; see, I have gained five talents more.' 
*Footnote: This response illustrates the faithful stewardship of the servant, who not only returned what was entrusted but also multiplied it, reflecting the expectation of diligence and responsibility in God's kingdom.
\v 21 His master said to him, 'Well done, good and faithful servant! You were faithful over a little; I will set you over much. Enter into the joy of your lord.'
\v 22 "And he who had received the two talents came forward, saying, 'Master, you entrusted me with two talents; look, I have earned two more.'" 
*Explanatory Note: This declaration highlights the servant's faithfulness in stewardship, actively working to multiply the resources entrusted to him, thus exemplifying the expectation of diligence and accountability in God's kingdom.
\v 23 His Lord said to him, 'Well done, good and faithful servant! You were faithful over a little; I will appoint you over much. Enter into the joy of your Lord.'
\v 24 Then he who had received the one talent approached and said, 'Master, I know you to be a hard man, reaping where you did not sow and gathering where you scattered no seed.'
\v 25 And filled with fear, I went away and hid your talent in the ground; look, here you have what is yours.
\v 26 But his master answered him, ‘You wicked and slothful servant! You knew that I reap where I have not sown and gather where I have not scattered seed!'
\v 27 Then you should have placed my money with the bankers, and upon my arrival, I would have earned back what was mine with interest.
\v 28 "Therefore, take the talent from him and give it to the one who possesses ten talents." 
*Footnote: This command underscores the biblical principles of stewardship and the necessity of responsibility in managing God-given resources, highlighting the consequences of faithfulness and neglect.
\v 29 For to everyone who has, more will be given, and he will have an abundance; but from the one who does not have, even what he has will be taken away from him.
\v 30 And cast out the worthless servant into the outer darkness; there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.
\v 31 When the Son of Man comes in His glory, and all the holy angels with Him, then He will sit on His glorious throne.
\v 32 And before Him will be gathered all the nations, and He will separate them one from another, just as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats.
\v 33 And He will place the sheep on His right hand, but the goats on His left.
\v 34 Then the King will say to those on His right, ‘Come, you blessed of My Father; inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world.
\v 35 For I was hungry, and you gave Me food; I was thirsty, and you gave Me drink; I was a stranger, and you took Me in.
\v 36 "When I was naked, you clothed me; when I was sick, you visited me; when I was in prison, you came to me." 
*Footnote: This verse emphasizes the Christian imperative to show compassion to those in need, illustrating that our treatment of others, especially the marginalized, reflects our service to Christ.
\v 37 Then the righteous will answer him, saying, 'Lord, when did we see you hungry and feed you, or thirsty and give you something to drink?'
\v 38 When did we see you as a stranger and take you in, or see you naked and provide clothing for you?
\v 39 When did we see you sick or in prison, and come to you?
\v 40 And the King will answer them, 'Truly, I say to you, as you did it to one of the least of these my brothers, you did it to me.'
\v 41 Then he will say to those on his left, 'Depart from me, you cursed ones, into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels.'
\v 42 For I was hungry, and you did not give me anything to eat; I was thirsty, and you did not give me anything to drink.
\v 43 "I was a stranger, and you did not take me in; I was naked, and you did not clothe me; I was sick and in prison, and you did not visit me."
\v 44 Then they will also answer Him, saying, 'Lord, when did we see You hungry, or thirsty, or a stranger, or naked, or sick, or in prison, and did not minister to You?'
\v 45 Then He will respond to them, saying, 'Truly I say to you, as much as you did not do it for one of the least of these, you did not do it for Me.'
\v 46 And these will go away into eternal punishment, but the righteous into eternal life.
\c 26
\p
\v 1 When Jesus had finished all these words, He addressed His disciples,
\v 2 You know that after two days the Passover is coming, and the Son of Man will be betrayed to be crucified.
\v 3 Then the chief priests, the scribes, and the elders of the people gathered together in the courtyard of the high priest, who was called Caiaphas.
\v 4 And the chief priests and the elders of the people conspired together to seize Jesus by deceit and to kill Him.
\v 5 But they said, 'Not during the festival, lest there be an uproar among the people.'
\v 6 And Jesus, having come to Bethany, was in the house of Simon, a leper.
\v 7 A woman came to Him, holding an alabaster jar of very costly ointment, and she poured it upon His head while He was reclining at the table.
\v 8 But when His disciples saw it, they became outraged, saying, 'Why this waste?'
\v 9 For this perfume could have been sold for many denarii and given to the poor.
\v 10 But Jesus, knowing this, said to them, "Why do you bother the woman? For she has performed a good work for Me."
\v 11 For you always have the poor with you, but you do not always have Me.
\v 12 For when she poured this oil on My body, she did it to prepare Me for burial.
\v 13 Truly, I say to you, wherever this gospel is preached throughout the whole world, what she has done will also be told in remembrance of her.
\v 14 Then one of the twelve, named Judas Iscariot, went to the chief priests and said to them,
\v 15 "What will you pay me to betray Him to you?" And they paid him thirty pieces of silver.
\v 16 And from that time, he began to seek an opportunity to betray Him.
\v 17 On the first day of Unleavened Bread, the disciples came to Jesus, saying to Him, 'Where do You desire that we prepare for You to eat the Passover?'
\v 18 But He said, 'Go into the city to a certain man and tell him, "The Teacher says: My time is near; I will keep the Passover at your house with My disciples."'
\v 19 And the disciples did as Jesus had instructed them, and they made ready the Passover.
\v 20 Now when evening had come, He reclined at the table with the twelve.
\v 21 And while they were eating, He said, "Truly, I say to you, one of you will betray Me."
\v 22 And they were deeply grieved, and began to ask Him, each, 'Is it I, Lord?'
\v 23 But He answered, 'He who has dipped his hand with Me in the dish, he will betray Me.'
\v 24 The Son of Man is going as it has been written about Him. Woe to that man through whom the Son of Man is betrayed! It would have been better for that man if he had not been born.
\v 25 Judas, the one betraying Him, replied, 'Surely, it is not I, Rabbi?' Jesus said to him, 'You have said it yourself.'
\v 26 While they were eating, Jesus took bread, and after giving thanks, He broke it and gave it to His disciples, saying, 'Take and eat; this is my body.'
\v 27 And Jesus, having taken the cup, and after giving thanks, gave it to them, saying, 'Drink from it, all of you.'
\v 28 For this is My blood of the new covenant, which is poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins.
\v 29 But I tell you, I will not drink from this fruit of the vine from now until that day when I drink it anew with you in my Father’s kingdom.
\v 30 And after they had sung a hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives.
\v 31 Then Jesus said to them, "All of you will fall away because of Me this night, for it is written: 'I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock will be scattered.'"
\v 32 But after I have been raised, I will go ahead of you to Galilee.
\v 33 Peter answered Him, 'Even if all others fall away because of You, I will never stumble.'
\v 34 Jesus replied, 'Truly, I say to you, this very night, before the rooster crows, you will deny Me three times.'
\v 35 Peter said to Him, 'Even if I must die with You, I will never deny You.' And all the disciples said the same.
\v 36 Then Jesus went with them to a place called Gethsemane, and he said to his disciples, 'Sit here while I go over there and pray.'
\v 37 And taking Peter and the two sons of Zebedee with Him, He began to be sorrowful and troubled.
\v 38 Then Jesus said to them, 'My soul is sorrowful to the point of death. Remain here and watch with me.'
\v 39 And going a little farther, He fell on His face and prayed, saying, 'My Father, if it is possible, let this cup pass from me; yet not as I will, but as You will.'
\v 40 And He came to the disciples and found them sleeping; and He said to Peter, 'Could you not stay awake with Me for one hour?'
\v 41 "Watch and pray, that you may not enter into temptation; the spirit is eager, but the flesh is frail."
\v 42 Again, He went away a second time and prayed, saying, 'My Father, if this cup cannot pass from Me unless I drink it, let Your will be done.'
\v 43 And coming back, He found them again sleeping; for their eyes were heavy.
\v 44 And having left them, He went away again and prayed the same prayer for the third time.
\v 45 Then He came to His disciples and said to them, 'Sleep on and take your rest! Behold, the hour has come, and the Son of Man is being betrayed into the hands of sinners.'
\v 46 'Get up! Let us go; behold, the betrayer is near.'
\v 47 And while He was still speaking, behold, Judas, the betrayer, one of the twelve, arrived; and with him came a large multitude, armed with swords and clubs, sent by the chief priests and the elders of the people.
\v 48 "He who betrays Him gave them a sign, saying, 'The one I kiss is He; seize Him.'"
\v 49 And immediately, approaching Him, he said, 'Greetings, Rabbi,' and then kissed Him.
\v 50 But Jesus said to him, 'Friend, why have you come?' Then they came forward, laid hands on Jesus, and arrested Him.
\v 51 And behold, one of those who were with Jesus stretched out his hand and drew his sword, and striking the servant of the high priest, he cut off his ear.
\v 52 Then Jesus said to him, 'Sheathe your sword; for all who draw the sword will perish by the sword.'
\v 53 "Or do you think that at this moment I cannot call upon my Father, and He would immediately send me more than twelve legions of angels?"
\v 54 How then shall the Scriptures be fulfilled, that it must be accomplished in this manner?
\v 55 At that hour, Jesus said to the crowds, 'Have you come out to arrest me as though you were apprehending a thief, with swords and clubs? I sat daily teaching in the temple, and you did not seize me.'
\v 56 "But all of this has happened so that the Scriptures of the prophets may be fulfilled." Then all the disciples abandoned Him and fled.
\v 57 Then they seized Jesus and brought Him to the high priest Caiaphas, where the scribes and the elders had gathered.
\v 58 But Peter followed Him from a distance, as far as the courtyard of the high priest; and having entered, he sat down with the attendants to see the outcome.
\v 59 Now the chief priests, the elders, and the entire Sanhedrin were seeking false witnesses against Jesus in order that they might put Him to death.
\v 60 But they found no witnesses; and many false witnesses approached. Then, two false witnesses came forward.
\v 61 This man said, 'I am able to destroy the temple of God and rebuild it in three days.'
\v 62 And arising, the high priest said to Him, 'Will You not answer? What is this testimony these men bring against You?'
\v 63 But Jesus remained silent. Then the high priest stood up and said to Him, 'I solemnly adjure you by the living God: tell us if you are the Christ, the Son of God.'
\v 64 Jesus said to him, 'You have said it. However, I say to you, from now on you will see the Son of Man seated at the right hand of the Power of God and coming on the clouds of heaven.'
\v 65 Then the high priest rent his robes, saying, 'He has blasphemed! What further need do we have for witnesses? Behold, now you have heard his blasphemy!'
\v 66 "What is your verdict?" They answered, "He is guilty of death."
\v 67 Then they spat upon His face, struck Him with blows, and others slapped Him.
\v 68 saying, "Prophesy to us, Christ! Who struck you?"
\v 69 Now Peter was sitting outside in the courtyard. And a certain servant girl approached him and said, 'You also were with Jesus of Galilee.'
\v 70 But he denied it in front of them all, saying, "I do not know what you are saying."
\v 71 As he went out to the gateway, another servant girl saw him and said to those nearby, 'This man was surely with Jesus of Nazareth.'
\v 72 And again he denied it with an oath, saying, 'I do not know the man.'
\v 73 After a little while, those who stood nearby approached Peter and said, 'Truly, you are one of them; for your accent reveals you.'
\v 74 Then he began to call down curses upon himself and swore, saying, 'I do not know the man!' And immediately, the rooster crowed.
\v 75 And Peter remembered the word Jesus had spoken to him: 'Before the rooster crows, you will deny me three times.' And going outside, he wept bitterly.
\c 27
\p
\v 1 As morning dawned, all the chief priests and the elders of the people took counsel against Jesus to put Him to death.
\v 2 And after binding Him, they led Him away and handed Him over to Pontius Pilate, the governor.
\v 3 Then Judas, who had betrayed Him, seeing that He was condemned, was filled with remorse and returned the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and the elders.
\v 4 saying, 'I have sinned, betraying innocent blood.' But they said, 'What is that to us? You see to it.'
\v 5 And casting the silver coins in the temple, he went away and hanged himself.
\v 6 But the chief priests took the silver coins and said, 'It is not lawful to put these into the treasury, since it is the price of blood.'
\v 7 And after taking counsel, they bought the potter's field with the silver, for a burial place for strangers.
\v 8 Therefore, that field was called the Field of Blood until this day.
\v 9 Then was fulfilled what was spoken through the prophet Jeremiah, saying: 'And they took the thirty pieces of silver, the price of Him who was valued, whom they valued from among the sons of Israel.'
\v 10 And they delivered these into the potter's field, as the Lord commanded me.
\v 11 But Jesus stood before the governor. And the governor asked Him, saying, 'Are You the King of the Jews?' Jesus said to him, 'It is as you say.'
\v 12 And to the accusations made against Him by the chief priests and the elders, He did not answer a single word.
\v 13 Then Pilate said to Him, 'Do you not hear how many things they testify against you?'
\v 14 And He did not respond to him with a single word, and the governor was greatly astonished.
\v 15 Now during the feast, it was customary for the governor to release to the people one prisoner of their choice.
\v 16 Then there was a well-known prisoner named Barabbas.
\v 17 So when they had gathered together, Pilate said to them, 'Whom do you want me to release to you? Barabbas or Jesus, who is called the Christ?'
\v 18 For he knew that it was out of envy that they had delivered Him over.
\v 19 As he sat on the judgment seat, his wife sent him a message, saying, 'Have nothing to do with the Righteous One, for today I have suffered greatly in a dream because of Him.'
\v 20 But the chief priests and the elders persuaded the crowds to demand Barabbas and to condemn Jesus to death.
\v 21 The governor replied to them, 'Which of the two do you want me to release to you?' They said, 'Barabbas.'
\v 22 Pilate said to them, 'What then shall I do with Jesus who is called Christ?' They all answered, 'Let Him be crucified!'
\v 23 But the governor asked, 'What wrong has He done?' And they shouted all the more, 'Let Him be crucified!'
\v 24 When Pilate saw that he was getting nowhere, but rather that the crowd was becoming more tumultuous, he took water and washed his hands before the crowd, saying, 'I am innocent of the blood of this righteous man; you yourselves are responsible for it.'
\v 25 And all the people answered, ‘His blood be on us and on our children.’
\v 26 Then he released Barabbas to them; but after having Jesus whipped, he handed Him over to be crucified.
\v 27 Then the soldiers of the governor took Jesus into the praetorium and gathered the whole battalion against Him.
\v 28 And stripping Him of His garments, they dressed Him in a scarlet robe.
\v 29 And they wove a crown from thorns and placed it upon His head, and they put a reed in His right hand. Then, kneeling before Him, they mocked Him, saying, 'Hail, King of the Jews!'
\v 30 And they spat on Him, took the staff, and struck Him on the head.
\v 31 And after they had mocked Him, they stripped Him of the scarlet robe and clothed Him in His own garments; then they led Him away in order to crucify Him.
\v 32 As they were going out, they came upon a man of Cyrene named Simon; they compelled him to carry His cross.
\v 33 And when they came to a place called Golgotha, that is, the place of a skull.
\v 34 They gave Him to drink vinegar mixed with gall; and having tasted it, He did not choose to drink.
\v 35 And after they had crucified Him, they divided His clothing among themselves by casting lots, fulfilling the prophecy: 'They divided My garments among themselves, and for My clothing they cast lots.' (Psalm 22:18)
\v 36 And they sat down and kept watch over Him there.
\v 37 And they placed above His head the charge against Him, which was written: This is Jesus, the King of the Jews.
\v 38 Then there were two robbers crucified with Him, one on the right and one on the left.
\v 39 And those who passed by blasphemed Him, shaking their heads in contempt.
\v 40 And saying, "You who are destroying the temple and in three days rebuilding it, save Yourself! If You are the Son of God, come down from the cross!"
\v 41 Likewise, the chief priests, deriding Him along with the scribes and elders, said,
\v 42 "He has saved others; He cannot save Himself. If He is the King of Israel, let Him now come down from the cross, and we will believe in Him."
\v 43 "He trusts in God; let God save Him now, if He desires Him; for He said, 'I am the Son of God.'"
\v 44 The robbers who were crucified with Him also reviled Him.
\v 45 Now from the sixth hour, darkness fell over all the land until the ninth hour.
\v 46 About the ninth hour, Jesus cried out with a loud voice, saying, "My God, My God, why have You forsaken Me?" (Transliteration: "Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani?")  

*Contextual Note: This profound cry from Jesus reflects His deep sense of forsakenness as He bears the weight of humanity's sin, echoing the lament of Psalm 22:1. This moment underscores the fulfillment of Scripture and the profound mystery of the Incarnation, where Christ experiences the fullness of human suffering.
\v 47 Some of those standing there, upon hearing it, said, 'This man is calling for Elijah!'
\v 48 And immediately, one of those standing there ran and took a sponge, filled it with vinegar, and put it on a stick to give Him a drink.
\v 49 But the others said, 'Let us see if Elijah comes to save him.'
\v 50 But Jesus, once more crying out with a loud voice, yielded up His spirit.
\v 51 Then, the curtain of the temple was torn in two from top to bottom; and the earth shook, and the rocks were split.
\v 52 "And the tombs were opened, and many bodies of the saints who had died were raised."  

*Contextual Note: This event symbolizes Jesus' victory over death, highlighting the promise of resurrection and eternal life for believers.
\v 53 And coming out of the tombs after His resurrection, they entered the holy city and appeared to many.
\v 54 But the centurion and those who were with him, watching over Jesus, when they saw the earthquake and all that had happened, were filled with great fear, saying, 'Truly, this was the Son of God!'
\v 55 And there were many women there, observing from a distance, who had followed Jesus from Galilee, serving Him.
\v 56 Among those women was Mary Magdalene, and the mother of James and Joseph, and the mother of the sons of Zebedee.
\v 57 When evening had come, a rich man named Joseph, who had become a disciple of Jesus, came from Arimathea to take down the body of Jesus.
\v 58 This man went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus.
\v 59 And taking the body, Joseph wrapped it in a clean linen cloth.
\v 60 and laid it in his own new tomb, which he had hewn out of the rock. And he rolled a large stone to the entrance of the tomb and went away.
\v 61 And there were Mary Magdalene and the other Mary sitting opposite the tomb.
\v 62 The next day, which is after the Preparation, the chief priests and the Pharisees gathered together before Pilate.
\v 63 saying, 'Sir, we remember that this deceiver said, ‘After three days I will rise.’
\v 64 Therefore, command that the tomb be secured until the third day, lest His disciples come by night and steal Him away and say to the people, 'He has risen from the dead.' For the last deception would be worse than the first.
\v 65 Pilate said to them, "You have a guard; go, secure it as you know how."
\v 66 So they went and secured the tomb, sealing the stone with the guard.
\c 28
\p
\v 1 After the Sabbath, at dawn on the first day of the week, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary came to see the tomb.
\v 2 And lo, a great earthquake occurred; for an angel of the Lord descended from heaven, approached the stone, rolled it away from the entrance, and sat upon it.
\v 3 His appearance resembled lightning, and his clothing was white as snow.
\v 4 And because of their fear, the guards trembled and became as if they were dead.
\v 5 But the angel said in response to the women, "Do not be afraid; for I know that you seek Jesus, who was crucified."
\v 6 He is not here; for He has risen, just as He said. Come, see the place where the Lord lay.
\v 7 And go swiftly, tell His disciples that He has risen from the dead; behold, He is going ahead of you into Galilee; there you will see Him. I have told you.
\v 8 And they quickly departed from the tomb with fear and great joy, and ran to tell His disciples.
\v 9 As they were going to tell His disciples, behold, Jesus met them, saying, "Rejoice!" And the women approached, held onto His feet and reverently worshipped Him.
\v 10 Then Jesus said to them, 'Do not be afraid; go and tell my brothers to go to Galilee; there they will see me.'
\v 11 Behold, while they were going, some of the soldiers came into the city and reported to the chief priests all that had taken place.
\v 12 And when they had assembled with the elders, they took counsel and gave a large sum of silver to the soldiers, saying,
\v 13 "Say that His disciples came by night and took Him away while we were asleep."
\v 14 And if this should be heard before the Roman governor, we will persuade him and keep you without care.
\v 15 So they took the silver and did as they were instructed. And this report has been widely circulated among the Jews to this day.
\v 16 And the eleven disciples went to Galilee, to the designated mountain where Jesus had directed them.
\v 17 And when they saw Him, they worshipped Him, and some of them doubted.
\v 18 And Jesus approached them and spoke, saying, 'All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me.'
\v 19 Going, make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit,
\v 20 Teaching them to observe all that I have commanded you. And behold, I am with you always, even to the end of the age. Amen.
