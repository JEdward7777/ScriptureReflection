\v 1 One night, a man named Nicodemus, who was part of a group called the Pharisees, came to see Jesus. Pharisees were people who helped others understand God’s rules. Nicodemus was really curious about Jesus and wanted to learn more about Him, so he decided to visit quietly at night.
\v 2 One night, Nicodemus, a Pharisee who was a respected teacher, quietly came to see Jesus. He said, 'Teacher, we know that you are sent by God because of the amazing things you do. Only someone sent by God can perform these incredible miracles! I really want to learn more about you and what you teach.'
\v 3 Jesus replied, "Listen to me! To be a part of God's special family and really know His love, you must trust in Me and ask God to help you change inside. This is what it means to be 'born again.' It’s like starting a brand new life where the Holy Spirit comes into your heart and helps you grow in love and happiness. God wants you to be filled with His joy and share it with others!"
\v 4 Nicodemus asked Jesus, "How can a person be born again when they are already old? Can they go back into their mother's belly and be born a second time?"
\v 4-5 Nicodemus was confused and asked, "How can someone who is old be born again? Can they really go back into their mom's tummy?" Jesus answered, "Listen closely! To be part of God’s family, you need to be born in a new way. This happens when you trust Me, Jesus, and get baptized in water. When you do this, God’s Spirit comes into your heart to help you grow and change. Just like a caterpillar turns into a beautiful butterfly, you get a new life filled with God’s love!"
\v 6 "When a baby is born, it comes from its mom. But when we believe in Jesus, something wonderful happens! God’s Spirit comes into our hearts and makes us new. This means we can feel God's love and learn to love others better. Being part of God's family means trusting in Jesus, who helps us change and be happy every day!"
\v 7 "Don’t be surprised that I told you, 'You need to be born again' to be close to God. This means you need to trust in Me, Jesus, and let the Holy Spirit come into your heart to help you change. Just like a caterpillar becomes a beautiful butterfly, when you believe in Me, you start a new life filled with God’s love and joy!"
\v 8 "The Holy Spirit is like the wind. You can feel it blowing all around, but you can’t see where it comes from or where it goes. When you believe in Jesus, the Holy Spirit comes into your heart and starts to change you. Just like a seed grows into a tree, the Holy Spirit helps you grow in love and joy! This means you can become a better friend and share God’s love with others. Trusting in Jesus means letting the Holy Spirit work in your heart to help you be who God wants you to be!"
\v 9 Nicodemus was really curious and asked Jesus, 'How can a person start over with God? What does it mean to be born again? I want to know how trusting you can change my life!'
\v 10 Jesus said, "Nicodemus, you are a teacher for God's people, so it's surprising that you don't understand how much God loves everyone! This is very important for you to know because you help others learn about God. Keep asking questions, Nicodemus! Understanding God's love is the best way to teach others and grow closer to Him!"
\v 11 I tell you the truth, we are sharing what we know and what we have seen, but you don’t believe our message.
\v 11-12 "Listen closely! I’m telling you the truth about God. We talk about the things we know and the amazing things we have seen, but many people don’t believe what we say. If you can’t believe the simple things I tell you about life on Earth, how will you believe the incredible things that come from Heaven? Trusting in Me, Jesus, is very important because it helps you understand how much God loves you and everyone!"
\v 13 "Only Jesus, who is called the Son of Man (this means He is like us and also comes from God), came down from Heaven to show us how we can be saved. He helps us understand God’s amazing love and shows us how to make good choices. When we trust in Him, He leads us to love others and be close to God forever!"
\v 14 "Just like Moses lifted up a snake on a stick in the desert so that people could look at it and be healed, Jesus will be lifted up on the cross to forgive our sins. This shows how much Jesus loves us and wants us to be close to God forever! When we believe in Jesus, we can feel His love and the forgiveness that helps us start fresh with God!"
\v 15 "So everyone who believes in Jesus will be saved and have a close friendship with God forever! When we trust Him, He forgives our wrong choices and fills our hearts with love. This means we can be happy and know that we will always be with Him! Believing in Jesus opens the door to a wonderful life with God, where we learn to love and care for others, just like He loves us!"
\v 16 "God loves everyone so much that He gave us His only Son, Jesus, to die for our sins. This means Jesus took the punishment for all the wrong things we do. When we believe in Jesus and want to be His friend, we are forgiven, and we can be close to God forever! Believing in Jesus helps us feel His love every day, and we know that we will always be with Him!"
\v 17 "God didn’t send Jesus into the world to point fingers at our mistakes or to judge us like a teacher scolding a student. Instead, Jesus came to rescue us, like a lifeguard who jumps in to save someone in trouble. When we believe in Him, it’s like holding His hand so He can pull us to safety! God loves every single person and wants us all to be happy and safe with Him forever! Trusting in Jesus means we can leave our mistakes behind and feel God’s amazing love in our hearts every day!"
\v 18 "When you believe in Jesus, it's like being part of a super fun party where everyone loves and cares for each other! But if you don’t believe in Him, it’s like standing outside the party while everyone inside is happy. God wants you to trust in Jesus so you can join in on all the love and joy! Believing in Jesus helps us to be forgiven and enjoy a special friendship with God every day!"
\v 19 "Here's something really important: God sent Jesus to be like a bright light in the world. This light shows us what is good and right, which is God's love! But some people decide to stay in the dark, which means they want to keep doing bad things. They are scared that if they come into the light, everyone will see the mistakes they've made. Staying in the dark means they miss out on the love and joy that comes from believing in Jesus. God wants us to choose the light because it helps us make good choices and be close to Him forever!"
\v 20 "Some people are afraid to come to Jesus, who is the light. They worry that when they come close, others will see their wrong choices and think badly of them. But Jesus is here to help us! When we step into the light, we can be forgiven and learn to make better choices. He loves us so much and wants to show us how to live happily with God! Everyone should be brave and come to the light because that's where we find joy and love with God!"
\v 21 "People who trust in Jesus come to His light, just like stars shining brightly in the sky! They want everyone to see the good things they do because Jesus helps them. When we believe in Him, He fills our hearts with love, and the nice things we do show how amazing He is! Trusting in Jesus helps us shine and spread God's love, making the world a happier place for everyone!"
\v 22 After sharing God's wonderful love, Jesus and His friends went to a place called Judea. There, they spent time with many people, teaching them about God and baptizing those who wanted to show they believe in Jesus. Baptism is like saying, 'I’m sorry' for the wrong things we’ve done and making a promise to follow Jesus from now on. Everyone was excited to learn how to live with God's love in their hearts!
\v 23 "At that time, John the Baptist was in a place called Aenon, near Salim, where there was plenty of water. He was helping people get baptized because they were saying sorry for their wrong choices and wanting to follow Jesus. John was really important because he came to tell everyone about Jesus before He arrived. He wanted people to understand that when they believe in Jesus, they can be forgiven and have a special friendship with God forever!"
\v 24 "At that time, John the Baptist was not in prison; instead, he was sharing the wonderful news about Jesus! John helped people understand how important it is to say sorry for their wrong choices and to believe in Jesus to be close to God. He was like a friendly guide, showing everyone the way to happiness by trusting in Jesus, who loves us all!"
\v 25 "One day, some friends of John the Baptist were talking to a man about how to be clean in God's eyes. Being clean means saying sorry for the wrong things we do and wanting to do better, just like when we want to make things right with our friends. John the Baptist was very important because he taught people about Jesus, who helps us be clean and close to God. When we believe in Jesus and ask for forgiveness, we can feel God's love and grace in our hearts! It's like getting a fresh start to be part of God's big family!"
\v 26 Some of John the Baptist's friends came to him and said, "Teacher, remember the amazing man named Jesus you told us about? He is now helping many people show they believe in Him by getting baptized! This means they want to follow Jesus and be His friends forever. John, you helped everyone get ready to meet Jesus, and that's so important! Keep pointing us to Jesus, who is our Savior and loves everyone!"
\v 27 John said, "No one can receive God's special gifts, like love and forgiveness, unless they come from Heaven. Just like a flower needs water to grow and bloom, we need God's help to be our best selves! I’m here to help you see how great Jesus is because He brings us the most wonderful gifts from God. My job is to show you how to meet Jesus, who shares God's amazing love with everyone!"
\v 28 "You all remember when I told you, 'I'm not the special Savior, Jesus. I'm just a messenger from God, here to help you get ready to meet Him!' My job is to point everyone to Jesus, who is our Savior. I'm here to show you how amazing Jesus is, and I want you to know how much He loves us!"
\v 29 "Jesus is like a joyful bridegroom, who is super excited to be with all of us who believe in Him! I, John, am like the happy friend at the wedding, celebrating this special love. When I hear Jesus’ voice and see how much everyone loves Him, my heart fills with joy! It’s wonderful to help everyone learn about Jesus and how He cares for us. Being with Jesus is like being at a big family party full of love, and I’m so happy to share this news with you all!"
\v 30 "Jesus is like a bright shining light that fills our hearts! I, John, am happy to help others see how special He is. Jesus is the Lamb of God, our Savior, and it’s important for Him to be bigger in our lives. My joy comes from showing everyone how to love and follow Him, because He cares for all of us!"
\v 31 "Jesus is really special because He is God's Son, who came from Heaven. He knows everything about God and how to help us. While other people can teach us some things, Jesus shares important messages from God that show us how to live happily and lovingly. When we believe in Jesus, it’s like opening a door to God's love and being part of His family!"
\v 32 "Jesus shares amazing things that He has seen in Heaven, telling us how much God loves each of us! Believing in Jesus is super important because when you choose to trust Him, it helps you feel God's love in your heart. It's like opening a special door to God's family, where we can be really happy together! But if you decide not to believe, you might miss out on all the wonderful things that God wants to give you. Remember, believing in Jesus is the best way to stay close to God's love!"
\v 33 "When we believe what Jesus teaches, we are saying 'Yes!' to God's truth. It's super important to listen to Jesus because He tells us how much God loves us and how to be part of His family. Just like a wise friend who helps us see what is right, Jesus is our special guide showing us God's love. Accepting His message is like opening a treasure box filled with happiness and joy from God!"
\v 34 "God sent Jesus to be His special messenger, and He tells us the most important things about God's love! Jesus speaks with all the truth because He knows God perfectly, just like a really wise teacher helps us learn! God also gave Jesus the Holy Spirit to help us understand how to love each other better. When we believe in Jesus, we get to see how amazing God's love is and become part of His big family!"
\v 35 "God loves His Son, Jesus, just like a parent loves their child. Jesus is very special because He shows us how much God cares for everyone! If we believe in Jesus, we get to be part of God's amazing family, which means we will live happily with Him forever! It's like having the best friend ever who helps us be nice to others and always makes us feel loved. God wants us to be close to Him and enjoy all the wonderful things He has for us!"
\v 36 "When you believe in Jesus, you get to live forever with God, which is like being at the happiest party ever! But if you choose not to believe, you won’t get to join this wonderful life, and God really wants everyone to feel His love. Remember, choosing to trust Jesus is super important, so you can enjoy all the great things He has for you!"
