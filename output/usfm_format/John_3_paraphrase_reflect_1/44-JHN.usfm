\v 1 One night, a man named Nicodemus came to talk to Jesus. He was a leader from a group called the Pharisees, who were religious teachers and Jewish leaders.
\v 2 One night, a man named Nicodemus, who was a leader and teacher among the Jews, came to talk to Jesus. He said, 'Teacher, we know that you are special and have come from God because no one can do the wonderful things you do unless God is helping him.'
\v 3 Jesus answered, "Listen carefully! If someone doesn’t start fresh and become like a little baby again, they can't be part of God's special world."
\v 4 
\v 4-5 Nicodemus asked Jesus, "How can someone be born again when they are already old? Can they go back inside their mom to be born again?" Jesus said, "Listen, no one can be part of God’s special world unless they are born with water and the Spirit. This means that we need to have a new life from God inside us."
\v 6 People can only be born as babies from their moms. But when someone is born from God’s Spirit, they get a new life from God and become part of His family.
\v 7 Don’t be surprised that I said you need to be born again by God’s Spirit and start a new life with Him.
\v 8 The wind blows wherever it wants. You can hear it, but you don’t know where it comes from or where it goes. It’s just like the Spirit. When someone is born again by the Spirit, it’s a special change in their life that we can’t see, but we can feel it inside them.
\v 9 Nicodemus was confused and asked, "How can someone be born again like that? I don't understand!"
\v 10 Jesus replied, 'You teach the people of Israel, but you don't know these big ideas? That's surprising!'
\v 11 
\v 11-12 "I tell you the truth! We are talking about things we know and have seen about God, but you still don’t believe us. If I tell you about things that happen here on Earth and you don’t believe me, how will you believe when I talk about things in Heaven?"
\v 13 No one has ever gone to Heaven, except for Jesus, who came down from Heaven and is now in Heaven.
\v 14 Just like Moses raised a snake on a pole so the people could look at it and be healed, Jesus will be lifted up too, so everyone can be saved by believing in Him.
\v 15 So anyone who trusts in Jesus will not be lost but will live forever with God.
\v 16 God loved the world so much that He gave His one and only Son, so that everyone who believes in Him will not be lost, but will have eternal life.
\v 17 God didn’t send His Son to say who was bad. He sent Him to help everyone be safe and happy with God forever.
\v 18 If you believe in God’s Son, you are safe and happy. But if you don’t believe, you are choosing to stay away from God’s love and you won’t be safe with Him.
\v 19 This is how it is: God sent Jesus to bring goodness to the world, but some people chose to stay in their wrong actions instead of following Him. They liked doing bad things because they didn’t want to change, and that made them far from God.
\v 20 People who do bad things don't want to be seen, so they stay away from God's light because they don’t want anyone to know about their wrong choices.
\v 21 But whoever does what is true comes to the light so that everyone can see that the good things they do are because of God's help.
\v 22 After that, Jesus and His helpers went to Judea, where they talked to the people and showed them how to follow God. They helped by washing people with water to show they wanted to do good things with God's help.
\v 23 At the same time, John the Baptist was in a place called Aenon, close to Salim, where there was plenty of water. Many people came to John to be washed in the water because they wanted to follow God better.
\v 24 John wasn't in jail yet.
\v 25 Some of John’s followers started asking questions with a Jewish man about how to be pure in God’s eyes.
\v 26 Some of John’s followers came to him and said, "Teacher, do you remember that man who was with you on the other side of the river? You told us he was special. Now he is helping people get ready to follow God by splashing water on them, and everyone is going to him!"
\v 27 John answered, "No one can have anything unless God up above gives it to them. Everything we have comes from Him, like when someone shares a special gift."
\v 28 You all know I said, 'I am not the special one from God called the Christ.' I am just a person sent by God to share the good news about Him.
\v 29 The man who is getting married has his bride. The friend who stands close and listens to him feels so happy when he hears the man's voice. This happiness of mine is now full and complete.
\v 30 Jesus is like the bridegroom who makes the friend very happy. He needs to become more important, while I need to step aside and let Him shine.
\v 31 Jesus, who comes from heaven, is greater than everyone on earth. People here only talk about things that are from this world, but Jesus talks about things from above because He is from there.
\v 32 Jesus has seen and heard amazing things from God, and he shares them with everyone, but not everyone believes what he tells them.
\v 33 If you believe what Jesus says, it shows that God tells the truth.
\v 34 God sent Jesus, and Jesus tells us what God says. God gives His Spirit to Jesus fully, so He can share God's love and truth with everyone.
\v 35 The Father loves the Son a lot and has given him the job of taking care of everything because of their special bond.
\v 36 Anyone who believes in Jesus has everlasting life. But those who don’t believe in him won’t experience this wonderful life; instead, it makes God sad because he loves everyone so much.
