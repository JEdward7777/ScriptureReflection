\v 1 Now there was a man among the Pharisees, named Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews.
\v 2 This man came to Him at night and said, 'Rabbi, we know that You have come from God as a teacher; for no one can perform these signs that You do unless God is with him.'
\v 3 Jesus answered him, 'Truly, truly, I say to you, unless one is born from above, he cannot see the kingdom of God.'
\v 4 Nicodemus said to Him, 'How can a man be born when he is old? Can he enter a second time into his mother’s womb and be born?'
\v 5 Jesus answered, "Truly, truly, I say to you, unless one is born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter the kingdom of God."
\v 6 That which is born of the flesh is flesh, and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit.
\v 7 Do not be amazed that I said to you, 'You must be born from above.'
\v 8 The wind blows where it wishes, and you hear its sound, but you do not know where it comes from or where it goes. So it is with everyone who is born of the Spirit.
\v 9 Nicodemus answered and said to Him, "How can these things be?"
\v 10 Jesus answered and said to him, "You are the teacher of Israel, and you do not understand these things?"
\v 11 Truly, truly, I say to you, we speak of what we know and testify to what we have seen, yet you do not accept our testimony.
\v 12 If I have spoken to you about earthly things and you do not believe, how will you believe if I speak to you about heavenly things?
\v 13 And no one has ascended into heaven except the one who descended from heaven, the Son of Man, who is in heaven.
\v 14 And just as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, so must the Son of Man be lifted up.
\v 15 that everyone who believes in him may not perish, but have everlasting life.
\v 16 For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that everyone who believes in Him may not perish but have everlasting life.
\v 17 For God did not send His Son into the world to condemn the world, but that the world might be saved through Him.
\v 18 The one who believes in Him is not condemned; but the one who does not believe is already condemned, because he has not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God.
\v 19 And this is the judgment: the light has come into the world, and men loved the darkness rather than the light, because their deeds were evil.
\v 20 For everyone who practices evil hates the light and does not come to the light, lest their deeds be exposed.
\v 21 But whoever lives by the truth comes into the light, so that it may be seen plainly that what they have done has been done in the sight of God.
\v 22 After this, Jesus and his disciples went into the Judean countryside, where he spent time with them and baptized.
\v 23 John was also baptizing at Aenon near Salim, because there was plenty of water there; and people were coming and being baptized.
\v 24 For John had not yet been thrown into prison.
\v 25 Then a dispute arose between some of John’s disciples and a Jew about purification.
\v 26 And they came to John and said to him, 'Rabbi, the one who was with you across the Jordan, whom you have testified about, look, he is baptizing, and everyone is going to him.'
\v 27 John answered, saying, 'A person cannot receive even one thing unless it has been given him from heaven.'
\v 28 You yourselves bear witness that I said, 'I am not the Christ, but I have been sent before him.'
\v 29 The one who has the bride is the bridegroom; the friend who stands and listens to him rejoices greatly at the bridegroom's voice. Therefore, my joy is now complete.
\v 30 He must become greater; I must become less.
\v 31 He who comes from above is above all; he who is of the earth belongs to the earth and speaks from an earthly perspective. He who comes from heaven is above all.
\v 32 And he has seen and heard; he testifies to what he knows, yet no one accepts his testimony.
\v 33 Whoever receives his testimony certifies that God is true.
\v 34 For he whom God has sent speaks the words of God, for he gives the Spirit without measure.
\v 35 The Father loves the Son and has entrusted everything into His hands.
\v 36 The one who believes in the Son has eternal life; but the one who disobeys the Son will not see life, for the wrath of God remains upon him.
