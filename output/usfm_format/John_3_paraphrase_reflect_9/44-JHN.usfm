\v 1 One night, a curious man named Nicodemus came to see Jesus. He was a teacher of God's laws and a leader among the Jewish people. Nicodemus believed that Jesus came from God and wanted to ask Him important questions about how to believe in God and understand Him better.
\v 2 One night, a man named Nicodemus, who was a teacher and leader of the Jewish people, came to see Jesus. He was curious and wanted to learn more about Him. He said, 'Rabbi, we know you are someone sent by God because you do incredible miracles. No one could do those things unless God is helping him.' A Rabbi is a teacher who shows people how to know God better.
\v 3 Jesus answered him, 'You need to be born from above to see God's kingdom. This means you need a special new beginning with God, like starting fresh. It's about getting to know Him and being close to Him forever in heaven.'
\v 4 
\v 4-5 Nicodemus was still confused and said to Jesus, "How can an old person be born again? Can they go back into their mom's tummy to be born again?" Jesus replied, "Listen closely! No one can see God's Kingdom unless they are born again. This means they need to start a new life with God. First, they believe in me, and that helps them know God better. When they believe, God's Spirit changes them inside. Baptism shows that they want to follow me and shows everyone their new life. This is how we start fresh with God, and it means we can be with Him forever!"
\v 6 When a baby is born, they come from their mom, which is a regular birth. But when someone believes in Jesus, they get a special new start from God’s Spirit. This means they change inside to follow Jesus better. When we get baptized, it shows everyone that we believe in Jesus and want to listen to Him. This new life helps us love like God loves us and be part of His family, learning to share that love with others!
\v 7 It's important for you to know that everyone must be born again to truly be part of God's family. When we believe in Jesus, it’s like getting a brand new start from God’s Spirit. This special new birth helps us change inside, allowing us to learn about God's love and live happily together with Him!
\v 8 The Holy Spirit is like the wind; you can’t see it, but you can feel it. Just like how you feel a nice breeze on your face, you can feel the Holy Spirit helping you when you believe in Jesus. He gives you a new heart that wants to love God and others. Even if you can’t see Him, you can feel the wonderful changes inside you. The Holy Spirit is God's special gift to you, guiding and comforting you as you grow in faith!
\v 9 Nicodemus, who was a teacher, was puzzled by what Jesus said. He asked, "How can someone be born again? What does that mean?" He didn’t understand how believing in Jesus could make someone feel different on the inside. Just like the wind that you can feel but not see, the Holy Spirit works inside us when we trust in Jesus. This belief is what makes us new and helps us love God and others more every day.
\v 10 Jesus replied, 'You are a teacher of God's people, but you don't understand what it means to be born again. It's really important to know how trusting in Jesus makes our hearts new and helps us love better every day!'
\v 11 
\v 11-12 "I have something super important to tell you! We share what we know about God, but not everyone believes what we say. If I talk about everyday things and you don’t believe me, how can I expect you to trust me when I share about God who lives in Heaven? Believing in Jesus shows us how much God loves us and helps us see His amazing truths!"
\v 13 "No one can go up to Heaven except Jesus. He is very special because He came down from Heaven to help us. We call Him the Son of Man, which means He understands everything about Heaven. When He talks to us, He tells us the truth about God. If we believe in Jesus, we learn how much God loves us, and we understand that He is the only way to God and Heaven."
\v 14 Just like Moses held up a snake on a stick in the desert to help people feel better when they were sick, Jesus will be lifted up on a cross. When we look at Jesus and believe in Him, He can save us and let us be with God forever. Just like the people needed to look at the snake to get better, we need to trust Jesus to help us. Trusting Jesus means believing that He died for the wrong things we do, so we can be forgiven. When we look to Him, He fills our hearts with hope and shows us how much God loves us!
\v 15 Everyone who believes in Jesus, God's special Son, will not be lost but will have life forever with God. Just like the people looked at the snake to be healed, we need to trust in Jesus to be saved. He loves us very much, and when we trust Him, we can live with God forever! Trusting Jesus means we believe He died for our wrong choices, and that makes our hearts full of hope.
\v 16 God loves everyone so much that He gave us His one and only Son, Jesus. If you believe in Him, He will forgive you for your mistakes and help you be with God forever. When you trust in Jesus, you get to live with God forever, and that makes your heart feel full of joy.
\v 17 God didn't send Jesus to point out all the things we do wrong. He sent Jesus because He loves us so much! When we believe in Jesus, He saves us from our mistakes and helps us to be close to God. Trusting in Jesus means we get to have a happy life with God forever.
\v 18 If you believe in Jesus, God's Son, you are safe and can be close to Him forever because He loves you! But if you don't believe in Him, you are choosing to stay away from God, and that means you won't get to feel His love and joy. That's really sad because God wants to be your friend!
\v 19 Here’s something really important: God sent Jesus to be the bright light that shows us the good things to do. But some people choose to ignore Jesus and stay in the dark. They like to do bad things instead of the right ones, and that makes them miss out on God's love and happiness. Choosing darkness means they won't get to be close to God, and that’s really sad because God wants to be their friend! We all have to decide if we want to follow Jesus, who is the light, so we can feel God's love and joy in our hearts.
\v 20 Some people choose to do bad things, which we call sin, and they stay away from God's light because they are afraid their wrong choices will be seen. But God's light is here to show us how much He loves us and helps us make better choices. When we hide from the light, we miss out on His happiness and love. God really wants us to come to Him, say we're sorry for the wrong things we've done, and let Him help us do what is right. He loves us so much and is always ready to forgive us when we turn back to Him.
\v 21 When people are honest and choose to do what is right, they come closer to God's light. This shows everyone that the good things they do are helped by God because they trust Him and want to make Him happy. God's light helps us be our best and lets others see His love in us.
\v 22 After that, Jesus and His friends went to Judea. There, Jesus taught everyone how to love God and each other. He baptized people to help them show they are sorry for their mistakes and that they wanted to follow Him. This baptism was important because it showed everyone they believed in Jesus and wanted to do what God wants. Jesus asked us to be baptized to show our trust in Him and to obey His teaching.
\v 23 At the same time, John the Baptist was in a place called Aenon, near Salim, where there was lots of water. Many people came to John to be baptized because they wanted to show they were sorry for the wrong things they did. This was their way of saying they wanted to be friends with God and follow Jesus. Being baptized was special because it showed they believed in Jesus and wanted to live the way God wants. John helped them promise to be part of God’s family and to be ready for what Jesus was teaching everyone.
\v 24 At that time, John the Baptist was in a place called Aenon, near Salim, where there was a lot of water. He was still teaching people about God and helping them get ready to follow Jesus because many came to him, feeling sorry for the wrong things they did. They wanted to show God they loved Him and start fresh. When they were baptized in the water, it was a special way to say they wanted to be close to God again. John helped them understand how to follow God's way and be part of His family. John hadn’t been put in prison yet.
\v 25 One day, John the Baptist's friends, called disciples, were talking to a Jewish teacher. They were asking questions about how people can be made clean and what it means to please God. They learned that baptism is a way to show that we are sorry for our mistakes and want to follow Jesus. John the Baptist taught everyone that baptism is not only a sign of love but also a way to obey God and tell others we believe in Him.
\v 26 Some of John's friends came to him and said, "Teacher, remember that man you talked about, Jesus? He is baptizing people, and everyone is going to Him! They want to learn from Him and follow God, just like you taught them. Why do you think so many people are going to Him?"
\v 27 John answered, "No one can have anything good unless it is given to them from heaven. It’s like when you have a birthday party: you can’t get presents unless someone decides to give them to you. God gives us the best gifts, and those gifts help us learn about Him and love Him even more!"
\v 28 John the Baptist said, 'Remember, I told you that I am not the special one you are looking for. I am here to help everyone get ready for Jesus. God sent me to tell you the good news and help you understand how wonderful Jesus is, because He is our Savior, the one who can save us all!"
\v 29 John said, 'Jesus is like a groom who really loves his bride, and I am his friend helping him get everything ready. When I hear the groom's voice, it makes me super happy! My joy is full because I get to tell everyone how special Jesus is. He is the true Savior we have all been waiting for!"
\v 30 Jesus should be the most important person, and I want everyone to see Him more and more! When Jesus shines brighter, it makes me really happy! I step back so that He can be in the spotlight, and that's a wonderful feeling! I want everyone to know how amazing Jesus is, and I can't wait to share the good news about Him.
\v 31 Jesus is the best of all because He came from heaven! People on earth can only talk about what they see, but Jesus knows everything about God because He comes from above. It’s like He has super vision that lets Him see everything clearly! He teaches us important things about God’s love, and that’s why we should listen to Him and believe in Him.
\v 32 Jesus shares with us everything He has seen and heard from God. His words are like treasures that tell us the truth. It’s super important to believe in Him because He knows exactly what God wants us to understand. But some people don’t pay attention to what He says and don’t believe in Him. This can keep them from feeling God's love and knowing the truth He shares.
\v 33 When we believe what Jesus tells us, it's like saying we really trust God because He always speaks the truth. Jesus is God's Son, and He shares special messages that help us know God better. When we believe in Jesus, we not only learn about God's truth, but we also feel God's love and joy in our hearts!
\v 34 God sent Jesus to share all about His love and amazing plan. Jesus speaks God's words with authority because the Holy Spirit is always with Him. This means that we can believe everything Jesus tells us, as He shows us the truth about God and how much He loves us.
\v 35 God loves Jesus, His only Son, a whole lot! He has given Jesus the power to help us because Jesus is very special. Jesus tells us all about God and shows us how to live because He is really close to God. We can trust Him completely because He knows what God wants for us.
\v 36 If you believe in Jesus, you will have life forever with God, and that’s amazing! But if you don’t believe in Him, you won’t see that happy life with God, and instead, you will face God’s anger because He wants us to trust Him. God loves everyone and really wants us to be happy together, just like Jesus teaches us how to live.
