\v 1 One night, a man named Nicodemus came to see Jesus. He was a Pharisee, which means he was a teacher of God's laws and a leader of the Jewish people. Nicodemus wanted to learn more about God and believed that Jesus came from God, so he had important questions to ask Him.
\v 2 Nicodemus quietly came to Jesus one night and said, 'Rabbi, we know you are someone sent by God because you do amazing things. No one could do those things unless God is helping him.' A Rabbi is a teacher who helps people know God better.
\v 3 Jesus answered him, 'You must be born again to see God's kingdom. This means you need to start fresh in your heart with God and change your life to be with Him forever in heaven.'
\v 4 
\v 4-5 Nicodemus was confused and asked, 'How can an old person be born again? Can they go back inside their mom's tummy to be born again?' Jesus replied, 'Listen carefully! No one can see God's Kingdom unless they are born again, which means they need to start a new life with God. When someone believes in me, God's Spirit helps them change inside. Being baptized shows everyone that they believe in me and want to follow my way. It's important because it shows obedience to God and a fresh start with Him!'
\v 6 When a baby is born, they come from their mom. But when someone believes in Jesus, it’s like getting a special new start from God’s Spirit, which means they change on the inside to become more like Jesus!
\v 7 Everyone needs to be born again to be a part of God's family. Believing in Jesus means starting fresh with God's Spirit, feeling love in our hearts, and learning to share that love with others.
\v 8 The Holy Spirit is like the wind; you can’t see it, but you can feel it. When you believe in Jesus, you feel the Holy Spirit working in your heart, helping you love God and others.
\v 9 Nicodemus was curious and asked, 'How can someone be born again? What does that mean?' He couldn’t see how trusting in Jesus could change someone’s heart. But believing in Jesus brings new life inside.
\v 10 Jesus answered, 'You are a teacher of God’s people, but you don’t understand what it means to be born again. Trusting in Jesus changes our hearts and helps us understand God's love better.'
\v 11 
\v 11-12 'I want to share something important! We talk about what we know about God, but some people still don’t believe us. If you don’t believe the everyday things I tell you, how can you trust me about God in Heaven? Believing in Jesus helps us see how much God loves us!'
\v 13 No one can go up to Heaven except for Jesus, who came down from there. He is the Son of Man and knows all about Heaven. He tells us the truth about God.
\v 14 Just like Moses held up a snake on a stick in the desert to help people feel better when they were sick, Jesus will be lifted up on a cross to help us with our sins. We need to trust Him to save us.
\v 15 Everyone who believes in Jesus will have life forever with God. Jesus loves us, and when we believe in Him, we can be with God forever!
\v 16 God loves everyone so much that He gave us His one and only Son, Jesus. If you believe in Him, you will be forgiven and able to be with God forever!
\v 17 God didn’t send Jesus to tell us we’re wrong. He sent Him because He loves everyone! Jesus came to save us, not to judge us.
\v 18 If you believe in Jesus, you can be close to Him forever! But if you don’t believe in Him, you are missing out on the happiness that comes from God.
\v 19 Here’s something important: God sent Jesus to be the light that shows us the good things to do. Some people choose to stay away from Jesus and miss out on His love.
\v 20 Some people do wrong things and stay away from Jesus because they don’t want their mistakes seen. But Jesus shows us how much God loves us and helps us choose what is right.
\v 21 When people choose to do what is right, they get closer to God, and their good actions show that they trust Him.
\v 22 After that, Jesus and His friends went to Judea, where Jesus taught everyone how to love God and baptized people who wanted to follow Him.
\v 23 At the same time, John the Baptist was in Aenon, near Salim, where there was a lot of water. Many people came to him to be baptized, showing they wanted to say sorry for their sins.
\v 24 John was teaching people about God and helping them prepare to follow Jesus.
\v 25 One day, John's friends talked to a Jewish teacher about how to be clean inside and make God happy.
\v 26 Some of John's friends told him, 'Remember Jesus? He's baptizing people now, and everyone is going to Him! What do you think about this?'
\v 27 John replied, 'No one can have anything good unless God gives it to them. Everything good comes from God!'
\v 28 John the Baptist said, 'Don't forget, I told you I’m not the important one. I’m here to help others get ready for Jesus, who can save everyone!'
\v 29 John said, 'Jesus is the groom who loves his bride, and I am like his friend who is happy for him! My heart is full of joy because I get to tell everyone how special Jesus is!'
\v 30 Jesus should be number one in everyone's hearts! I want everyone to notice Him more and more.
\v 31 Jesus is the greatest because He came from heaven! He shows us God's love with His actions.
\v 32 Jesus tells us everything He has seen and heard from God. We need to believe Him because His words show us the truth.
\v 33 When someone believes what Jesus says, they show that they trust God and understand His love.
\v 34 God sent Jesus to tell us about His love. Jesus speaks the truth, and we can trust what He says.
\v 35 God loves Jesus very much! He has given Jesus the power to guide us and show us how to live well.
\v 36 If you believe in Jesus, you get to live forever with God! But if you don’t believe in Him, you miss out on that joy.
