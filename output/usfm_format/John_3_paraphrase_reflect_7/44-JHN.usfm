\v 1 One night, a wise teacher named Nicodemus came to visit Jesus. Nicodemus was a leader of the Jews and a Pharisee, which means he really loved and followed God's laws. He was curious about Jesus and wanted to learn more about His teachings and how to have faith in God.
\v 2 One night, Nicodemus, a Jewish teacher and a Pharisee who really tried to follow God’s laws, came to talk to Jesus. He said, 'Rabbi, we know you are from God because no one can do the amazing things you do unless God is with him.' A Rabbi is a teacher who helps people learn about God.
\v 3 Jesus said, 'Listen carefully! You need to start a new life with God to see His kingdom and be with Him forever in heaven.'
\v 4 
\v 4-5 Nicodemus asked Jesus, "How can someone be born again when they are already old? Can they go back into their mom's tummy to be born?" Jesus replied, "Listen carefully! No one can see God's Kingdom unless they start a new life with God. To start this new life, people must be baptized, which is like a special washing, and they also need to be born from God's Spirit. When we believe in Jesus, God's Spirit helps us change inside and trust Him to save us. This means we are starting fresh with God and can be close to Him forever!"
\v 6 When a baby is born, they come from their mom, which is a physical birth. But when someone believes in Jesus, they experience a special spiritual birth through God's Spirit. This is like getting a new heart that helps them believe in Jesus and make good choices. When we get baptized, it shows everyone that we trust Jesus and want to live for Him. This new life means we can love others better and be part of God's family, learning about His love together!
\v 7 I want you to know that everyone must believe in Jesus to start fresh with God, like having a special new birth. This means God gives you a new heart that helps you care for others and enjoy life with Him. By believing in Jesus, you become part of His big family where you can learn about His love together!
\v 8 Just like the wind blows wherever it wants, and we can hear it but can’t see it, the Holy Spirit works in our lives in a similar way. When you believe in Jesus, it's like getting a brand new heart. The Holy Spirit is a special helper that makes this change happen inside you, even if you can’t see it. You’ll start to feel more love for God and for other people, which is a wonderful gift from God that comes when you choose to believe in Jesus and become part of His family.
\v 9 Nicodemus was a teacher who didn’t understand what Jesus meant. He said, "How can someone be born again? What does it mean to believe in Jesus?" He was trying to learn how believing in Jesus can make someone new on the inside, like how the wind changes things even when we can't see it happen.
\v 10 Jesus replied, 'You are a teacher for the people of Israel, and it's very important to understand how God works. I want to share this with you so you can learn more about Him!'
\v 11 
\v 11-12 "I want you to know something really important! We talk about what we know and what we’ve seen about God, but you don’t believe us. If I tell you about things we can see and you don’t trust me, how can you believe me when I share about God in Heaven? Trusting in Jesus helps you see God’s love and understand all the amazing things He does!"
\v 13 No one has gone up to Heaven, except for Jesus, who came down from Heaven. He is called the Son of Man, which shows He is both special and important. Because He came from Heaven, He knows everything about it. When He talks to us, He tells us the truth. If we believe in Him, we can understand God better and know how much He loves us!
\v 14 Just like Moses lifted a snake up high on a pole in the desert to help the people who were sick, Jesus will also be lifted up. When we look at Jesus and believe in Him, we can be saved and live with God forever. Just like the people had to look at the snake to get better, we need to trust Jesus to help us because He loves us so much. We all make mistakes, but when we look to Him, He forgives us and gives us hope!
\v 15 Everyone who believes in Jesus, God's special Son, will not be lost but will have a wonderful life that never ends with God. Just like the people looked at the snake on the pole to be healed, we need to look to Jesus and trust Him to save us. He loves us very much and was lifted up so that we can have forever life with God when we believe in Him!
\v 16 God loves everyone so much that He gave us His one and only Son, Jesus. If you believe in Him, He will forgive your sins and help you be close to God. When you trust in Jesus, you will live forever and be very happy with God!
\v 17 God didn’t send His Son, Jesus, to tell us when we are wrong. He sent Jesus because He loves us very much! If we believe in Jesus, He forgives us for the wrong things we do, which helps us to be better friends with God. This way, we can be close to Him and have a happy life with Him forever.
\v 18 If you believe in Jesus, God's Son, you are safe and can be close to Him forever because He loves you! But if you don’t believe in Him, you can’t feel His love, and that means you miss out on being His friend.
\v 19 Now listen closely: God sent Jesus to be the bright light that helps us see how to do good things. But some people don’t want to follow Jesus, so they stay in the dark. They love doing wrong things instead of what is right, and that keeps them away from God’s love and joy. This is a really important choice we all have to make because God loves us and wants us to be close to Him. Following Jesus, the light, is how we truly experience His love.
\v 20 Some people decide to do bad things, and they want to stay away from God's light because they are scared of being told they've done something wrong. But God’s light shows us how much He loves us and helps us make good choices. When we stay in the dark, we miss out on God's happiness and love. God really wants us to come into His light, say we're sorry for the wrong things we've done, and let Him help us do what is right. He loves us so much and is always ready to forgive us when we come back to Him.
\v 21 But when people are honest and do what is true, they come into God's light. This shows everyone that their good deeds are done with God's help because they want to follow Him and make Him happy.
\v 22 After that, Jesus and His friends went to Judea. There, Jesus taught people about loving God and each other. He baptized people to help them say sorry for bad things and to show they wanted to follow Him. This baptism was a way to show they believed in Jesus and wanted to live how God wants us to live.
\v 23 At the same time, John the Baptist was in a place called Aenon, near Salim, where there was a lot of water. Many people came to John because they wanted to say they were sorry for the wrong things they did. They wanted to be friends with God again and get ready to follow Jesus. Baptism was a special way to show that they believed in Jesus and loved God. John was helping them make a promise to be part of God's family and to live the way God wants them to, just like Jesus was teaching everyone to do.
\v 24 At that time, John the Baptist was still free and teaching people about God. Many came to him to be baptized because they wanted to say sorry for their wrong choices and start fresh with God. Baptism was a special sign that showed they loved God and wanted to follow Jesus. John was a messenger from God, helping everyone know how to follow Him.
\v 25 Some of John the Baptist's friends, called disciples, were talking with a Jewish man. They wanted to learn how to be right with God and make Him happy. They were curious about baptism, which is a way people show God they are truly sorry for their wrong choices and want to start fresh with Him. John the Baptist helped everyone understand that baptism is a special sign of love and an important step in following Jesus.
\v 26 Some of John's friends came to him and said, "Teacher, do you remember the special man you talked about, Jesus? He's the Son of God! Now He is baptizing people, and many are going to Him. Baptism shows that people want to love God and start fresh, just like you taught them! It's so wonderful to see so many people wanting to follow Him!"
\v 27 John answered, "Nobody can have good things unless God lets them have it. Think of it like this: just like how you need someone to give you a present on your birthday, we need God to give us His good gifts. All the wonderful things like love, joy, peace, and wisdom come from God's heart, and they help us to know Him better!"
\v 28 John the Baptist said, 'Remember how I told you that I am not the Christ, the one everyone is waiting for? I am like a helper who gets people ready to meet Him. God sent me to tell everyone to stop doing bad things and to get their hearts ready for Jesus, who is the true Savior.'
\v 29 John said, 'Jesus is like a groom who loves his bride. I am a helper for the groom. When I hear the groom's voice, I feel really happy! My happiness is complete because I get to tell everyone about Jesus. He is the Savior that everyone has been waiting for.'
\v 30 Jesus must be the most important person, and He needs to grow bigger and bigger! I feel really happy when I help everyone see how wonderful He is. It's like when I step back so Jesus can shine brighter; that brings me so much joy! I want everyone to see how amazing He is, and I'm excited to share the good news about Him as He becomes even more glorious.
\v 31 Jesus is the one who came from heaven, and He is greater than anyone else! People here on earth can only talk about what they know, like sharing stories about their own lives, and sometimes they miss the big picture. But Jesus knows everything about God because He comes from heaven, where He sees everything clearly, like a superhero who can see far and wide! That’s why Jesus is better than everyone else! He has special knowledge and power that makes Him truly amazing.
\v 32 Jesus shares with us what He has seen and heard from God. His words are the truth and really special, so it's super important to believe in Him. But not everyone listens to Him, and some people decide not to believe what He says, even though He tells us what God wants us to know.
\v 33 When we believe what Jesus says, it shows that we trust God because He is always true. Jesus is God’s Son, and He speaks with authority about what God wants us to know. By believing in Jesus, we open our hearts to God's truth and build a close friendship with Him!
\v 34 God sent Jesus to share God’s words with us. Jesus tells us what God wants because the Holy Spirit is with Him. This shows that Jesus has God's special authority, and we can trust Him completely to share what God says.
\v 35 God loves Jesus, His Son, very much. He has given Jesus all power to help us. Jesus knows what God wants us to do because He shares God's message with us. Just like a great leader, He cares for us and guides us in the right way. We can trust Jesus completely to show us how to live because He is so close to God.
\v 36 If you believe in Jesus, you will have life forever with God. But if you don't believe in Him, you won't have that life. God loves everyone and wants them to choose to trust Him and be happy with Him, just like Jesus shows us how to live.
