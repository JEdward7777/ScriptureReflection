\v 1 There was a man named Nicodemus. He was a Pharisee and a leader of the Jews.
\v 2 This man came to Jesus at night and said to Him, 'Rabbi, we know that You are a teacher who has come from God, for no one can do the signs that You do unless God is with him.'
\v 3 Jesus answered and said to him, "Truly, truly, I say to you, unless someone is born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God."
\v 4 Nicodemus said to Him, "How can a person be born when he is old? Can he enter a second time into his mother’s womb and be born again?"
\v 4-5 Nicodemus asked Him, 'How can someone be born when they are old? Can they go back into their mother's belly and be born again?' Jesus answered, 'I tell you the truth, unless someone is born from water and the Spirit, they cannot enter the kingdom of God.'
\v 6 What is born from the flesh is flesh, and what is born from the Spirit is spirit.
\v 7 Do not be surprised that I told you, ‘You must be born from above.’
\v 8 The wind blows wherever it pleases. You hear its sound, but you cannot tell where it comes from or where it is going. So it is with everyone born of the Spirit.
\v 9 Nicodemus answered and said to Him, "How can these things happen?"
\v 10 Jesus answered him, "You are the teacher of Israel, and yet you do not understand these things?"
\v 11 Truly, truly, I say to you, we speak of what we know, and we testify to what we have seen, yet you do not accept our testimony.
\v 12 If I have told you about earthly things and you do not believe, how can you believe if I tell you about heavenly things?
\v 13 No one has gone up to heaven except the one who came down from heaven—the Son of Man, who is in heaven.
\v 14 And just as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, so must the Son of Man be lifted up.
\v 15 so that everyone who believes in Him will not be lost but will have eternal life.
\v 16 For God loved the world so much that He gave His one and only Son, so that everyone who believes in Him will not be lost but will have eternal life.
\v 17 For God did not send His Son into the world to judge the world, but to save the world through Him.
\v 18 Anyone who believes in Him is not judged. But anyone who does not believe is already judged, because they have not believed in the name of God's one and only Son.
\v 19 This is the judgment: Light has come into the world, but people loved the darkness rather than the light because their deeds were evil.
\v 20 For everyone who does wrong hates the light and will not come to the light, because they do not want their actions to be shown.
\v 21 But whoever lives by the truth comes into the light, so that it may be seen plainly that what they have done has been done in the sight of God.
\v 22 After this, Jesus and his disciples went into the Judean countryside, where they spent some time with them and baptized.
\v 23 John was also baptizing in Aenon near Salim, because there was plenty of water there, and people were coming and being baptized.
\v 24 For John had not yet been put in prison.
\v 25 Then there arose a debate among John’s disciples with a Jew about purification.
\v 26 And they came to John and said to him, 'Rabbi, the man who was with you across the Jordan, the one you testified about, look, he is baptizing, and everyone is going to him.'
\v 27 John replied, "No one can receive anything unless it is given to him from heaven."
\v 28 You all are my witnesses that I said, 'I am not the Christ, but I am a messenger sent before Him.'
\v 29 He who has the bride is the bridegroom. The friend who attends the bridegroom stands and listens for him, and is full of joy when he hears the bridegroom's voice. That joy is mine, and it is now complete.
\v 30 He must become greater; I must become less.
\v 30-31 He must become greater; I must become less. The one who comes from above is above all. The one who is from the earth belongs to the earth and speaks about earthly things; the one who comes from heaven is above all.
\v 32 He tells us what he has seen and heard, but nobody believes him.
\v 33 The person who accepts what He says has confirmed that God is indeed truthful.
\v 34 For the one whom God has sent speaks the words of God; for God gives the Spirit without measure.
\v 35 The Father loves the Son and has given everything into His hands.
\v 36 Whoever believes in the Son has eternal life; but whoever does not obey the Son will not see life, but the wrath of God remains on them.
