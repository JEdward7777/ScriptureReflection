\v 1 One night, a man named Nicodemus came to see Jesus. He was a Pharisee, which means he was a special teacher of God's people. Nicodemus wanted to learn more about Jesus because he was curious about what Jesus was teaching and the amazing things he was doing.
\v 2 One night, a man named Nicodemus, who was a teacher of God's people, came to see Jesus. He said, 'Rabbi, we know you are a special teacher from God because you do amazing miracles that only God can help you do!' Nicodemus was eager to learn more about Jesus and the wonderful things He was doing.
\v 3 Jesus said, "Listen closely! To really be part of God’s family, you have to start fresh, like a baby being born! It’s super important! God’s Spirit will help you grow and change inside. When you do this, you will feel His love in your heart and know you’re starting new with God!"
\v 4 Nicodemus asked Jesus, "How can a person be born again when they are already old? Can they go back into their mother's belly and be born a second time?"
\v 4-5 Nicodemus asked Jesus, "How can a grown-up start all over again? Can someone go back into their mommy's tummy to be born again?" Jesus replied, "Listen carefully! No one can be part of God's kingdom unless they are born from water and the Spirit. This means that when you trust in God’s Spirit, it’s like getting a fresh start with Him! It helps you feel His love and be part of His family forever!"
\v 6 "When a baby is born, it comes from its mommy. But when someone lets God's Spirit come into their heart, it's like getting a special new start with God! This means they can feel His love and grow to be more like Jesus every day!"
\v 7 "Listen! It’s super important to know that you need to start fresh with God! He wants to fill your heart with His love so you can be part of His family forever! This new life helps you feel close to Him every day!"
\v 8 "The Spirit is like the wind. You can feel it blowing all around you, but you can't see where it comes from or where it goes. This is just like when God's Spirit comes into your heart. It helps you start a new life with God, filling your heart with His love and helping you become His friend forever! So, when you let the Spirit in, it’s a special gift that changes your life and makes you part of God's family!"
\v 9 Nicodemus said to Jesus, "I’m confused! How can someone really start over and be born again with God? I want to understand how believing in you can give us this new life! It feels so important!"
\v 10 Jesus said, "Nicodemus, you teach people about God! You should understand how important it is to be born again. When you start fresh with God, you feel His love in your heart, and you can share that love with everyone! It’s a special gift that helps us all get closer to God!"
\v 11 I tell you the truth, we are sharing what we know and what we have seen, but you don’t believe our message.
\v 11-12 "I want to share something very important! We talk about what we have seen and learned about God, but many people don’t believe us. If you can't trust what I say about things here on Earth, how will you believe what I tell you about the amazing things in Heaven? Believing in Jesus helps you understand God’s love and the special truth of His kingdom!"
\v 13 "Only Jesus has come down from Heaven. He is God’s one and only Son! When you believe in Jesus, you can see how much God loves you, and you can be friends with Him forever! This is so special because it means you can be part of God’s happy family!"
\v 14 "Just like Moses lifted up a snake in the desert to help the sick people, Jesus must be lifted up too! When we look to Jesus and believe in Him, it helps us feel better and be saved. Believing in Jesus is how we get God's love and become part of His happy family forever!"
\v 15 "Everyone who trusts in Jesus will be saved! When you believe in Him, you can feel God's love in your heart and be His friend forever. This means you get to be part of God's happy family and enjoy a special life with Him that lasts forever!"
\v 16 "God loves everyone in the world so much that He gave us His one and only Son, Jesus, to save us. If you believe in Him, you will be with God forever! This means you can always feel God's love in your heart and be His special friend! Jesus was given to us because God wants us to feel safe and happy in His family forever, where His love never ends!"
\v 17 "God loves everyone so much that He sent Jesus to help us, not to judge us. Jesus came to show us how to be friends with God and feel His love in our hearts every day! When we believe in Jesus, we get to be part of God's happy family forever!"
\v 18 "If you believe in Jesus, God will not judge you. You will feel His love, just like a true friend! But if you don’t believe in Him, it’s like walking away from God, who wants to be close to you. God loves everyone and hopes that we all believe in His Son so we can enjoy His love forever!"
\v 19 "Here’s something really important: God sent Jesus to be a bright light for everyone in the world. But some people decide to stay in the dark because they want to keep making bad choices that make God sad. They don't see how wonderful the light of Jesus can be! Choosing to follow Jesus means saying yes to His love and living in His light, which helps us feel happy and close to God every day! If we stay in the dark, we miss out on all the good things God has for us!"
\v 20 "Sometimes, people might be scared to come to Jesus because they feel bad about the wrong things they have done. They want to hide their mistakes. But Jesus is like a warm, bright light that helps us feel safe and shows us how to make good choices! When we trust Him, we don’t have to be afraid anymore, and we can feel His love. Remember, Jesus is here for everyone, no matter what mistakes they’ve made, and He wants us to come to Him so we can be part of His happy family!"
\v 21 "When someone does good things and follows Jesus, it shows that God is helping them! This means God's love is working in their heart. Trusting in Jesus helps us to shine bright and share God's love with everyone!"
\v 22 "After that, Jesus and His friends, called disciples, went to a place called Judea. There, they spent time with the people and Jesus baptized many of them. Baptism is a special way to show that we want to love and follow Jesus. It’s like saying, 'I want to be part of Your family, Jesus!' Getting baptized is a joyful way to share in His love forever!"
\v 23 "At that time, John the Baptist was in a place with lots of water, and he was happily baptizing many people. Baptism is a special way to show everyone that we love God and want to follow Jesus! John was really excited every time someone got baptized because it was a wonderful sign that they were saying 'Yes!' to God’s love and getting closer to being part of His happy family! He wanted to help everyone know how special Jesus is!"
\v 24 "Right now, John the Baptist is really busy telling everyone about Jesus! He wants people to know how special Jesus is and how much God loves us. John is working hard to help others feel God's love, and he's excited to share the good news about how Jesus can save us and make us part of God's happy family forever!"
\v 25 "Some of John's friends were talking with a Jewish man about how people can show their love for God through baptism. Baptism is a special way to say, 'I believe in Jesus!' It helps us feel clean and shows that we want to be part of God's happy family! John was teaching everyone that by being baptized, they are expressing their love for Jesus and getting closer to God!"
\v 26 Some of John’s friends came to him and said, "Hey, John! Remember that special man you told us about by the river? He is now helping many people get closer to God by baptizing them, and lots of people want to follow Him! You told us He is really important, and look how many friends He has now! You’ve been doing such a great job telling everyone about Jesus!" John felt really happy because he loved sharing the good news about Jesus and helping everyone see how special He is!
\v 27 "John said, 'Remember, no one can have good things unless God gives them! I’m here to happily tell you about Jesus, who is super special and our Savior! It brings me so much joy to share how wonderful He is because everything good comes from God! This means God wants everyone to enjoy His love and be part of His family! So, let's believe in Jesus together!'"
\v 28 "You all remember that I said, 'I’m not the Savior; I’m just here to tell everyone about Jesus!' I'm really happy to share the good news because Jesus is special and brings us closer to God's love!"
\v 29 John the Baptist said, 'Jesus is like a groom at a wedding, and I’m so happy to be His best friend! When I hear Jesus’ voice, it fills my heart with joy, just like everyone feels at a wedding! I’m really excited because Jesus brings us so much love and happiness! I want everyone to know how wonderful He is and follow Him!'
\v 30 John the Baptist said, 'Jesus should be the most important one in our hearts! I feel so happy when I can help others learn about Him because He is our Savior! It makes me glad to see Him shine bright, and I'm joyful to step back so that everyone can see how amazing He is! Jesus fills our lives with love and happiness!'
\v 31 "Jesus is super special because He comes from heaven! He is greater than anyone on earth and shares the most important things about God’s love. When we listen to Him, we learn just how much God cares for us!"
\v 32 "Jesus tells us important things that He has learned from God. When we listen to Him, we discover just how much God loves us! But some people do not believe what Jesus says, and that is sad because they miss out on feeling God’s amazing love. Trusting in Jesus is very important because it helps us enjoy that love every day!"
\v 33 "When you believe what Jesus says, it's like saying a big 'Yes!' to the truth that God loves us! This means you really understand how much God cares for you. Believing in Jesus is super important because it helps us feel God's love every day and shows that we trust what Jesus shares with us about God!"
\v 34 "God sent Jesus to share His important message with us because He loves everyone so much! Jesus is very special and is filled with God's Spirit, which helps Him tell us about God's love. So let’s listen to Jesus, as He shows us how to feel God's love every day!"
\v 35 "God loves His Son, Jesus, so very much! He has given Jesus special powers to help people, like healing them and showing them how to feel God's love! When we believe in Jesus, we can also feel God's wonderful love in our lives! Let's trust in Jesus together!"
\v 36 "If you believe in Jesus, you get to have a special life with God that lasts forever! But if you don’t believe in Him, you will miss out on this wonderful life with God. God loves you so much and wants you to feel that love every day! So it's really important to trust in Jesus, because He makes everything better!"
