\v 1 One night, a man named Nicodemus came to visit Jesus. He was a Pharisee, which means he was a teacher about God and a leader in the Jewish community. Nicodemus wanted to ask Jesus some questions and understand His teachings better.
\v 2 One night, a Jewish leader named Nicodemus came to talk to Jesus because he wanted to understand Him better. He said, 'Teacher, we know you are someone special who has come from God. Only God could help someone do the amazing things you do.'
\v 3 Jesus replied, "Listen closely! Unless someone is born again, they cannot see the wonderful world where God is King."
\v 4 
\v 4-5 Nicodemus asked Jesus, "How can someone be born again when they are already old? Can they enter their mom's tummy again to be born?" Jesus replied, "Listen carefully! No one can enter God's Kingdom unless they are born of water, like when we are baptized, and born of the Spirit, which means God gives us a new heart and life. We must let Jesus be our Savior to be born again!"
\v 6 When a person is born as a baby, they come from their mom. But when someone is born from God's Spirit, they receive a special gift from God that changes them inside. It's like getting a new heart full of love and courage to live in God's family, starting a fresh and happy life with His help.
\v 7 So, don't be surprised when I say that everyone needs to be 'born again' to join God's family and feel His love in their hearts. It's like getting a special new life from God that makes everything brighter and happier!.
\v 8 The wind blows wherever it wants, and you can hear it, but you don’t see where it comes from or where it goes. It’s just like the Holy Spirit! When you believe in Jesus and are 'born again,' the Spirit does something amazing inside you. You might not see it happen, but it helps you follow God and be part of His family, which is really special.
\v 9 Nicodemus was really confused and said, "How can someone be born again? What does that mean? I don’t understand how it works! When we believe in Jesus, God’s Spirit makes us new inside, so we can follow Him and be part of His family."
\v 10 Jesus replied, 'You are a teacher for the people of Israel, and you should know about these big ideas! It’s surprising that you don’t understand them!'
\v 11 
\v 11-12 "I really want you to listen! We talk about what we know and what we’ve learned from God, but you don’t believe us. If I tell you about things that happen here on Earth and you don’t trust me, how will you believe when I talk about things from God’s special home in heaven? Believing is very important!"
\v 13 No one has ever gone to Heaven, except for Jesus. He is the Son of Man who came down from Heaven. Jesus knows everything about Heaven because He is the only one who has been there. He tells us the truth about it.
\v 14 Just like Moses lifted a snake up on a pole in the desert to help the people who were sick, Jesus will also be lifted up. If we look to Him and believe in Him, we can be saved. Just like the people needed to trust and look at the snake to get better, we need to trust Jesus to save us because He is God's Son.
\v 15 So anyone who believes in Jesus will not be lost but will live forever with God. Just like the people who looked at the snake and were healed, if we trust Jesus, He will help us and give us happiness that lasts forever with God.
\v 16 God loves everyone in the world so much that He gave us His one and only Son, Jesus. If you believe in Jesus and trust Him, you will never be lost; instead, you will have a happy life forever with God.
\v 17 God didn’t send His Son to tell us who is bad. He sent Him so that everyone in the world who trusts in Jesus can be saved and have a special life with God forever.
\v 18 If you believe in God’s Son, you will be safe and have a wonderful life with Him forever. But if you don’t believe, you won’t be with God and that means you’re missing out on His love and happiness forever.
\v 19 Here’s the important part: God sent Jesus to be like a bright light that shows us how to live. But some people loved their wrong choices (or sins) more than this light. They didn’t want to change and chose to stay in the darkness, missing out on God’s love. Choosing the darkness means they won’t be close to God and His happiness.
\v 20 Some people do wrong things, and they don't want anyone to see them, so they stay away from God's light. But God's light helps us see how much He loves us and shows us the right way to live. When we stay in the dark, we miss out on God's love and the happiness that comes from being close to Him. God wants us to admit our wrong choices and come into His light, where we can be forgiven and make better decisions.
\v 21 But those who are honest and do what is right come to God's light so everyone can see that their good actions show they love God and want to follow Him.
\v 22 After that, Jesus and His helpers went to Judea. There, they talked to the people about God's love and how to be kind to one another. Jesus baptized people in water as a special way to show they were choosing to follow Him and wanted to be a part of God's family. This was an important step to help them live the way God wants us to live.
\v 23 At the same time, John the Baptist was near a place called Aenon, close to Salim. There was lots of water there! Many people came to John because they wanted to be baptized. This meant they wanted to say, 'I love God and I want to follow Him more.' John was helping them get ready to follow Jesus and be part of God's family.
\v 24 At that time, John the Baptist was still free, and many people came to him to be baptized. They wanted to show that they loved God and wanted to follow Him. Baptism is a special way to show we are part of God's family.
\v 25 Some of John’s friends were talking to a Jewish man. They were asking him about the ways people can be made clean and how to please God. They wanted to learn about special things, like washing or purification, that help show love for God.
\v 26 Some of John's friends came to him and said, "Teacher, remember that special man you talked about who was with you on the other side of the river? He's the one you said would help people get closer to God. Now he is baptizing people, which is an important way for them to show they want to follow God, and everyone is going to him!"
\v 27 John answered, "No one can get anything good unless it is given to them from heaven. Just like how you feel happy when you get a gift, everything we have comes from God in heaven!"
\v 28 You all know I said, 'I am not the Christ. I am just a person God sent to tell everyone about Him.'
\v 29 Jesus is like a groom who has his bride. John is like the friend who stands next to the groom and is very happy when he hears the groom's voice. I feel happy too because I know how special it is to follow Jesus.
\v 30 Jesus is the one everyone should pay attention to because He is so special, and I am happy to step back like a good friend so that everyone can see how wonderful He is.
\v 31 Jesus comes from heaven, and He is the most special person ever. People here talk about things that don’t matter as much, but Jesus tells us the truth about God because He knows everything from above.
\v 32 Jesus has seen and heard wonderful things from God, and He shares these special truths with us. Even though some people don’t believe what He says, His words are very important because they come straight from God.
\v 33 When you trust what Jesus tells us, you are saying that God is really true.
\v 34 God sent Jesus to tell us what He says. Jesus speaks God's words because He has God's Spirit completely and does not hold back at all. This shows us that Jesus is very special and speaks the truth that God wants us to hear.
\v 35 God loves Jesus a lot and has given Him power over everything. This shows how close they are. Because Jesus is God's Son, He helps us and keeps us safe.
\v 36 If you believe in Jesus, you get to live forever with God. But if you don’t believe in Him, you won’t have this special life. Instead, God is sad because He loves everyone and wants them to pick Him to be their friend.
