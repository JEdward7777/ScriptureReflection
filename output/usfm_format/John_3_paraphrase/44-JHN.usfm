\v 1 There was a man named Nicodemus, a Pharisee and a ruler of the Jews.
\v 2 He came to Jesus at night and said, "Rabbi, we know that you are a teacher who has come from God. No one could perform the signs you are doing if God were not with him."
\v 3 Jesus answered him, "Truly, truly, I say to you, unless someone is born again, he cannot see the Kingdom of God."
\v 4 Nicodemus said to Him, "How can a person be born when they are old? Can they enter their mother's womb a second time and be born?"
\v 5 Jesus answered, "Truly, truly, I say to you, unless one is born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter the kingdom of God."
\v 6 That which is born from the flesh is just flesh, and that which is born from the Spirit is spirit.
\v 7 Do not be surprised that I told you, 'You must be born again from above.'
\v 8 The wind blows wherever it wants. You hear its sound, but you can't tell where it comes from or where it goes. This is how it is with everyone born of the Spirit.
\v 9 Nicodemus answered and said to Him, "How can these things be?"
\v 10 Jesus answered and said to him, "You are the teacher of Israel, and you do not know these things?"
\v 11 Truly, truly, I say to you, we speak about what we know, and we testify about what we have seen; yet you do not accept our testimony.
\v 12 If I told you about earthly things and you do not believe, how will you believe if I tell you about heavenly things?
\v 13 And no one has gone up to heaven except the one who came down from heaven, the Son of Man who is in heaven.
\v 14 And just as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, so must the Son of Man be lifted up.
\v 15 So that everyone who believes in him may not be lost, but may have eternal life.
\v 16 For God loved the world so much that He gave His one and only Son, so that everyone who believes in Him will not perish but have everlasting life.
\v 17 For God did not send His Son into the world to judge the world, but to save the world through Him.
\v 18 Whoever believes in Him is not judged; but whoever does not believe is already judged because they have not believed in the name of God's one and only Son.
\v 19 And this is the judgment: that light has come into the world, but people loved the darkness more than the light because their deeds were evil.
\v 20 For everyone who does evil hates the light and will not come to the light, so that their deeds will not be exposed.
\v 21 But whoever lives by the truth comes into the light, so that it may be seen clearly that what they have done has been done in God.
\v 22 After this, Jesus and his disciples went into the Judean countryside, where he spent time with them and baptized.
\v 23 John was also baptizing in Aenon, near Salim, because there was much water there, and people were coming and being baptized.
\v 24 For John had not yet been put in prison.
\v 25 Then a discussion arose between some of John's disciples and a Jew about purification.
\v 26 They came to John and said to him, 'Rabbi, the man who was with you on the other side of the Jordan, the one you testified about, look, he is baptizing, and everyone is going to him.'
\v 27 John answered, 'A person cannot receive anything unless it has been given to him from heaven.'
\v 28 You yourselves can tell me that I said, 'I am not the Christ, but I am the one who was sent before Him.'
\v 29 The one who has the bride is the bridegroom. The friend who stands by and listens to him is full of joy at the bridegroom's voice. So my joy is complete.
\v 30 He must become greater, but I must become less.
\v 31 The One who comes from above is above all. The one who is from the earth belongs to the earth and speaks as one from the earth; the One who comes from heaven is above all.
\v 32 He testifies to what he has seen and heard, yet no one accepts his testimony.
\v 33 Whoever accepts his testimony has confirmed that God is truly truthful.
\v 34 For the one whom God has sent speaks the words of God, for God gives the Spirit without measure.
\v 35 The Father loves the Son and has given everything into His hands.
\v 36 Whoever believes in the Son has eternal life; but whoever does not obey the Son will not see life, but the wrath of God remains on them.
