\v 1 One night, a leader of the Jews named Nicodemus came to see Jesus. He was a Pharisee, which means he was a very important teacher who followed God's rules. Nicodemus was curious and wanted to learn more about who Jesus was and what he taught.
\v 2 One night, a Jewish teacher named Nicodemus, who was a Pharisee and a very important leader, came to learn from Jesus. He said, 'Rabbi, we know you are from God because no one can do the amazing things you do unless God is with him.'
\v 3 Jesus answered him, 'Listen closely! You need to start over in a new way to be part of God's Kingdom.'
\v 4 
\v 4-5 Nicodemus asked Jesus, "How can someone be born again when they are already old? Can they go back into their mom's tummy to be born?" Jesus replied, "Listen carefully! No one can see God's Kingdom unless they start fresh in a special way. This means they need to be born of water, which is what happens when we get baptized, and also born from God's Spirit, which helps us believe and have a new heart. This new life is all about trusting in Jesus to save us!"
\v 6 When a baby is born, they come from their mom, which is physical birth. But when someone believes in Jesus, they have a special spiritual birth through God's Spirit. This means they get a new heart that helps them trust in Jesus and be part of God’s family. Just like when we get baptized, we show that we believe in Jesus. This new life helps us love others and live happily with God's help!
\v 7 So, don’t be surprised when I say that everyone must believe in Jesus to be 'born again' and be part of God’s family. It’s like receiving a special new life from God through His Spirit. This new heart helps us love others more and enjoy every day with God’s joy!.
\v 8 Just like the wind blows wherever it wants and you can hear it but can’t see where it comes from or where it goes, that’s how the Holy Spirit works in our lives. When you believe in Jesus and become part of God’s family, the Spirit helps change your heart. You can’t see it happening, but you can feel the love for God and others growing inside you. That’s a really special gift from God!.
\v 9 Nicodemus was really confused and asked, "How can someone be born again? What does that mean?" He didn’t understand it at all.
\v 10 Jesus said, 'You teach the people of Israel, so you should understand how God works. It's strange that you don't know this yet!'
\v 11 
\v 11-12 "I’m telling you the truth! We share what we know and have seen about God, but you still don’t believe us. If I talk to you about things we see on Earth and you don’t believe me, how can you trust me when I talk about things in Heaven? Believing in God is really important because it helps you understand more about Him!"
\v 13 No one has gone up to Heaven except the one who came down from Heaven—Jesus, the Son of Man. He knows everything about Heaven because He has been there. When He talks to us, He tells us what is true, and believing in Him helps us understand God and feel His love better!
\v 14 Just like Moses lifted a snake on a pole to help people feel better when they were sick, Jesus will be lifted up too. When we look at Him and believe in Him, we can be saved and have a special life forever with God. Just like the people needed to look at the snake to get well, we need to look to Jesus and trust Him to save us because He is God’s Son who loves us very much!
\v 15 So, everyone who trusts in Jesus, who is God's special Son, will not be lost but will have a wonderful life forever with God. Just like the people looked at the snake on the pole to feel better, we can look to Jesus and believe in Him to save us and give us life that never ends with God.
\v 16 God loves everyone in the world so much that He gave us His one and only Son, Jesus. If you believe in Him, you will never be lost, which means you won't be away from God. Instead, you will have eternal life with God forever!
\v 17 God didn't send His Son, Jesus, to tell us what we did wrong. He sent Jesus because He loves us a lot! If we trust in Jesus, He can save us from our mistakes and help us have a wonderful life with God that lasts forever.
\v 18 If you believe in God’s Son, Jesus, you will be safe with Him and have Him close to you forever. But if you don’t believe, you are already far away from Him, which means you won't be close to Him for always.
\v 19 Here’s what’s important: God sent Jesus to be a bright light that helps us know how to do good things. But some people choose to do bad things and stay in the dark, which means they are far away from God. When they turn away from the light, they aren’t able to feel God's love and happiness. This choice is serious, and it means they are not living the way God wants them to live.
\v 20 Some people choose to do bad things, and they run away from God’s light because they are scared of getting in trouble. But God’s light is here to show us His love and help us make better choices. When we stay in the dark, we miss out on feeling God's happiness and love. God really wants us to come into His light, tell Him when we’ve made mistakes, and let Him help us do what is right.
\v 21 But when people are honest and do what is right, they come into God’s light. This helps others see that their good choices come from God and shows that they really want to follow Him.
\v 22 After that, Jesus and His followers went to Judea. There, Jesus taught the people about God and how to love each other. He baptized people in water to show they were sorry for their wrong choices and wanted to follow Him as their Lord. This baptism was a special way for them to join God's family, showing they were committed to living in the way God wants us to live.
\v 23 At that same time, John the Baptist was baptizing people at a place called Aenon, near Salim, where there was lots of water. Many people came to him because they wanted to show they were sorry for their wrong choices and needed a fresh start with God. Baptism was a special way for them to say, 'I love God and want to follow Jesus!' John was helping them promise to follow God and be part of His family, just like Jesus was teaching.
\v 24 At that time, John the Baptist was not in prison yet, and he was still teaching people about God. Many came to him to be baptized because they wanted to say they were sorry for their wrong choices and start fresh with God. Baptism was a special sign that showed they loved God and wanted to follow Jesus, just like John was teaching them to do.
\v 25 Some of John the Baptist’s friends were talking to a Jewish man. They were curious about what it means to be clean in God's eyes and how to make God happy. They wanted to learn more about baptism, which is a way to show God that you’re sorry for your mistakes and want to start fresh, just like John taught people to do.
\v 26 Some of John's friends came to him and said, "Teacher, do you remember that special man you told us about? That's Jesus! He is baptizing people now, and everyone is going to see Him. Baptism shows that people want to love and follow God, just like you taught them to do. It's a way to say they're sorry for their mistakes and want to start fresh with God!"
\v 27 John answered, "You know, no one can have good things unless God gives them. It's just like a birthday when you get a present; you can only have it if someone gives it to you. Remember, all good things, like love, joy, and everything we have, come from God in heaven!"
\v 28 John the Baptist said, 'You all remember that I told you I am not the Christ, the one everyone has been waiting for. I am like a friend who helps point people to Him. God sent me to share His message and prepare everyone for Jesus.'
\v 29 John said, 'Jesus is like a groom who loves his bride. I am like a friend who helps the groom. When I hear the groom's voice, I feel really happy! My joy is complete because I get to point everyone to Jesus. He's the one we've been waiting for.'
\v 30 Jesus is the most special one, and He should be the star! I'm really happy to help everyone see how amazing He is, even if I have to step back a little. That makes my heart smile! It's like I want Jesus to become even greater, while I cheer for Him from the side, like a good friend who wants the best for Him.
\v 31 Jesus came down from heaven, and He is the most special one, the Son of God! People on earth can only share what they understand, which is often not complete. But Jesus knows everything about God because He speaks from heaven, where He can see everything clearly and knows the truth. That's why He is greater than everyone else!
\v 32 Jesus has seen and heard important things from God, and He tells us what they are. Many people do not believe what He says, and it’s sad because His words are true and come directly from God, even if no one accepts His message.
\v 33 When we believe what Jesus tells us, we are saying that God is telling the truth. Jesus shares important messages from God, and it’s really special because it helps us know what is true about God.
\v 34 God sent Jesus to share what He says. Jesus talks about God's words because He has the Holy Spirit with Him all the time, and He tells us everything that God wants us to know. This shows us how special Jesus is, and we can trust Him completely to tell us the truth about God.
\v 35 God loves Jesus very much and has given Him the power to do everything. Because of this special love, Jesus is like a superhero who helps us and keeps us safe. He knows all that God wants us to do, and He shares that with us, so we can trust Him completely to guide us and protect us.
\v 36 If you believe in Jesus, you will have forever happiness with God. But if you don’t believe in Him, you won’t get to enjoy this special life. Instead, God feels sad because He wants everyone to choose to love and trust Him, just like Jesus does.
