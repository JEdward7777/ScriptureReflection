\v 1 One day, there was a man named Nicodemus. He was a Pharisee, which means he was a teacher and leader who followed God's laws closely. The Pharisees were important because they helped people understand how to live according to God's rules. Nicodemus wanted to learn more about God and believed that Jesus could teach him, so he decided to go visit Jesus.
\v 2 One night, Nicodemus came to see Jesus. He said, 'Teacher, we know you are special because you do amazing things that only God can help you do.'
\v 3 Jesus answered, "Listen closely! You must believe in me and let God help you change your heart. If you don’t, you can’t see where God is in charge, which is a special place full of His love!"
\v 4 None
\v 4-5 Nicodemus was puzzled and said, "How can an old person start fresh? Can someone really go back inside their mom to be born again?" Jesus answered, "Listen carefully! To be a part of God’s family, you need to be born from water, which is baptism, and also from God’s Spirit. When you believe in me and get baptized, God changes your heart and makes you new inside!"
\v 6 "When a baby is born, they come from their mom. But when you believe in Jesus and get baptized, God gives you His Spirit. This means you become part of God's family!"
\v 7 "Don't be surprised that I said you need to be born again. This means you need to trust in Jesus and let God's Spirit help you become part of His family!"
\v 8 "You know how the wind blows wherever it wants, and we can feel it and hear it, but we can’t see where it comes from or where it goes. Just like that, when someone believes in Jesus, God's Spirit changes them inside. You can see the good things they do because of this change, showing that they are part of God's family!"
\v 9 Nicodemus was confused and asked Jesus, "How can a person really start over? I don’t understand how this can happen!"
\v 10 Jesus said to Nicodemus, 'You teach others about God, so it's surprising that you don't understand how special God's love is! These ideas are really important because they help everyone know how they can be close to God. Understanding this helps you teach others about how much God cares for all of us.'
\v 11 None
\v 11-12 "I want you to know something very important! We talk about what we know about God, but many people don’t believe what we say. If you find it hard to trust what I say about everyday things, how can you believe the amazing things I tell you about Heaven? You need to believe in me to understand how much God loves you and wants to help you!"
\v 13 "No one can go to Heaven by themselves. Only Jesus can show us how to be close to God. When you believe in Him, you are welcomed into God's loving family forever!"
\v 14 "Just like Moses lifted a snake on a stick in the desert to help the people who were sick, Jesus will be lifted up on the cross to help us. If you look at Jesus and believe in Him, you will be saved and get to live with God forever!"
\v 15 "When you believe in Jesus, you show that you trust God's love for you. God wants everyone to feel safe and happy with Him forever. By trusting Jesus, you become part of His family and experience His love in your heart!"
\v 16 "God loves everyone so much that He gave us His only Son, Jesus. If you believe in Him, you will have a wonderful life forever with God. Believing in Jesus means trusting Him to be your friend and helper, just like having a superhero who always cares for you!"
\v 17 "God didn’t send His Son, Jesus, to judge us. He sent Him to save us and help everyone who believes in Him become part of God's loving family!"
\v 18 "If you believe in Jesus, you are safe in God's family and filled with His love. But if you don’t believe in Him, you miss out on all the wonderful love God wants to give you. God really wants everyone to feel close to Him and be happy!"
\v 19 "Here’s what happens: God sent Jesus, who is like a bright light, into the world. Some people choose to stay away from Him because they feel bad about the wrong things they do. They don't want others to see their mistakes. But God loves us so much and wants us to come to Jesus, the light, so we can be happy and do good things together!"
\v 20 "People who do wrong actions often stay away from Jesus because they feel ashamed and guilty about what they have done. They think if they hide, no one will see their sins. But Jesus loves everyone so much and wants to help us turn away from our wrong actions. He invites us to come to Him, so we can be forgiven and feel happy again!"
\v 21 "When people choose to do what is right, it shows that they trust God. They are happy to let others see how God helps them live good lives and share His love with everyone!"
\v 22 "After that, Jesus and His friends went to a place called Judea. They spent time with the people there and helped them understand God's love. They baptized many of them because baptism is a special way to show that we are sorry for our wrong choices and want to follow Jesus. It helps us grow closer to God and shows how much Jesus cares for everyone!"
\v 23 "At that time, John the Baptist was in a place with lots of water, and he was baptizing people. Baptism is a special way to show we are sorry for our wrong choices and want to follow Jesus. John wanted everyone to believe in Jesus because He loves us very much and can help us be close to God!"
\v 24 "At that time, John the Baptist was still telling people about God’s love and helping them get ready to meet Jesus. He wanted everyone to know how special Jesus is and how much He can help us feel close to God!"
\v 25 "Some of John’s friends asked a Jewish man, ‘How can we be close to God and feel clean inside?’ They wanted to know how saying sorry for our mistakes and getting baptized helps us be part of God’s loving family. Baptism shows that we want to follow Jesus, who loves us so much!"
\v 26 Some of John's friends came to him and said, "Teacher, remember Jesus, the one you told us about? He is baptizing people, and everyone is going to Him!" John was happy to hear this because he knew his job was to help people see how great Jesus is.
\v 27 John replied, "Listen, I can only share what God has given me to say. I’m not the star of the show; I’m just here to tell everyone how amazing Jesus is! It makes me so happy to help people see how much God loves us through Him!"
\v 28 "I want you to remember that I am not the special Savior, Jesus. My job is to help you know Him better and to show you how much He loves us. I am like a friend helping everyone understand how important Jesus is!"
\v 29 "Jesus is like a bridegroom, and His followers are like a bride. I am just the bridegroom's friend, and I am so happy to hear Jesus’ voice because it shows that many people want to follow Him. My joy is knowing that Jesus loves everyone and helps us be close to God!"
\v 30 "Jesus should be the main focus for everyone. I am here to help people see how wonderful He is and how much He loves us. My happiness comes from seeing others want to know and follow Him!"
\v 31 "Jesus came from heaven, and He is the Son of God. He knows everything about God and teaches us how to love Him. When we believe in Jesus, we can be happy and close to God forever!"
\v 32 "Jesus has seen and heard many wonderful things from God, and He tells us about God's love. But some people do not want to listen to Jesus. When they choose not to believe in Him, they miss knowing God's love and being part of His happy family. It’s super important to believe in Jesus because that’s how we can feel God’s joy and love in our lives!"
\v 33 "When you believe what Jesus teaches, it shows you trust that God tells the truth. This belief helps you be part of God's family, and that’s really special!"
\v 34 "God sent Jesus to tell us important things about love! Jesus speaks clearly about what God wants us to know, and God gives Him the Holy Spirit to help us understand. The Holy Spirit guides us to love others, just like Jesus teaches us!"
\v 35 "God loves Jesus very much and has given Him the power to help everyone. When we believe in Jesus, we can feel that love in our hearts. This love makes us feel happy and safe forever with Him!"
\v 36 "Everyone who believes in God’s Son, Jesus, will have a joyful life forever with Him! But if someone chooses not to believe, they miss the chance to be part of God’s happy family, and that makes God sad because He loves everyone so much!"
