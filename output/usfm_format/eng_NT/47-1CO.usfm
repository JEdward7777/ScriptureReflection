\v 1 Paul, called as an apostle of Jesus Christ through the will of God, and Sosthenes our brother,
\v 2 To the church of God which is in Corinth, to those who are sanctified in Christ Jesus, called to be saints, together with all who in every place call upon the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, both theirs and ours:
\v 3 Grace and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
\v 4 I always give thanks to my God for you, because of the grace of God that was given to you in Christ Jesus.
\v 5 that you have been enriched in Him in every way, in all speech and in all knowledge.
\v 6 just as the testimony about Christ was confirmed among you,
\v 7 so that you do not lack any spiritual gift as you eagerly await the revelation of our Lord Jesus Christ.
\v 8 He will also confirm you until the end, so that you will be blameless on the day of our Lord Jesus Christ.
\v 9 God is faithful, by whom you were called into the fellowship of His Son, Jesus Christ our Lord.
\v 10 Now I urge you, brothers, by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that you all speak the same thing and that there be no divisions among you, but that you be united in the same mind and in the same judgment.
\v 11 For it has been reported to me concerning you, my brothers, by those of Chloe's household, that there are quarrels among you.
\v 12 Now I say this, that each of you says, 'I am of Paul,' 'I am of Apollos,' 'I am of Cephas,' or 'I am of Christ.'
\v 13 Is Christ divided? Was Paul crucified for you? Or were you baptized in the name of Paul?
\v 14 I give thanks to God that I baptized none of you except Crispus and Gaius.
\v 15 so that no one may say that they were baptized in my name.
\v 16 I also baptized the household of Stephanas; beyond that, I do not recall if I baptized anyone else.
\v 17 For Christ did not send me to baptize, but to proclaim the gospel, not with eloquent wisdom, so that the cross of Christ would not be emptied of its power.
\v 18 For the message of the cross is foolishness to those who are perishing, but to us who are being saved, it is the power of God.
\v 19 For it is written: 'I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, and the discernment of the discerning I will thwart.'
\v 20 Where is the wise one? Where is the scribe? Where is the debater of this age? Has not God made foolish the wisdom of this world?
\v 21 For since, in the wisdom of God, the world did not know God through its own wisdom, it pleased God to save those who believe through the foolishness of preaching.
\v 22 For indeed, the Jews ask for signs, and the Greeks seek wisdom.
\v 23 But we preach Christ crucified, a stumbling block to the Jews and foolishness to the Gentiles.
\v 24 But to those who are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ is the power of God and the wisdom of God.
\v 25 For the foolishness of God is wiser than men, and the weakness of God is stronger than men.
\v 26 Consider your calling, brothers and sisters, that not many of you were wise according to worldly standards, not many were powerful, not many were of noble birth.
\v 27 But God chose what is foolish in the world to shame the wise, and God chose what is weak in the world to shame the strong.
\v 28 And God chose the lowly things of the world, and the despised, and the things that are not, to bring to nothing the things that are.
\v 29 so that no one may boast in His presence.
\v 30 But it is from Him that you are in Christ Jesus, who has become for us wisdom from God, and righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption.
\v 31 So that, as it is written, 'Let the one who boasts, boast in the Lord.'
\c 2
\p
\v 1 And I, when I came to you, brothers, did not come with superiority of speech or wisdom, proclaiming to you the testimony of God.
\v 2 For I determined not to know anything among you except Jesus Christ, and Him crucified.
\v 3 And I came to you in weakness and in fear and with much trembling.
\v 4 And my message and my preaching were not in persuasive words of human wisdom, but in the demonstration of the Spirit and of power.
\v 5 so that your faith would not rest on the wisdom of men, but on the power of God.
\v 6 Yet, we speak wisdom among those who are mature; a wisdom not of this age nor of the rulers of this age, who are passing away.
\v 7 But we speak of God’s wisdom in a hidden mystery, the wisdom that was concealed, which God predetermined before the ages for our glory.
\v 8 None of the rulers of this age understood this; for if they had known, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory.
\v 9 But as it is written: 'What no eye has seen, nor ear heard, nor the heart of man conceived, these are the things that God has prepared for those who love Him.'
\v 10 But God has revealed them to us through His Spirit; for the Spirit searches all things, even the deep things of God.
\v 11 For who among men knows the things of a man except the spirit of the man which is in him? Likewise, no one knows the things of God except the Spirit of God.
\v 12 Now we have received, not the spirit of the world, but the Spirit which is from God, that we might know the things freely given to us by God.
\v 13 These things we also speak, not in words taught by human wisdom, but in those taught by the Spirit, comparing spiritual things with spiritual.
\v 14 But the natural person does not accept the things of the Spirit of God, for they are foolishness to him; and he is not able to understand them, because they are spiritually discerned.
\v 15 But the spiritual person examines all things, yet he himself is not subject to anyone’s scrutiny.
\v 16 For who has known the mind of the Lord that he may instruct Him? But we have the mind of Christ.
\c 3
\p
\v 1 And I, brethren, could not speak to you as to spiritual people, but as to carnal, as to babes in Christ.
\v 2 I fed you with milk and not solid food, for you were not yet able to receive it. And even now, you are still not able, for you are still worldly.
\v 3 For you are still worldly, since there is jealousy and strife among you. Are you not worldly? Are you not acting like mere humans?
\v 4 For when one says, ‘I belong to Paul,’ and another says, ‘I belong to Apollos,’ are you not acting like mere humans?
\v 5 What then is Paul? And what is Apollos? They are simply servants through whom you came to believe, each according to the role the Lord has assigned.
\v 6 I planted the seed, Apollos watered it, but God is the one who caused it to grow.
\v 7 So neither the one who plants nor the one who waters is anything, but only God, who causes the growth.
\v 8 Now he who plants and he who waters are one; but each will receive his own reward according to his own labor.
\v 9 For we are co-workers in God’s service; you are God’s field, God’s building.
\v 10 According to the grace of God given to me, as a wise master builder, I have laid a foundation, and another builds upon it. Let each one take heed how he builds on it.
\v 11 For no one can lay a foundation other than that which is laid, which is Jesus Christ.
\v 12 Now if anyone builds upon this foundation with gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, or straw,
\v 13 The quality of each person's work will become evident, for the day will reveal it; it will be tested by fire, and the fire will demonstrate what kind of work it is.
\v 14 If anyone's work remains that he has built upon the foundation, he will receive a reward.
\v 15 If anyone's work is burned up, he will suffer loss, but he himself will be saved, yet so as through fire.
\v 16 Do you not realize that you are a temple of God and that the Spirit of God dwells in you?
\v 17 If anyone destroys the temple of God, God will destroy that person; for the temple of God is holy, and you are that temple.
\v 18 Let no one deceive himself. If anyone among you thinks he is wise in this age, let him become a fool, that he may become wise.
\v 19 For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God. For it is written: 'He catches the wise in their own craftiness.'
\v 20 And again, the Lord knows the thoughts of the wise, that they are futile.
\v 21 So let no one boast in men, for all things are yours.
\v 22 whether Paul or Apollos or Cephas or the world or life or death or present things or future things, all are yours.
\v 23 But you belong to Christ, and Christ belongs to God.
\c 4
\p
\v 1 Let a person regard us in this way: as servants of Christ and stewards of the mysteries of God.
\v 2 Moreover, it is required of stewards that one be found faithful.
\v 3 As for me, it matters very little that I am judged by you or by any human court; indeed, I do not even judge myself.
\v 4 For I am not aware of anything against myself; yet I am not thereby acquitted. It is the Lord who examines me.
\v 5 Therefore do not judge anything before the appointed time, until the Lord comes, who will bring to light the hidden things of darkness and disclose the motives of the hearts. Then each will receive praise from God.
\v 6 Now, brothers, I have applied these things to myself and Apollos for your benefit, so that in us you may learn not to go beyond what is written, and that none of you may be puffed up in favor of one against another.
\v 7 For who regards you as superior? And what do you have that you did not receive? If you did indeed receive it, why do you boast as though you had not received it?
\v 8 Already you are filled! Already you have become rich! You have begun to reign without us—indeed, I wish you did reign, so that we might share in that reign with you!
\v 9 For I think that God has displayed us, the apostles, last of all, like those sentenced to death; for we have become a spectacle to the world, both to angels and to men.
\v 10 We are regarded as fools for Christ's sake, but you are considered wise in Christ; we are weak, but you are strong; you are esteemed, but we are dishonored.
\v 11 To this very hour we hunger and thirst; we are poorly clothed, beaten, and homeless.
\v 12 And we labor, working with our own hands. When we are insulted, we bless; when we are persecuted, we endure.
\v 13 When we are slandered, we plead for understanding; we have become like the scum of the earth, the refuse of all things, even until now.
\v 14 I do not write these things to shame you, but as my beloved children, I admonish you.
\v 15 For though you may have countless teachers in Christ, you do not have many fathers; for in Christ Jesus, through the gospel, I became your father.
\v 16 Therefore, I urge you, be imitators of me.
\v 17 For this reason, I have sent you Timothy, who is my beloved and faithful child in the Lord. He will remind you of my ways in Christ, just as I teach everywhere in every church.
\v 18 Now some of you have become arrogant as though I were not coming to you.
\v 19 But I will come to you quickly, if the Lord wills, and I will know not the words of the arrogant, but the power behind them.
\v 20 For the kingdom of God does not consist in words, but in power.
\v 21 What do you prefer? Shall I come to you with a rod, or in love and with a spirit of gentleness?
\c 5
\p
\v 1 It is widely reported among you that there is immorality, and such immorality as is not even named among the Gentiles, that a man has his father's wife.
\v 2 And you are arrogant! Should you not rather have mourned, so that the one who has committed this deed might be removed from among you?
\v 3 For I, although absent in body but present in spirit, have already judged the one who has done this thing as though I were present.
\v 4 In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, when you are gathered together with my spirit, along with the power of our Lord Jesus Christ,
\v 5 Hand this man over to Satan for the destruction of the flesh, so that his spirit may be saved on the day of the Lord Jesus.
\v 6 Your boasting is not good. Do you not know that a little leaven leavens the whole lump?
\v 7 Clean out the old leaven, that you may be a new batch, just as you are unleavened. For Christ, our Passover, has been sacrificed for us.
\v 8 Therefore, let us celebrate the feast, not with the old leaven, the leaven of malice and wickedness, but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth.
\v 9 I have written to you in my letter not to associate with those who engage in sexual immorality.
\v 10 But I did not mean that you should completely avoid contact with those who engage in sexual immorality, or with greedy persons, or with swindlers, or with idolaters; otherwise, you would have to leave this world.
\v 11 But now I have written to you not to associate with anyone who claims to be a brother, yet engages in sexual immorality, greed, idolatry, slander, drunkenness, or swindling. With such a person, do not even eat.
\v 12 For what have I to do with judging those outside the church? Is it not those inside the church whom you are to judge?
\v 13 But God will judge those outside. Remove the wicked person from among yourselves.
\c 6
\p
\v 1 Does any of you, when he has a matter against another, dare to go to law before the unjust instead of before the saints?
\v 2 Do you not know that the saints will judge the world? And if the world is judged by you, are you unworthy to judge the smallest matters?
\v 3 Do you not know that we will judge angels? How much more, then, matters of this life?
\v 4 If you have judgments concerning matters of this life, why do you appoint those who are regarded as of no account in the church to decide?
\v 5 I say this to your shame. Is there not a wise person among you, not even one who is able to mediate between his brothers?
\v 6 But instead, brother goes to law against brother, and that before unbelievers.
\v 7 Indeed, it is already a defeat for you that you have lawsuits against one another. Why not rather suffer wrong? Why not rather be defrauded?
\v 8 But you wrong one another and defraud, even your own brothers?
\v 9 Or do you not know that the unrighteous will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived: neither the sexually immoral, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor men who practice homosexuality,
\v 10 nor greedy, nor thieves, nor drunkards, nor slanderers, nor swindlers will inherit the kingdom of God.
\v 11 And such were some of you. But you were washed, you were sanctified, you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and by the Spirit of our God.
\v 12 "All things are lawful for me," but not everything is beneficial; "all things are lawful for me," but I will not be dominated by anything.
\v 13 Food is meant for the stomach, and the stomach for food; but God will bring both to an end. The body is not meant for sexual immorality, but for the Lord, and the Lord for the body.
\v 14 And God raised the Lord, and He will also raise us up by His power.
\v 15 Do you not know that your bodies are members of Christ? Shall I then take the members of Christ and make them members of a prostitute? Certainly not!
\v 16 Or do you not know that he who is joined to a prostitute becomes one body with her? For it is said, 'The two shall become one flesh.'
\v 17 But he who is joined to the Lord is one spirit with Him.
\v 18 Flee from sexual immorality. Every other sin a person commits is outside the body, but the one who engages in sexual immorality sins against his own body.
\v 19 Or do you not realize that your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit within you, whom you have from God? You are not your own.
\v 20 For you were bought with a price. Therefore, glorify God in your body and in your spirit, which are God's.
\c 7
\p
\v 1 Now concerning the matters you wrote about, it is good for a man not to engage intimately with a woman.
\v 2 But because of sexual immorality, each man should have his own wife, and each woman her own husband.
\v 3 The husband should fulfill his marital duty to his wife, and likewise the wife to her husband.
\v 4 The wife does not have authority over her own body, but the husband does; and likewise, the husband does not have authority over his own body, but the wife does.
\v 5 Do not deprive one another, except with consent for a limited time, so that you may devote yourselves to prayer; and come together again, so that Satan does not tempt you because of your lack of self-control.
\v 6 But I say this as a concession, not as a command.
\v 7 For I wish that all people were as I am; but each has his own gift from God, one in this way and another in that.
\v 8 To the unmarried and the widows, I say: it is good for them to remain as I am.
\v 9 But if they cannot exercise self-control, let them marry; for it is better to marry than to be consumed with passion.
\v 10 To the married, I command—yet not I, but the Lord—that a wife should not separate from her husband.
\v 11 But if she does separate, let her remain unmarried, or be reconciled to her husband; and let not a husband divorce his wife.
\v 12 To the rest I say, not the Lord: If any brother has an unbelieving wife and she is willing to live with him, he should not divorce her.
\v 13 And if a woman has a husband who is an unbeliever, and he is willing to live with her, she should not divorce him.
\v 14 For the unbelieving husband is made holy through his wife, and the unbelieving wife is made holy through her husband. Otherwise, your children would be unclean, but now they are holy.
\v 15 But if the unbeliever departs, let them depart. A brother or a sister is not bound in such cases. For God has called us to peace.
\v 16 For how do you know, O wife, whether you will save your husband? Or how do you know, O husband, whether you will save your wife?
\v 17 Nevertheless, let each one walk according to the gift God has given him, and as the Lord has called him. Thus I instruct in all the churches.
\v 18 Was anyone called while circumcised? Let him not become uncircumcised. Was anyone called while uncircumcised? Let him not be circumcised.
\v 19 For circumcision is nothing, and uncircumcision is nothing, but keeping the commandments of God is what matters.
\v 20 Let each person remain in the state in which he was called.
\v 21 Were you called while a slave? Do not let that trouble you; but if you can become free, take the opportunity.
\v 22 For the one who was called in the Lord while a slave is the Lord's freedman; likewise, he who was called while free is Christ's slave.
\v 23 You were bought with a price; do not become servants of men.
\v 24 So, brothers and sisters, let each one remain with God in the condition in which he was called.
\v 25 Now concerning the unmarried women, I have no command from the Lord, but I give my opinion as one who has been shown mercy by the Lord to be faithful.
\v 26 Therefore, I consider it best for a person to remain as they are because of the present distress, as it is good for a person to be in such a condition.
\v 27 Are you bound to a wife? Do not seek to be free. Are you free from a wife? Do not seek a wife.
\v 28 But if you do marry, you have not sinned; and if a virgin marries, she has not sinned. However, those who marry will face challenges in this life, and I want to spare you that.
\v 29 This is what I mean, brothers: the time is limited. So, from now on, those who have wives should live as if they do not.
\v 30 And those who weep, as though they were not weeping, and those who rejoice, as though they were not rejoicing, and those who buy, as though they possessed nothing.
\v 31 And those who are engaged with the affairs of this world should act as though they were not engaged, for the form of this world is passing away.
\v 32 But I want you to be free from anxiety. The unmarried man cares for the things of the Lord, how he may please the Lord.
\v 33 But he who is married is anxious about the things of the world, how he may please his wife.
\v 34 There is a distinction between a woman and a virgin. The unmarried woman cares about the things of the Lord, that she may be holy in both body and spirit; but she who is married cares about the things of the world, how she may please her husband.
\v 35 And I say this for your own benefit, not to put a restraint upon you, but for the sake of promoting good order and securing undistracted devotion to the Lord.
\v 36 But if anyone thinks he is behaving improperly toward his virgin, if she is past the prime of life, and if it must be so, let him do what he wishes. He does not sin; let them marry.
\v 37 But if someone stands firm in their heart, having no necessity but has control over their own will, and has decided this in their heart to keep his own virgin, he does well.
\v 38 So then, he who marries does well, but he who does not marry does even better.
\v 39 A wife is bound by law as long as her husband lives; but if her husband dies, she is free to marry whom she wishes, only in the Lord.
\v 40 But she will be happier if she remains as she is, in my opinion; and I think that I also have the Spirit of God.
\c 8
\p
\v 1 Now concerning food offered to idols, we know that we all possess knowledge. However, knowledge puffs up, but love builds up.
\v 2 If anyone thinks he knows something, he has not yet come to know as he ought to know.
\v 3 But if anyone loves God, he is known by Him.
\v 4 Therefore, concerning the eating of food offered to idols, we know that an idol is nothing in the world, and that there is no other God but one.
\v 5 For even if there are so-called gods, whether in heaven or on earth—as indeed there are many so-called gods and many lords,
\v 6 Yet for us there is one God, the Father, from whom are all things and for whom we exist, and one Lord, Jesus Christ, through whom are all things and through whom we exist.
\v 7 However, not everyone possesses this knowledge. Some, through their conscience being weak, still eat food offered to idols as if it were something sacrificial, and their conscience is defiled.
\v 8 But food does not commend us to God. We are no better if we eat, and no worse if we do not eat.
\v 9 But beware that this liberty of yours does not become a stumbling block to those who are weak.
\v 10 For if someone sees you, who have knowledge, reclining at a table in an idol’s temple, will not his conscience, being weak, be emboldened to eat the things offered to idols?
\v 11 And so, by your knowledge, the brother who is weak perishes, for whom Christ died.
\v 12 Thus, by sinning against the brothers and wounding their weak conscience, you are sinning against Christ.
\v 13 Therefore, if food causes my brother to stumble, I will never eat meat again, so that I may not cause my brother to stumble.
\c 9
\p
\v 1 Am I not an apostle? Am I not free? Have I not seen Jesus Christ our Lord? Are not you my work in the Lord?
\v 2 If I am not an apostle to others, surely I am to you; for you are the seal of my apostleship in the Lord.
\v 3 This is my defense to those who examine me.
\v 4 Do we not have the right to eat and drink?
\v 5 Do we not have the right to lead about a believing wife, as do the other apostles and the brothers of the Lord and Cephas?
\v 6 Or do only I and Barnabas not have the right to refrain from working?
\v 7 Who serves as a soldier at his own expense? Who plants a vineyard and does not eat of its fruit? Or who shepherds a flock and does not drink from the milk of the flock?
\v 8 Am I speaking these things merely from a human perspective? Or does not the Law also say the same?
\v 9 For it is written in the law of Moses: 'You shall not muzzle an ox while it is treading out the grain.' Is God concerned only for oxen?
\v 10 Or does he speak entirely for our sake? It was for our sake that this was written, that he who plows should plow in hope, and he who threshes in hope should be partaker of that hope.
\v 11 If we have sown spiritual things among you, is it too much if we reap material things from you?
\v 12 If others share in this right of ours, should we not have even more? Yet we have not made use of this right. Instead, we endure all things so that we may not hinder the gospel of Christ.
\v 13 Do you not know that those who serve in the temple eat the food from the temple, and those who attend to the altar share in the offerings of the altar?
\v 14 In the same way, the Lord has commanded that those who proclaim the gospel should earn their living by the gospel.
\v 15 But I have not used any of these rights. And I am not writing this to secure any such provision; for I would rather die than have anyone deprive me of my reason to boast.
\v 16 For if I preach the gospel, I have no reason to boast; for necessity is laid upon me. Woe to me if I do not preach the gospel!
\v 17 For if I do this willingly, I have a reward; but if against my will, I am entrusted with a stewardship.
\v 18 What then is my reward? That when I preach the gospel, I may present it without charge, so as not to misuse my authority in the gospel of Christ.
\v 19 For though I am free from all men, I have made myself a servant to all, that I might win more of them.
\v 20 And to the Jews I became as a Jew, so that I might win the Jews; to those under the Law, I became as one under the Law, so that I might win those under the Law.
\v 21 To those outside the law, I became as one outside the law—though I am not without the law of God, but under the law of Christ—so that I might win those outside the law.
\v 22 To the weak, I became weak, that I might win the weak; I have become all things to all people, so that by all means I might save some.
\v 23 I do all this for the sake of the gospel, that I may become a partaker of it with others.
\v 24 Do you not know that those who run in a race all run, but one receives the prize? Run in such a way that you may obtain it.
\v 25 Every athlete exercises self-control in all things. They do it to receive a perishable crown, but we an imperishable one.
\v 26 Therefore, I run in such a way as not without a goal; I box in such a manner as not beating the air.
\v 27 But I discipline my body and bring it into subjection, lest after preaching to others, I myself should become disqualified.
\c 10
\p
\v 1 For I do not want you to be unaware, brothers, that our forefathers were all under the cloud, and all passed through the sea.
\v 2 and all were baptized into Moses in the cloud and in the sea.
\v 3 And all ate the same spiritual food.
\v 4 And all drank the same spiritual drink, for they drank from the spiritual rock that followed them, and that rock was Christ.
\v 5 Yet God was not pleased with most of them; their bodies were scattered in the wilderness.
\v 6 Now these things took place as examples for us, so that we might not desire evil as they did.
\v 7 Do not become idolaters, as some of them were; as it is written, 'The people sat down to eat and drink, and rose up to revel.'
\v 8 Let us not engage in sexual immorality, as some of them did, and twenty-three thousand fell in a single day.
\v 9 Nor should we test Christ, as some of them did and were destroyed by serpents.
\v 10 Nor should you complain, as some of them did and were destroyed by the destroyer.
\v 11 These things happened to them as examples, and were written down as warnings for us, upon whom the end of the ages has come.
\v 12 Therefore, let anyone who thinks he stands take heed lest he fall.
\v 13 No temptation has overtaken you that is not common to man. God is faithful, and he will not let you be tempted beyond your ability, but with the temptation he will also provide the way of escape, that you may be able to endure it.
\v 14 Therefore, my beloved, flee from idolatry.
\v 15 I speak to you as wise people; judge for yourselves what I say.
\v 16 Is not the cup of blessing that we bless a participation in the blood of Christ? Is not the bread that we break a participation in the body of Christ?
\v 17 Because there is one bread, we who are many are one body, for we all partake of the one bread.
\v 18 Consider Israel according to the flesh: Are not those who eat the sacrifices partakers of the altar?
\v 19 What am I saying then? That an idol is anything? Or that what is offered to idols is anything?
\v 20 Rather, what I am saying is that the sacrifices of the nations are offered to demons and not to God; and I do not want you to become participants with demons.
\v 21 You cannot drink the cup of the Lord and the cup of demons; you cannot partake of the table of the Lord and the table of demons.
\v 22 Or do we provoke the Lord to jealousy? Are we stronger than He?
\v 23 "All things are permissible for me, but not all things are beneficial; all things are permissible for me, but not all things edify."
\v 24 Let no one seek his own good, but the good of his neighbor.
\v 25 Eat whatever is sold in the meat market, without raising any question on the ground of conscience.
\v 26 For the earth is the Lord's, and everything in it.
\v 27 If an unbeliever invites you to a meal and you choose to go, eat whatever is set before you, asking no questions for the sake of conscience.
\v 28 But if someone tells you, ‘This has been offered in sacrifice to an idol,’ do not eat it, for the sake of the one who informed you, and for the sake of conscience. For the earth is the Lord's, and everything in it.
\v 29 I mean not your own conscience, but the conscience of the other. For why should my freedom be judged by someone else's conscience?
\v 30 If I partake with gratitude, why am I slandered for that for which I give thanks?
\v 31 So, whether you eat or drink, or whatever you do, do all to the glory of God.
\v 32 Be sensitive to all—both Jews and Greeks, and to the Church of God.
\v 33 Just as I try to please everyone in all things, not seeking my own advantage, but that of many, so that they may be saved.
\c 11
\p
\v 1 Be imitators of me, as I am of Christ.
\v 2 I commend you, brothers, that you remember me in everything and maintain the teachings just as I delivered them to you.
\v 3 But I want you to understand that the head of every man is Christ, the head of the woman is her husband, and the head of Christ is God.
\v 4 Every man who prays or prophesies with his head covered brings shame upon his head.
\v 5 But every woman who prays or prophesies with her head uncovered dishonors her head; for it is one and the same as if her head were shaved.
\v 6 For if a woman does not cover her head, let her also be shorn; but if it is shameful for a woman to be shorn or shaved, let her cover her head.
\v 7 For a man ought not to cover his head, being the image and glory of God; but woman is the glory of man.
\v 8 For man does not come from woman, but woman comes from man.
\v 9 And indeed, man was not created for the sake of the woman, but woman for the sake of man.
\v 10 For this reason, a woman should have a symbol of authority on her head because of the angels.
\v 11 However, in the Lord, neither is man independent of woman, nor woman independent of man.
\v 12 For just as woman came from man, so also man is born through woman; but all things come from God.
\v 13 Judge for yourselves: is it proper for a woman to pray to God with her head uncovered?
\v 14 Does not nature itself teach you that if a man has long hair, it is a disgrace to him?
\v 15 But if a woman has long hair, it is her glory? For her hair is given to her as a covering.
\v 16 But if anyone is inclined to be contentious, we have no such custom, nor do the churches of God.
\v 17 Now in giving this instruction, I do not praise you, since your gatherings are not resulting in a better condition, but in a worse one.
\v 18 For first of all, when you come together as a church, I hear that there are divisions among you, and I partly believe it.
\v 19 For there must be factions among you, so that those who are genuine may be recognized among you.
\v 20 When you come together, it is not possible to eat the Lord's Supper.
\v 21 For in eating, each one goes ahead with his own meal, and one goes hungry while another gets drunk.
\v 22 What? Do you not have houses to eat and drink in? Or do you despise the church of God and shame those who have nothing? What shall I say to you? Shall I commend you in this? I do not commend you!
\v 23 For I received from the Lord what I also delivered to you, that the Lord Jesus, on the night he was betrayed, took bread; and when he had given thanks, he broke it and said,
\v 24 "Take, eat; this is my body, which is broken for you. Do this in remembrance of me."
\v 25 In the same manner, He took the cup after supper, saying, 'This cup is the new covenant in My blood; do this as often as you drink it, in remembrance of Me.'
\v 26 For as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup, you proclaim the Lord's death until He comes.
\v 27 Therefore, whoever eats this bread or drinks this cup of the Lord in an unworthy manner will be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord.
\v 28 But let a person examine himself, and so let him eat of the bread and drink of the cup.
\v 29 For anyone who eats and drinks without recognizing the body of the Lord eats and drinks judgment upon themselves.
\v 30 That is why many among you are weak and ill, and some have fallen asleep.
\v 31 For if we were to properly judge ourselves, we would not be judged.
\v 32 But when we are judged by the Lord, we are being disciplined so that we may not be condemned along with the world.
\v 33 Therefore, my brothers, when you come together to eat, wait for one another.
\v 34 But if anyone is hungry, let him eat at home, so that when you come together, it will not be for judgment. As for the other matters, I will set them in order when I come.
\c 12
\p
\v 1 Now concerning spiritual gifts, brothers, I do not want you to be uninformed.
\v 2 You know that when you were Gentiles, you were carried away to mute idols, however you were led.
\v 3 Therefore, I want you to understand that no one speaking by the Spirit of God says, 'Jesus be cursed,' and no one can say, 'Jesus is Lord,' except by the Holy Spirit.
\v 4 Now there are varieties of gifts, but the same Spirit.
\v 5 And there are varieties of services, but it is the same Lord who is served.
\v 6 And there are different workings, but it is the same God who is at work in all things.
\v 7 To each one is given the manifestation of the Spirit for the benefit of all.
\v 8 For to one is given through the Spirit the word of wisdom, and to another the word of knowledge according to the same Spirit.
\v 9 To another, faith by the same Spirit; to another, gifts of healing by the one Spirit.
\v 10 to another, workings of miracles; to another, prophecy; to another, discerning of spirits; to another, various kinds of tongues; to another, the interpretation of tongues.
\v 11 But all these things are empowered by one and the same Spirit, who distributes to each one individually as He wills.
\v 12 For just as the body is one and has many members, and all the members of that one body, being many, are one body, so also is Christ.
\v 13 For by one Spirit we were all baptized into one body, whether Jews or Greeks, whether slaves or free, and we were all made to drink of one Spirit.
\v 14 For the body is not one member, but many.
\v 15 If the foot should say, 'Because I am not a hand, I am not a part of the body,' would it therefore cease to be part of the body?
\v 16 And if the ear says, 'Because I am not an eye, I am not part of the body,' is it therefore not part of the body?
\v 17 If the whole body were an eye, where would the hearing be? If the whole were hearing, where would the sense of smell be?
\v 18 But now God has arranged each one of the members in the body just as He desired.
\v 19 But if all were one member, where would the body be?
\v 20 But now, there are many members, yet one body.
\v 21 The eye cannot say to the hand, ‘I have no need of you’; nor again the head to the feet, ‘I have no need of you.’
\v 22 But much more, those members of the body that seem to be weaker are indispensable.
\v 23 And those parts of the body that we consider less honorable, we bestow greater honor upon; and our unpresentable parts are treated with even greater modesty.
\v 24 But our more presentable parts have no need for special treatment. Yet God has composed the body, giving greater honor to the parts that lacked it.
\v 25 so that there may be no division in the body, but that its members may have the same care for one another.
\v 26 And if one member suffers, all the members suffer together; if one member is honored, all the members rejoice together.
\v 27 Now you are the body of Christ, and each one of you is a part of it.
\v 28 And God has appointed in the church first apostles, second prophets, third teachers, then miracles, followed by gifts of healing, assistance, leadership, and various kinds of tongues.
\v 29 Are all apostles? Are all prophets? Are all teachers? Do all work miracles?
\v 30 Do all have gifts of healing? Do all speak in tongues? Do all interpret?
\v 31 But earnestly desire the greater gifts. And yet, I will show you a way that surpasses all.
\c 13
\p
\v 1 If I speak in the tongues of men and of angels, but do not have love, I am nothing more than a resounding gong or a clanging cymbal.
\v 2 And if I possess the gift of prophecy and understand all mysteries and all knowledge; and if I have all faith so as to remove mountains, but do not have love, I am nothing.
\v 3 And if I were to give away all my possessions, and if I were to surrender my body to be burned, but do not have love, I gain nothing.
\v 4 Love is patient; love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud.
\v 5 It does not behave inappropriately, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily provoked, it does not take account of wrongs.
\v 6 It does not rejoice in unrighteousness, but rejoices with the truth.
\v 7 Love always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres.
\v 8 Love never fails. But where there are prophecies, they will cease; where there are tongues, they will be stilled; where there is knowledge, it will pass away.
\v 9 For we know in part and we prophesy in part;
\v 10 But when the perfect comes, that which is partial will be done away with.
\v 11 When I was a child, I spoke like a child, I thought like a child, I reasoned like a child; but when I became a man, I put away childish things.
\v 12 For now we see in a mirror dimly, but then we shall see face to face. Now I know in part, but then I shall know fully, even as I have been fully known.
\v 13 And now these three remain: faith, hope, and love. But the greatest of these is love.
\c 14
\p
\v 1 Pursue love earnestly, and strive for spiritual gifts, especially that you may prophesy.
\v 2 For he who speaks in a tongue does not speak to men, but to God; indeed, no one understands him; he utters mysteries in the Spirit.
\v 3 But the one who prophesies speaks to men for their edification, encouragement, and consolation.
\v 4 The one who speaks in a tongue edifies himself, but the one who prophesies builds up the church.
\v 5 I desire that all of you would speak in tongues, but even more, that you would prophesy; for the one who prophesies is greater than the one who speaks in tongues, unless he interprets, so that the church may receive edification.
\v 6 Now, brothers, if I come to you speaking in tongues, how will I benefit you unless I speak to you either by revelation, knowledge, prophecy, or teaching?
\v 7 Yet even lifeless instruments, whether flute or harp, if they do not produce distinct notes, how will anyone recognize what is played?
\v 8 And if the trumpet produces an unclear sound, who will prepare for battle?
\v 9 So likewise you, unless you speak with a clear and meaningful word, how will what is spoken be recognized? For you will be speaking into the air.
\v 10 There are, undoubtedly, many different languages in the world, and none of them is without meaning.
\v 11 Therefore, if I do not grasp the meaning of the voice, I will be a foreigner to the one speaking, and the one speaking will be a foreigner to me.
\v 12 So it is with you; since you are zealous for spiritual gifts, seek to excel in building up the church.
\v 13 Therefore, let the one who speaks in a tongue pray that he may interpret.
\v 14 For if I pray in a tongue, my spirit prays, but my mind is unfruitful.
\v 15 What is the conclusion then? I will pray with my spirit, but I will also pray with my understanding; I will sing with my spirit, but I will also sing with my understanding.
\v 16 For if you bless with the spirit, how will he who occupies the place of the uninformed say 'Amen' at your giving of thanks, since he does not understand what you say?
\v 17 For you are giving thanks well enough, but the other person is not being built up.
\v 18 I thank my God that I speak in tongues more than all of you.
\v 19 But in the church, I would rather speak five intelligible words to instruct others than ten thousand words in a tongue.
\v 20 Brothers, do not be children in your thinking; rather, in malice be infants, but in your thinking be mature.
\v 21 In the Law it is written: 'With other tongues and through the lips of strangers I will speak to this people, and even then they will not listen to me,' says the Lord.
\v 22 So tongues are a sign not for believers but for unbelievers; while prophecy is not for unbelievers, but for believers.
\v 23 If therefore the whole church assembles together and all speak in tongues, and uninformed people or unbelievers come in, will they not say that you are out of your minds?
\v 24 But if all prophesy, and an unbeliever or an uninformed person enters, he is convicted by all, he is called to account by all.
\v 25 And thus, the hidden secrets of his heart are made manifest; and so falling down on his face, he will worship God, declaring that God is truly among you.
\v 26 What then shall we say, brothers? Whenever you come together, each of you has a psalm, a teaching, a tongue, a revelation, or an interpretation. Let all things be done for the edification.
\v 27 If anyone speaks in a tongue, let there be two or at most three, each in turn, and let someone interpret.
\v 28 But if there is no interpreter, let him keep silent in the church and speak to himself and to God.
\v 29 Let two or three prophets speak, and let the others discern.
\v 30 But if something is revealed to another who is sitting down, let the first keep silent.
\v 31 For you can all prophesy one by one, so that all may learn and all may be encouraged.
\v 32 And the spirits of the prophets are subject to the prophets.
\v 33 For God is not a God of confusion, but of peace.
\v 34 As in all the churches of the saints, let your women keep silent in the churches; for it is not permitted for them to speak, but they are to be in submission, as also the law says.
\v 35 And if they wish to learn anything, let them ask their own husbands at home; for it is shameful for women to speak in the church.
\v 36 Or did the word of God originate with you? Or are you the only ones it has reached?
\v 37 If anyone thinks he is a prophet or spiritual, let him acknowledge that the things I write to you are the commandments of the Lord.
\v 38 But if anyone chooses to be ignorant, let him remain in ignorance.
\v 39 Therefore, brothers, earnestly desire to prophesy, and do not forbid speaking in tongues.
\v 40 Let all things be done in a fitting manner and in order.
\c 15
\p
\v 1 Now, brothers, I remind you of the gospel that I preached to you, which you also received and in which you stand.
\v 2 By this gospel you are saved, if you hold firmly to the word I preached to you; otherwise, you have believed in vain.
\v 3 For I delivered to you, first of all, that which I also received: that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures.
\v 4 and that He was buried, and that He rose again the third day according to the Scriptures,
\v 5 and that He was seen by Cephas, then by the twelve.
\v 6 After that, He appeared to more than five hundred of the brothers at once, most of whom are still alive, though some have fallen asleep.
\v 7 Then He was seen by James, and later by all the apostles.
\v 8 And last of all, as if I were born out of due time, He appeared to me.
\v 9 For I am the least of the apostles, unworthy to be called an apostle, because I persecuted the church of God.
\v 10 But by the grace of God, I am what I am; and His grace toward me was not in vain. On the contrary, I worked harder than any of them, yet not I, but the grace of God that was with me.
\v 11 Whether then it is I or they, so we preach, and so you believed.
\v 12 Now, if Christ is proclaimed as raised from the dead, how can some of you say that there is no resurrection of the dead?
\v 13 But if there is no resurrection of the dead, then Christ has not been raised.
\v 14 And if Christ has not been raised, then our preaching is empty, and your faith is also empty.
\v 15 We are even found to be false witnesses of God, because we testified about God that He raised Christ, whom He did not raise if the dead are not raised.
\v 16 For if the dead do not rise, then Christ has not been raised.
\v 17 And if Christ has not been raised, your faith is futile; you are still in your sins.
\v 18 Then those who have fallen asleep in Christ have perished.
\v 19 If in this life only we have hoped in Christ, we are of all people most miserable.
\v 20 But now Christ has been raised from the dead, the firstfruits of those who have died.
\v 21 For since death came through a man, the resurrection of the dead also comes through a man.
\v 22 For as in Adam all die, so also in Christ shall all be made alive.
\v 23 But each in his own order: Christ the firstfruits, and afterward, those who belong to Christ at His coming.
\v 24 Then comes the end, when He delivers the kingdom to God the Father, after He has abolished all rule and all authority and power.
\v 25 For He must reign until He has put all His enemies under His feet.
\v 26 The last enemy to be abolished is death.
\v 27 For He has put everything in subjection under His feet. But when it says that everything has been subjected, it is clear that this does not include the One who subjected everything to Him.
\v 28 And when all things are subjected to Him, then the Son Himself will also be subjected to the One who put all things in subjection under Him, so that God may be all in all.
\v 29 Otherwise, what will those do who are baptized for the dead? If the dead do not rise at all, why then are they baptized for the dead?
\v 30 What are we doing, facing danger at every hour?
\v 31 I face death every day, and I do so by the boast I have in you, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.
\v 32 If I fought wild beasts in Ephesus merely from a human perspective, what did I gain? If the dead are not raised, "Let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we die."
\v 33 Do not be deceived; bad company corrupts good character.
\v 34 Awaken to righteousness and do not sin; for some have no knowledge of God. I speak this to your shame.
\v 35 But someone will ask, 'How are the dead raised? With what kind of body do they come?'
\v 36 You fool! What you sow does not come to life unless it dies.
\v 37 And what you sow is not the body that is to be, but a bare seed, perhaps of wheat or of some other grain.
\v 38 But God gives it a body as He has chosen, and to each seed its own body.
\v 39 Not all flesh is the same; there is one kind for humans, another kind for animals, another for fish, and another for birds.
\v 40 And there are celestial bodies, and there are terrestrial bodies; but the glory of the celestial is one kind, and the glory of the terrestrial is another.
\v 41 There is one kind of glory of the sun, and another kind of glory of the moon, and another kind of glory of the stars; for star differs from star in glory.
\v 42 So it is with the resurrection of the dead. It is sown in corruption, it is raised in incorruption;
\v 43 It is sown in dishonor; it is raised in glory. It is sown in weakness; it is raised in power.
\v 44 It is sown a natural body; it is raised a spiritual body. There is a natural body, and there is a spiritual body.
\v 45 Thus it is written, 'The first man Adam became a living being'; the last Adam became a life-giving spirit.
\v 46 But it is not the spiritual that comes first, but the natural; and afterward the spiritual.
\v 47 The first man was made from the dust of the earth; the second man is the Lord from heaven.
\v 48 As was the earthly man, so are those who are of the earth; and as is the heavenly man, so also are those who are of heaven.
\v 49 And just as we have borne the likeness of the earthly man, so shall we bear the likeness of the heavenly man.
\v 50 I declare to you, brothers and sisters, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God, nor does the perishable inherit the imperishable.
\v 51 Behold, I tell you a mystery: We will not all sleep, but we will all be changed.
\v 52 In an instant, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trumpet; for the trumpet will sound, and the dead will be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed.
\v 53 For this perishable body must be clothed with imperishability, and this mortal body must be clothed with immortality.
\v 54 But when this perishable body is clothed with imperishability, and this mortal body is clothed with immortality, then the saying that is written will come to pass: 'Death has been swallowed up in victory.'
\v 55 Where, O death, is your sting? Where, O Hades, is your victory?
\v 56 The sting of death is sin, and the power of sin is the Law.
\v 57 But thanks be to God, who gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.
\v 58 Therefore, my beloved brothers, be steadfast, immovable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, knowing that your labor is not in vain in the Lord.
\c 16
\p
\v 1 Now concerning the collection for the saints, as I directed the churches of Galatia, so you also are to do.
\v 2 On the first day of every week, each of you should set aside a sum of money in keeping with your income, so that when I come no collections will have to be made.
\v 3 When I arrive, I will send those whom you approve with letters to carry your gift to Jerusalem.
\v 4 But if it is worthy for me to go as well, they will journey with me.
\v 5 But I will come to you after I have passed through Macedonia, for I am passing through Macedonia.
\v 6 But perhaps I will stay with you, or even spend the winter, so that you may help me on my journey, wherever I go.
\v 7 For I do not wish to see you now just in passing, but I hope to spend some time with you, if the Lord permits.
\v 8 But I will remain in Ephesus until Pentecost.
\v 9 For a wide door for effective work has opened to me, and there are many adversaries.
\v 10 But if Timothy comes, see that he is with you without fear, for he is doing the work of the Lord, just as I am. Therefore, let no one despise him.
\v 11 Therefore, send him on his way in peace, so that he may come to me; for I expect him to arrive with the brothers.
\v 12 Now concerning our brother Apollos, I greatly encouraged him to visit you with the brothers; however, it was not at all his desire to come now, but he will come when he has the opportunity.
\v 13 Be watchful, stand firm in the faith, be courageous, be strong.
\v 14 Let all that you do be done in love.
\v 15 Now, brothers and sisters, I urge you to pay attention to the household of Stephanas, for they were the first converts in Achaia and have devoted themselves to the service of the saints.
\v 16 so that you may also submit to such people and to everyone who works hard and labors among you.
\v 17 I rejoice in the presence of Stephanas, Fortunatus, and Achaicus, because they have supplied what was lacking from you.
\v 18 For they have refreshed my spirit and yours. Therefore, recognize such people.
\v 19 The churches of Asia send their greetings to you. Aquila and Priscilla, along with the church that meets in their home, send their heartfelt greetings in the Lord.
\v 20 All the brothers send you greetings. Greet one another with a holy kiss.
\v 21 This greeting is written with my own hand, Paul.
\v 22 If anyone does not love the Lord Jesus Christ, let him be accursed. Come, O Lord!
\v 23 The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with you.
\v 24 My love be with all of you in Christ Jesus. Amen.
