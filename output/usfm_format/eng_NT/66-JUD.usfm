\v 1 Jude, a servant of Jesus Christ and brother of James, to those who are sanctified by God the Father and preserved in Jesus Christ, called.
\v 2 Mercy, peace, and love be multiplied to you.
\v 3 Dear friends, although I was very eager to write to you about the common salvation, I found it necessary to write to you, urging you to contend for the faith that was once for all entrusted to the saints.
\v 4 For certain individuals have secretly slipped in among you—those who were long ago marked out for this condemnation—ungodly persons who turn the grace of our God into a license for immorality and deny our only Master and Lord, Jesus Christ.
\v 5 Now I want to remind you, although you once fully knew it, that Jesus, who saved a people out of the land of Egypt, afterward destroyed those who did not believe.
\v 6 And the angels who did not keep their own position of authority but abandoned their proper dwelling, He has kept in eternal chains under darkness for the judgment of the great day.
\v 7 Just as Sodom and Gomorrah and the surrounding cities, having given themselves over to sexual immorality and pursued unnatural desires, serve as an example by undergoing a punishment of eternal fire.
\v 8 In the same way, these individuals also dream about defiling the flesh, rejecting authority, and blaspheming glorious beings.
\v 9 But Michael, the archangel, when he disputed with the devil and argued about the body of Moses, did not presume to pronounce a railing judgment against him, but said, 'The Lord rebuke you!'
\v 10 But these men blaspheme what they do not understand; and what they instinctively know, like unreasoning animals, in these things they corrupt themselves.
\v 11 Woe to them! For they have followed the way of Cain, and for pay they have rushed headlong into the error of Balaam, and in rebellion they perished like Korah.
\v 12 These are the hidden reefs in your love feasts, shamelessly feasting with you, feeding only themselves; they are clouds without water, carried along by the winds; they are autumn trees without fruit, twice dead, uprooted.
\v 13 They are wild waves of the sea, foaming up their own shame; wandering stars, for whom the blackness of darkness has been reserved forever.
\v 14 And Enoch, the seventh from Adam, prophesied about these men, saying: "Behold, the Lord comes with thousands of His holy ones."
\v 15 to execute judgment against all, and to convict all the ungodly of their deeds of ungodliness that they have committed in such an ungodly way, and of all the harsh things that ungodly sinners have spoken against Him.
\v 16 These are grumblers and fault-finders, following their own desires; they speak arrogantly, flattering others to gain an advantage.
\v 17 But you, beloved, remember the words spoken beforehand by the apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ.
\v 18 For they said to you that in the last times there will be mockers who walk according to their own ungodly desires.
\v 19 These are the ones who cause divisions; they are worldly, devoid of the Spirit.
\v 20 But you, dear friends, build yourselves up in your most holy faith and pray in the Holy Spirit.
\v 21 Keep yourselves in the love of God, eagerly awaiting the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ that leads to eternal life.
\v 22 And have mercy on those who doubt;
\v 23 Save others by snatching them from the fire; to others show mercy with fear, hating even the garment stained by the flesh.
\v 24 To Him who is able to keep you from stumbling and to present you blameless before His glory with great joy.
\v 25 To the only wise God our Savior, be glory, majesty, power, and authority, now and forever. Amen.
