\v 1 Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the command of God our Savior and of Christ Jesus our hope.
\v 2 To Timothy, my true child in the faith: Grace, mercy, and peace from God our Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.
\v 3 As I urged you to remain in Ephesus when I was heading to Macedonia, so that you may command certain individuals not to teach any different doctrine.
\v 4 nor to pay attention to myths and endless genealogies, which give rise to questions rather than the stewardship of God that is by faith.
\v 5 But the goal of our instruction is love that comes from a pure heart, a good conscience, and sincere faith.
\v 6 Some, having strayed from these things, have turned aside to meaningless discussions.
\v 7 Desiring to be teachers of the law, but not understanding either what they say or the subjects they confidently affirm.
\v 8 We know that the law is good if one uses it properly.
\v 9 Realizing this, that the law is not laid down for the righteous, but for the lawless and insubordinate, for the ungodly and sinners, for the unholy and profane, for those who kill their fathers or mothers, for murderers,
\v 10 for those who are sexually immoral, practicing homosexuality, enslavers, liars, perjurers, and whatever else is contrary to sound teaching.
\v 11 in accordance with the glorious gospel of the blessed God, with which I have been entrusted.
\v 12 I give thanks to Christ Jesus our Lord, who has strengthened me, because He considered me faithful, appointing me to His service.
\v 13 I was formerly a blasphemer, a persecutor, and an arrogant man; but I received mercy because I acted in ignorance and unbelief.
\v 14 And the grace of our Lord overflowed to me, along with faith and love that are in Christ Jesus.
\v 15 This saying is trustworthy and deserving of full acceptance: Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners, of whom I am the foremost.
\v 16 But for this very reason, I was shown mercy, so that in me, the worst of sinners, Christ Jesus might display his immense patience as an example for those who would believe in him and receive eternal life.
\v 17 Now to the King eternal, immortal, invisible, the only wise God, be honor and glory for ever and ever. Amen.
\v 18 This charge I entrust to you, son Timothy, in accordance with the prophecies previously made about you, that by them you may wage the good warfare.
\v 19 holding on to faith and a good conscience. Some, by rejecting these, have shipwrecked their faith.
\v 20 Among them are Hymenaeus and Alexander, whom I have handed over to Satan, so that they may learn not to blaspheme.
\c 2
\p
\v 1 I urge you, then, first of all, to offer petitions, prayers, intercessions, and thanksgivings for all people.
\v 2 for kings and all those in authority, that we may lead a tranquil and quiet life in all godliness and dignity.
\v 3 For this is good and pleasing in the sight of our Savior God.
\v 4 who desires all people to be saved and to come to the knowledge of the truth.
\v 5 For there is one God, and there is one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus,
\v 6 who gave Himself as a ransom for all, the testimony given at the proper time.
\v 7 For this purpose I was appointed a preacher and an apostle; I speak the truth in Christ, I do not lie; I am a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and truth.
\v 8 Therefore, I desire the men in every place to pray, lifting up holy hands without anger or disputing.
\v 9 In the same way, I also want women to adorn themselves with proper attire, modestly and with self-control, not with elaborate hairstyles, gold, pearls, or expensive clothes.
\v 10 but rather, they should show their devotion to God through good works.
\v 11 Let a woman learn in quietness and full submission.
\v 12 But I do not permit a woman to teach or to exercise authority over a man; rather, she is to remain quiet.
\v 13 For Adam was formed first, then Eve.
\v 14 And Adam was not deceived, but the woman, having been deceived, fell into transgression.
\v 15 But she will be saved through childbearing, if they continue in faith, love, holiness, and self-control.
\c 3
\p
\v 1 This is a trustworthy saying: If anyone aspires to the office of overseer, he desires a noble task.
\v 2 Therefore, an overseer must be above reproach, the husband of one wife, sober-minded, self-controlled, respectable, hospitable, and able to teach.
\v 3 He must not be a drunkard, nor violent, nor greedy for dishonest gain, but gentle, peaceable, not a lover of money.
\v 4 He must manage his own household well, with children who respect and obey him in all dignity.
\v 5 For if someone does not know how to manage his own household, how will he care for the church of God?
\v 6 He must not be a recent convert, or he may become conceited and fall into the condemnation of the devil.
\v 7 Moreover, he must have a good testimony from those outside the church, so that he will not fall into reproach and the snare of the devil.
\v 8 Likewise, deacons must be dignified, not double-tongued, not indulging in much wine, not greedy for dishonest gain.
\v 9 Holding to the mystery of the faith with a pure conscience.
\v 10 And let them first be tested; then let them serve as deacons if they are found blameless.
\v 11 In the same way, women must be dignified, not slanderers, sober-minded, faithful in all things.
\v 12 Let deacons be the husbands of one wife, managing their children and their own households well.
\v 13 For those who have served well as deacons acquire a good standing for themselves and great confidence in the faith that is in Christ Jesus.
\v 14 These things I write to you, hoping to come to you soon.
\v 15 If I delay, you may know how one ought to conduct themselves in the household of God, which is the church of the living God, a pillar and foundation of the truth.
\v 16 And undeniably, great is the mystery of godliness: He was revealed in the flesh, justified in the Spirit, seen by angels, proclaimed among the nations, believed on in the world, taken up in glory.
\c 4
\p
\v 1 Now the Spirit explicitly states that in the later times, some will renounce the faith and pay attention to deceitful spirits and the teachings of demons.
\v 2 through the hypocrisy of liars whose consciences have been seared as with a hot iron.
\v 3 They forbid marriage and advocate abstaining from certain foods, which God created to be received with thanksgiving by those who believe and know the truth.
\v 4 For every creation of God is good, and nothing is to be rejected if it is received with thanksgiving.
\v 5 For it is sanctified by the word of God and by prayer.
\v 6 If you instruct the brothers in these things, you will be a good servant of Jesus Christ, nourished in the words of faith and of the good teaching that you have closely followed.
\v 7 But reject irreverent and old wives' tales; rather, train yourself for godliness.
\v 8 For physical training is of limited value, but godliness is beneficial in every way, holding promise for the present life and for the life to come.
\v 9 This saying is trustworthy and deserves full acceptance.
\v 10 For this reason, we strive and are insulted, because we have placed our hope in the living God, who is the Savior of all people, especially of those who believe.
\v 11 Command and teach these things.
\v 12 Let no one despise your youth, but be an example to the believers in word, in conduct, in love, in spirit, in faith, in purity.
\v 13 Until I arrive, devote yourself to the public reading of Scripture, to exhortation, to teaching.
\v 14 Do not neglect the spiritual gift that is in you, which was given to you through prophecy when the elders laid their hands on you.
\v 15 Practice these things; be diligent in them, so that your progress may be evident to all.
\v 16 Pay careful attention to yourself and to your teaching; persist in this, for by doing so you will save both yourself and those who hear you.
\c 5
\p
\v 1 Do not harshly rebuke an older man, but appeal to him as you would to a father; treat younger men as brothers.
\v 2 Treat older women as mothers, and younger women as sisters, with all purity.
\v 3 Honor widows who are truly in need.
\v 4 But if a widow has children or grandchildren, they must learn first to show piety at home and to repay their parents, for this is pleasing in the sight of God.
\v 5 But she who is truly a widow, having set her hope on God, continues in prayers and supplications night and day.
\v 6 But she who lives for pleasure is dead even while she lives.
\v 7 And command these things so that they may be without blame.
\v 8 But if anyone does not take care of his own, especially those of his household, he has denied the faith and is worse than an unbeliever.
\v 9 Let no widow be enrolled unless she is not less than sixty years old, the wife of one husband.
\v 10 having a reputation for good works: if she has brought up children, shown hospitality, washed the feet of the saints, assisted those in distress, and devoted herself to every good work.
\v 11 But refuse to enroll younger widows; for when they become senseless in their desires for Christ, they wish to marry.
\v 12 They incur judgment because they have rejected their former faith.
\v 13 And besides, they learn to be idle, going about from house to house; and not only are they idle, but also gossips and busybodies, saying things which they ought not.
\v 14 Therefore, I desire that the younger widows marry, bear children, and manage their households, giving no opportunity to the adversary for slander.
\v 15 For some have already turned aside to follow Satan.
\v 16 If any believing woman has relatives who are widows, let her assist them, and do not let the church be burdened, so that it may assist those widows who are truly in need.
\v 17 Let the elders who lead well be considered worthy of double honor, especially those who labor in preaching and teaching.
\v 18 For the Scripture says, 'You shall not muzzle an ox while it is treading out the grain,' and, 'The laborer is worthy of his wages.'
\v 19 Do not accept an accusation against an elder unless it is confirmed by two or three witnesses.
\v 20 Rebuke those who persist in sin before everyone, so that the rest may take warning.
\v 21 I solemnly charge you before God and Christ Jesus and the chosen angels, to keep these instructions without bias, doing nothing out of favoritism.
\v 22 Do not hastily lay hands on anyone, nor partake in the sins of others; keep yourself pure.
\v 23 Do not continue drinking only water, but use a little wine for the sake of your stomach and your frequent ailments.
\v 24 The sins of some people are clearly evident, leading them to judgment; while others follow after.
\v 25 Likewise, good works are clearly evident, and those that are not cannot remain hidden.
\c 6
\p
\v 1 Let all who are under the yoke as servants regard their own masters as worthy of all honor, so that the name of God and the teaching may not be reviled.
\v 2 But those who have believing masters should not be disrespectful because they are brothers; rather, they should serve all the more, since those who benefit by their good service are believers and beloved.
\v 3 Teach and encourage these things. If anyone advocates a different doctrine and does not agree with the sound words of our Lord Jesus Christ and the teaching that accords with godliness,
\v 4 He is conceited, understanding nothing, but he has a morbid craving for controversy and disputes about words, from which arise envy, strife, slander, evil suspicions,
\v 5 and constant friction among people who are depraved in mind and deprived of the truth, imagining that godliness is a means of gain. Withdraw yourself from such.
\v 6 But godliness with contentment is great gain.
\v 7 For we brought nothing into the world, and it is clear that we cannot take anything out of it.
\v 8 But if we have food and clothing, with these we will be content.
\v 9 But those who desire to be rich fall into temptation and a snare, and into many foolish and harmful desires that plunge men into ruin and destruction.
\v 10 For the love of money is a root of all kinds of evil, from which some, aspiring to it, have wandered away from the faith and pierced themselves through with many sorrows.
\v 11 But you, O man of God, flee these things; and pursue righteousness, godliness, faith, love, endurance, and gentleness.
\v 12 Strive for the good fight of faith; seize the eternal life to which you were called and for which you made the good confession in the presence of many witnesses.
\v 13 I charge you in the sight of God, who gives life to all things, and of Christ Jesus, who made the good confession before Pontius Pilate.
\v 14 to keep the commandment unstained and without reproach until the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ,
\v 15 which He will display at the proper time, He who is the blessed and only Sovereign, the King of kings and Lord of lords.
\v 16 He alone possesses immortality, dwelling in unapproachable light, whom no man has seen or can see. To Him be honor and eternal dominion. Amen.
\v 17 Instruct those who are wealthy in this present age not to be proud or to set their hope on the uncertainty of riches, but on God, who richly provides us with all things to enjoy.
\v 18 Instruct them to do good, to be rich in good works, to be generous and ready to share.
\v 19 Storing up for themselves a good foundation for the future, so that they may take hold of the eternal life.
\v 20 O Timothy, guard the deposit entrusted to you, avoiding the irreverent babble and contradictions of what is falsely called knowledge.
\v 21 which some have professed and thereby wandered away from the faith. Grace be with you. Amen.
