\v 1 Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ, to the elect who are temporary residents of the dispersion in Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia,
\v 2 according to the foreknowledge of God the Father, in the sanctification of the Spirit, for obedience and the sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ: may grace and peace be multiplied to you.
\v 3 Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ! According to His great mercy, He has caused us to be born again to a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead.
\v 4 to an inheritance that is imperishable, undefiled, and unfading, kept in heaven for you.
\v 5 who are protected by the power of God through faith for a salvation ready to be revealed in the last time.
\v 6 In this you rejoice greatly, even though for a little while, if necessary, you may have to suffer through various trials.
\v 7 so that the genuineness of your faith, which is more precious than gold that perishes though it is tested by fire, may be found to result in praise, glory, and honor at the revelation of Jesus Christ.
\v 8 Though you have not seen Him, you love Him; though you do not now see Him, you believe in Him and rejoice with a joy that is inexpressible and filled with glory.
\v 9 obtaining the outcome of your faith, the salvation of your souls.
\v 10 Concerning this salvation, the prophets diligently sought and inquired, who prophesied of the grace that would come to you.
\v 11 searching carefully to know what time or manner of time the Spirit of Christ within them was indicating, as He foretold the sufferings that would come upon Christ and the glories that would follow.
\v 12 It was revealed to them that they were not serving themselves, but you, in the things that have now been announced to you through those who preached the good news to you by the Holy Spirit sent from heaven—things into which angels long to look.
\v 13 Therefore, prepare your minds for action; be sober-minded; set your hope completely on the grace that will be brought to you at the revelation of Jesus Christ.
\v 14 As obedient children, do not conform to the former desires that you had in your ignorance.
\v 15 But as the One who called you is holy, you also be holy in all your conduct.
\v 16 For it is written: 'You shall be holy, for I am holy.'
\v 17 And if you call on the Father who judges impartially according to each one's work, conduct yourselves with reverent fear during your time as strangers here.
\v 18 For you know that it was not with perishable things, such as silver or gold, that you were redeemed from the empty way of life handed down to you from your ancestors,
\v 19 but with the precious blood of Christ, like that of a lamb without blemish and without defect.
\v 20 He was chosen before the foundation of the world, but was revealed in these last times for your sake.
\v 21 Through Him, you believe in God, who raised Him from the dead and gave Him glory, so that your faith and hope are in God.
\v 22 Since you have purified your souls by obeying the truth through the Spirit for sincere brotherly love, love one another earnestly from a pure heart.
\v 23 For you have been born again, not from perishable seed, but from imperishable, through the living and abiding word of God.
\v 24 For all flesh is like grass, and all its glory is like the flower of grass; the grass withers, and the flower falls away.
\v 25 But the word of the Lord endures forever. And this is the word that was preached to you.
\c 2
\p
\v 1 Therefore, laying aside all malice, all deceit, hypocrisy, envy, and all slander,
\v 2 Like newborn infants, long for the pure spiritual milk, that by it you may grow up into salvation.
\v 3 if indeed you have tasted that the Lord is good.
\v 4 To whom coming as to a living stone, rejected indeed by men, but chosen by God and precious,
\v 5 You also, as living stones, are being built up a spiritual house, a holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices that are acceptable to God through Jesus Christ.
\v 6 For it stands in Scripture: 'Behold, I lay in Zion a chosen and precious cornerstone, and he who believes in Him will never be put to shame.'
\v 7 To you therefore, who believe, He is precious; but to those who are disobedient, the stone which the builders rejected has become the chief cornerstone.
\v 8 They stumble because they disobey the word, to which they also were appointed.
\v 9 But you are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people set apart, that you may proclaim the praises of Him who called you out of darkness into His marvelous light.
\v 10 Once you were not a people, but now you are the people of God; you had not received mercy, but now you have received mercy.
\v 11 Beloved, I urge you as sojourners and exiles to abstain from the passions of the flesh, which wage war against your soul.
\v 12 Maintain good conduct among the Gentiles, so that in the thing they slander you as evildoers, they may observe your good deeds and glorify God on the day of visitation.
\v 13 Submit yourselves, therefore, to every human authority for the Lord's sake, whether to the emperor as the supreme authority,
\v 14 or to governors, as sent by him for the punishment of those who do evil and for the praise of those who do good.
\v 15 For this is the will of God, that by doing good you should silence the ignorance of foolish men.
\v 16 Act as free people, but do not use your freedom as a cover for evil; rather, serve God as His slaves.
\v 17 Honor everyone. Love the brotherhood. Fear God. Honor the king.
\v 18 Servants, be submissive to your masters with all respect, not only to those who are kind and gentle, but also to those who are harsh.
\v 19 For this is commendable, if someone endures pain because of their conscience toward God, suffering unjustly.
\v 20 For what credit is it if you endure punishment for doing wrong? But if you endure suffering for doing good, this is commendable before God.
\v 21 For to this you were called, because Christ also suffered for you, leaving you an example that you should follow in His steps.
\v 22 Who committed no sin, nor was deceit found in His mouth.
\v 23 Who, being insulted, did not retaliate; suffering, He did not threaten, but committed Himself to Him who judges righteously.
\v 24 Who Himself bore our sins in His body on the tree, that we, having died to sins, might live for righteousness; by whose stripes you were healed.
\v 25 For you were like sheep going astray, but now you have returned to the Shepherd and Overseer of your souls.
\c 3
\p
\v 1 Likewise, wives, be submissive to your own husbands, so that even if some do not obey the word, they may be won over without a word by the conduct of their wives.
\v 2 when they observe your chaste and respectful conduct, accompanied by reverence.
\v 3 Let your adornment not be merely outward—arranging the hair, wearing gold, or putting on fine apparel;.
\v 4 But let your beauty be that of the inner person, the imperishable beauty of a gentle and quiet spirit, which is precious in the sight of God.
\v 5 For in this way, holy women of old who hoped in God adorned themselves, being submissive to their own husbands.
\v 6 just as Sarah obeyed Abraham, calling him lord. You are her daughters if you do good and do not fear anything that is frightening.
\v 7 In the same way, husbands, live with your wives in an understanding manner, showing honor to the woman as the weaker vessel, since they are heirs together of the grace of life, so that your prayers may not be hindered.
\v 8 Finally, all of you, be harmonious, sympathetic, loving as brothers, tender-hearted, and humble-minded.
\v 9 Do not repay evil for evil, or insult for insult. On the contrary, bless them, for to this you were called, that you may inherit a blessing.
\v 10 For whoever desires to love life and see good days must keep their tongue from evil and their lips from speaking deceit.
\v 11 Let him turn away from evil and do good; let him seek peace and pursue it.
\v 12 For the eyes of the Lord are on the righteous, and His ears are open to their prayer; but the face of the Lord is against those who do evil.
\v 13 And who is there to harm you if you are zealous for what is good?
\v 14 But even if you should suffer for righteousness' sake, you are blessed. And do not fear their threats, nor be troubled.
\v 15 But in your hearts set apart Christ as Lord. Always be prepared to give an answer to everyone who asks you to give the reason for the hope that you have. Yet do this with gentleness and respect.
\v 16 Keeping a good conscience, so that when they speak against you as evildoers, those who revile your good behavior in Christ may be ashamed.
\v 17 For it is better, if it is God's will, to suffer for doing good than for doing evil.
\v 18 For Christ also suffered once for sins, the righteous for the unrighteous, to bring us to God; He was put to death in the flesh, but made alive in the spirit.
\v 19 In this, He went and proclaimed to the spirits in prison,
\v 20 who once were disobedient, when God's patience waited in the days of Noah, while the ark was being prepared, in which a few, that is, eight souls, were saved through water.
\v 21 This baptism, which is an antitype, now saves us, not by the removal of dirt from the body, but as an appeal to God for a good conscience, through the resurrection of Jesus Christ.
\v 22 who has gone into heaven and is at the right hand of God, with angels and authorities and powers having been subjected to Him.
\c 4
\p
\v 1 Therefore, since Christ suffered in the flesh for us, arm yourselves also with the same mindset, because the one who has suffered in the flesh has ceased from sin.
\v 2 So as to live the rest of their time in the flesh, no longer for human desires, but for the will of God.
\v 3 For you have had enough time in the past to carry out the desires of the Gentiles, indulging in sensuality, passions, drunkenness, revelries, drinking parties, and lawless idolatries.
\v 4 With respect to this, they are surprised when you do not join them in the same flood of debauchery, and they malign you; 
\v 5 But they will give an account to him who is prepared to judge the living and the dead.
\v 6 For this reason the gospel was preached also to those who are dead, that they might be judged according to men in the flesh, but live according to God in the spirit.
\v 7 But the end of all things has drawn near. Therefore, be serious and watchful in your prayers.
\v 8 Above all, maintain fervent love for one another, because love covers a multitude of sins.
\v 9 Show hospitality to one another without complaining.
\v 10 As each one has received a gift, use it to serve one another, as good stewards of the varied grace of God.
\v 11 If anyone speaks, let him speak as one who speaks the very words of God; if anyone serves, let him serve by the strength that God provides, so that in everything God may be glorified through Jesus Christ. To Him belong glory and dominion forever and ever. Amen.
\v 12 Beloved, do not be surprised at the fiery ordeal that has come upon you, as though something strange were happening to you.
\v 13 But to the extent that you share in the sufferings of Christ, rejoice, so that when His glory is revealed, you may also rejoice with exceeding joy.
\v 14 If you are reproached for the name of Christ, you are blessed, because the Spirit of glory and of God rests upon you. On their part, He is blasphemed, but on your part, He is glorified.
\v 15 But let none of you suffer as a murderer, or a thief, or an evildoer, or as a meddler in other people's matters.
\v 16 But if anyone suffers as a Christian, let him not be ashamed, but let him glorify God in that name.
\v 17 For the time has come for judgment to begin at the house of God; and if it begins with us first, what will be the end of those who do not obey the gospel of God?
\v 18 And if the righteous are scarcely saved, where will the ungodly and the sinner appear?
\v 19 Therefore, let those who suffer according to God’s will commit their souls to a faithful Creator while doing good.

\p
\v 1 So I exhort the elders among you, as a fellow elder and a witness of the sufferings of Christ, as well as a partaker in the glory that is to be revealed:
\v 2 Shepherd the flock of God that is among you, exercising oversight, not under compulsion, but willingly, as God would have you; not for shameful gain, but eagerly.
\v 3 not as domineering over those in your charge, but being examples to the flock.
\v 4 And when the Chief Shepherd appears, you will receive the unfading crown of glory.
\v 5 Likewise, you younger ones, submit yourselves to your elders. Yes, all of you be submissive to one another, and be clothed with humility, for God opposes the proud but gives grace to the humble.
\v 6 Therefore, humble yourselves under the mighty hand of God, so that He may exalt you in due time.
\v 7 Cast all your worries upon Him, because He cares deeply for you.
\v 8 Be alert and of sober mind. Your enemy the devil prowls around like a roaring lion looking for someone to devour.
\v 9 Stand firm against him, steadfast in your faith, knowing that the same kinds of sufferings are being accomplished in your brotherhood throughout the world.
\v 10 And after you have suffered a little while, the God of all grace, who has called you to his eternal glory in Christ, will himself restore, strengthen, confirm, and establish you.
\v 11 To Him belongs the glory and the power forever and ever. Amen.
\v 12 Through Silvanus, your faithful brother, I have written to you briefly, encouraging you and solemnly testifying that this is the true grace of God in which you stand.
\v 13 She who is in Babylon, chosen together with you, sends you greetings, and so does Mark, my son.
\v 14 Greet one another with a kiss of love. Peace be to all of you who are in Christ Jesus. Amen.
