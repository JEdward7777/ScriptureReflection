\v 1 In my first account, I addressed you, O Theophilus, about all that Jesus began both to do and to teach.
\v 2 until the day when He was taken up, after He had given commands to the apostles whom He had chosen through the Holy Spirit.
\v 3 To them, he also presented himself alive after his suffering, with many convincing proofs, appearing to them over the course of forty days and speaking about the things concerning the kingdom of God.
\v 4 And while he was together with them, he commanded them not to depart from Jerusalem, but to wait for the promise of the Father, which you have heard from me.
\v 5 For John truly baptized with water, but you shall be baptized with the Holy Spirit not many days from now.
\v 6 So when they had come together, they asked Him, saying, "Lord, is this the time when You will restore the kingdom to Israel?"
\v 7 He said to them, 'It is not for you to know the times or seasons that the Father has fixed by His own authority.'
\v 8 But you will receive power when the Holy Spirit comes upon you, and you will be my witnesses in Jerusalem and in all Judea and Samaria, and to the ends of the earth.
\v 9 After he said these things, as they were watching, he was lifted up, and a cloud took him out of their sight.
\v 10 As they were intently watching him ascend into heaven, suddenly two men appeared beside them dressed in white robes.
\v 11 They said, "Men of Galilee, why do you stand looking up into the sky? This Jesus, who has been taken up from you into heaven, will come in the same way you saw him go into heaven."
\v 12 Then they returned to Jerusalem from the Mount called Olivet, which is near Jerusalem, a Sabbath day's journey away.
\v 13 And when they entered, they went up to the upper room where they were staying: Peter and John, James and Andrew, Philip and Thomas, Bartholomew and Matthew, James the son of Alphaeus, Simon the Zealot, and Judas the son of James.
\v 14 All these were continually devoting themselves with one accord to prayer, along with the women and Mary the mother of Jesus, and with His brothers.
\v 15 In those days, Peter stood up in the midst of the disciples and said, "The number of names was about one hundred twenty."
\v 16 Men, brothers, it was necessary for the Scripture to be fulfilled, which the Holy Spirit spoke beforehand through the mouth of David concerning Judas, who became a guide to those who arrested Jesus.
\v 17 For he was numbered with us and received a share in this ministry.
\v 18 Now this man acquired a field with the wages of his wrongdoing, and falling headlong, he burst open in the middle, and all his bowels gushed out.
\v 19 And it became known to all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, so much so that the place was called in their own language Akeldama, that is, the Field of Blood.
\v 20 For it is written in the book of Psalms: ‘Let his dwelling place be desolate, and let there be no one to inhabit it’; and ‘Let another take his office.’
\v 21 Therefore, it is essential that one of the men who have accompanied us during the whole time the Lord Jesus went in and out among us be chosen.
\v 22 beginning from the baptism of John until the day He was taken up from us, one of these must become a witness with us of His resurrection.
\v 23 And they appointed two: Joseph called Barsabbas, who was also known as Justus, and Matthias.
\v 24 And after praying, they said, 'You, Lord, who know the hearts of all, show us which of these two you have chosen.'
\v 25 to take the place in this ministry and apostleship from which Judas turned away to go to his own place.
\v 26 And they cast lots for them, and the lot fell on Matthias; and he was numbered with the eleven apostles.
\c 2
\p
\v 1 When the day of Pentecost had fully come, they were all together in one place, in complete harmony.
\v 2 And suddenly there came a sound from heaven, as of a rushing mighty wind, and it filled the whole house where they were sitting.
\v 3 And there appeared to them divided tongues as of fire, and one sat upon each of them.
\v 4 And all were filled with the Holy Spirit, and began to speak in different tongues as the Spirit gave them utterance.
\v 5 Now there were dwelling in Jerusalem Jews, devout men from every nation under heaven.
\v 6 When this sound occurred, the multitude came together and were bewildered, because each one heard them speaking in his own language.
\v 7 And all were astonished and wondered, saying to one another, 'Are not all these who are speaking Galileans?'
\v 8 And how is it that we each hear them speaking in our own native dialect?
\v 9 Parthians, Medes, and Elamites, and those dwelling in Mesopotamia, Judea and Cappadocia, Pontus and Asia,
\v 10 Phrygia and Pamphylia, Egypt and the parts of Libya around Cyrene, and visitors from Rome, both Jews and proselytes,
\v 11 Cretans and Arabs, we hear them speaking in our own languages the wonderful works of God.
\v 12 And all were astounded and perplexed, saying to one another, 'What could this mean?'
\v 13 But others, mocking, said, 'They are filled with sweet wine.'
\v 14 But Peter, standing with the eleven, lifted up his voice and addressed them, 'Men of Judea and all who dwell in Jerusalem, let this be known to you, and give ear to my words.
\v 15 For these men are not drunk, as you suppose; for it is only the third hour of the day.
\v 16 But this is what was spoken through the prophet Joel:
\v 17 ‘And it shall be in the last days,’ says God, ‘that I will pour out my Spirit upon all humanity; and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, your young men shall see visions, and your old men shall dream dreams.
\v 18 And even upon my servants, both men and women, I will pour out my Spirit in those days; and they shall prophesy.
\v 19 And I will grant wonders in the sky above and signs on the earth below, blood and fire and a cloud of smoke.
\v 20 The sun will be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood, before the great and glorious day of the Lord arrives.
\v 21 And it shall come to pass that everyone who calls on the name of the Lord shall be saved.
\v 22 Men of Israel, listen to these words: Jesus of Nazareth, a man attested to you by God with mighty works and wonders and signs that God did through him in your midst, as you yourselves know.
\v 23 This Jesus, delivered up according to the predetermined plan and foreknowledge of God, you crucified and killed by the hands of lawless men.
\v 24 Whom God raised up, freeing Him from the pains of death, because it was not possible for Him to be held by it.
\v 25 For David says concerning Him: ‘I constantly keep the Lord before me; for He is at my right hand, that I may not be shaken.'
\v 26 Therefore my heart was filled with joy, and my tongue exclaimed in praise; moreover, my flesh will dwell in hope.
\v 27 For You will not abandon my soul to the realm of the dead, nor will You allow Your Holy One to experience corruption.
\v 28 You have made known to me the ways of life; You will fill me with joy in Your presence.
\v 29 Brothers, I confidently say to you regarding the patriarch David that he both died and was buried, and his tomb is with us to this day.
\v 30 Therefore, being a prophet and knowing that God had sworn an oath to him, that from the fruit of his own body he would raise up Christ to sit on his throne according to the flesh,
\v 31 Foreseeing this, he spoke about the resurrection of the Christ, that His soul was not abandoned to Hades, nor did His flesh experience decay.
\v 32 This Jesus God has raised up, of which we all are witnesses.
\v 33 Therefore, having been exalted to the right hand of God and having received from the Father the promised Holy Spirit, He has poured out this which you now see and hear.
\v 34 For David did not ascend into the heavens, but he himself says: 'The Lord said to my Lord, sit at My right hand.'
\v 35 until I place your enemies as a footrest for your feet.
\v 36 Therefore, let all the house of Israel know for certain that God has made this Jesus, whom you crucified, both Lord and Christ.
\v 37 Upon hearing this, they were deeply pierced in their hearts and said to Peter and the rest of the apostles, 'Brothers, what should we do?'
\v 38 Peter replied, 'Repent, and let each of you be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins, and you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.'
\v 39 For the promise is for you and your children, and for all who are far off, as many as the Lord our God will call to Himself.
\v 40 And with many other words he earnestly testified and urged them, saying, 'Save yourselves from this crooked generation.'
\v 41 So those who joyfully accepted his message were baptized, and on that day about three thousand souls were added.
\v 42 They devoted themselves to the apostles' teaching, to the fellowship, to the breaking of bread, and to the prayers.
\v 43 Awe came upon every soul, and many wonders and signs were performed through the apostles.
\v 44 And all the believers were united and shared everything they had.
\v 45 They sold their property and possessions and distributed the proceeds to anyone in need.
\v 46 Every day, they continued to meet together in the temple courts and broke bread in their homes, sharing meals with glad and sincere hearts.
\v 47 Praising God and enjoying the goodwill of all the people. And the Lord added to their number daily those who were being saved.
\c 3
\p
\v 1 Now Peter and John went up together to the temple at the hour of prayer, the ninth hour.
\v 2 And a certain man, who had been lame from his mother’s womb, was being carried and laid daily at the gate of the temple, called Beautiful, to ask for alms from those entering the temple.
\v 3 When he saw Peter and John about to enter the temple, he asked them for money.
\v 4 But Peter, along with John, gazing intently at him, said, "Look at us."
\v 5 But he gave them his full attention, expecting to receive something from them.
\v 6 But Peter said, 'Silver and gold I do not have; but what I do have I give you. In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, rise up and walk.'
\v 7 And taking him by the right hand, he lifted him up; and immediately his feet and ankle bones received strength.
\v 8 And leaping up, he stood and walked, and entered with them into the temple, walking and leaping and praising God.
\v 9 And all the people saw him walking and praising God.
\v 10 And they recognized him as the man who used to sit by the Beautiful Gate of the temple, asking for alms; and they were filled with amazement and wonder at what had happened to him.
\v 11 And while the healed man clung to Peter and John, all the people ran together to them in the place called Solomon's Porch, astonished.
\v 12 When Peter saw this, he addressed the people: 'Men of Israel, why are you amazed at this? Or why do you stare at us as if by our own power or piety we had made this man walk?'
\v 13 The God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, the God of our fathers, has glorified His servant Jesus, whom you delivered up and denied in the presence of Pilate, when he was determined to release Him.
\v 14 But you denied the Holy One and the Just, and asked for a murderer to be granted to you.
\v 15 And you killed the Author of life, whom God raised from the dead, of which we are witnesses.
\v 16 And by faith in His name, this man whom you see and know has been made strong; it is the faith that comes through Him that has given him this complete healing in your presence.
\v 17 And now, brothers, I know that you acted in ignorance, just as your rulers did.
\v 18 But God, as He foretold through the mouth of all His prophets, has fulfilled that Christ should suffer in this way.
\v 19 Therefore, repent and return to God, so that your sins may be wiped away.
\v 20 That times of refreshing may come from the presence of the Lord, and that He may send you the appointed Christ, Jesus.
\v 21 Heaven must receive him until the time of the restoration of all things, as God spoke through the mouth of all His holy prophets since the world began.
\v 22 For Moses said to the fathers, ‘The Lord your God will raise up for you a prophet like me from among your brethren. Him you shall hear in all things that He speaks to you.'
\v 23 And it shall be that every soul who does not listen to that Prophet shall be utterly destroyed from among the people.
\v 24 Indeed, all the prophets from Samuel and those who came after him have spoken, announcing these days.
\v 25 You are the sons of the prophets and of the covenant which God made with our fathers, saying to Abraham, ‘And in your seed all the families of the earth shall be blessed.’
\v 26 For you first, God raised up His Servant Jesus and sent Him to bless you by turning each of you from your wickedness.
\c 4
\p
\v 1 While they were speaking to the people, the priests and the captain of the temple, along with the Sadducees, confronted them.
\v 2 They were greatly troubled because they were teaching the people and proclaiming in Jesus the resurrection of the dead.
\v 3 And they laid hands on them and put them in custody until the next day, for it was already evening.
\v 4 But many of those who heard the word believed, and the number of men came to be about five thousand.
\v 5 And it came to pass on the next day that their rulers, elders, and scribes were gathered together in Jerusalem.
\v 6 And Annas, the high priest, along with Caiaphas, John, Alexander, and all who were of the high-priestly descent, gathered together.
\v 7 And when they had placed them in the center, they began to inquire, "By what power or in what name have you done this?"
\v 8 Then Peter, filled with the Holy Spirit, said to them, 'Rulers of the people and elders of Israel,'
\v 9 If we are being examined today concerning a good deed done to a sick man, by what means this man has been healed,
\v 10 Let it be known to all of you and to all the people of Israel that by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom you crucified, whom God raised from the dead, by Him this man stands before you whole.
\v 11 This is the stone that was despised by you builders, which has become the cornerstone.
\v 12 And there is no salvation in any other; for there is no other name under heaven given among men by which we must be saved.
\v 13 When they observed the boldness of Peter and John, and realized that they were uneducated men and commoners, they were amazed and recognized that they had been with Jesus.
\v 14 And seeing the man who had been healed standing with them, they had nothing to say in reply.
\v 15 So they commanded them to go out of the council, and they conferred among themselves.
\v 16 Saying, 'What shall we do with these men? For a notable sign has been performed through them, and it is evident to all who dwell in Jerusalem, and we cannot deny it.'
\v 17 But in order that it may not spread further among the people, let us warn them to speak no more in this name to anyone.
\v 18 And when they called them, they commanded them not to speak at all or teach in the name of Jesus.
\v 19 But Peter and John answered them, "Whether it is right in the sight of God for us to listen to you more than to God, you judge."
\v 20 For we cannot help but speak of what we have seen and heard.
\v 21 So after further threatening them, they let them go, finding no way to punish them because of the people, for all were praising God for what had happened.
\v 22 For the man on whom this miracle of healing was performed was over forty years old.
\v 23 When they were released, they went to their own companions and reported all that the chief priests and the elders had said to them.
\v 24 And when they heard this, they lifted their voices together to God and said, 'Master, You who made heaven and earth, the sea, and everything in them...'
\v 25 You said through the mouth of Your servant David, ‘Why did the nations rage, and the peoples meditate on futile things?’
\v 26 The kings of the earth took their stand, and the rulers were gathered together against the Lord and against His Anointed.
\v 27 For truly in this city, Herod and Pontius Pilate, along with the Gentiles and the people of Israel, gathered together against Your holy servant Jesus, whom You anointed.
\v 28 to accomplish whatever Your hand and Your purpose had predetermined to take place.
\v 29 And now, Lord, look upon their threats, and grant to Your servants that with all boldness they may speak Your word.
\v 30 By stretching out Your hand to heal, and that signs and wonders may be done through the name of Your holy servant Jesus.
\v 31 And when they had prayed, the place where they were assembled was shaken; and they were all filled with the Holy Spirit and spoke the word of God with boldness.
\v 32 Now the multitude of those who believed were of one heart and one soul, and not one of them claimed that any of their possessions was their own, but they had everything in common.
\v 33 And with great power, the apostles continued to testify to the resurrection of the Lord Jesus, and abundant grace was upon them all.
\v 34 For there was not a single person in need among them. Those who owned lands or houses sold them, bringing the proceeds of the sales.
\v 35 And they laid the proceeds at the feet of the apostles; and they distributed to each one as anyone had need.
\v 36 Now Joseph, who was called Barnabas by the apostles (which means 'Son of Encouragement'), a Levite, a native of Cyprus,
\v 37 Having a field, he sold it, and brought the money and laid it at the apostles' feet.
\c 5
\p
\v 1 But a man named Ananias, with his wife Sapphira, sold a piece of property.
\v 2 And he withdrew from the honor, together with his wife, and brought a portion of the proceeds and laid it at the feet of the apostles.
\v 3 But Peter said, "Ananias, why has Satan filled your heart to lie to the Holy Spirit and keep back part of the price of the land for yourself?
\v 4 Wasn't it yours to keep? And after it was sold, wasn't the money at your disposal? Why then did you conceive this deed in your heart? You have not lied to men, but to God.
\v 5 Hearing these words, Ananias fell down and breathed his last; and great fear came upon all who heard of these things.
\v 6 But the young men arose, wrapped him up, and carrying him out, buried him.
\v 7 Now it was about three hours later when his wife came in, not knowing what had happened.
\v 8 But Peter said to her, 'Tell me, did you sell the land for this amount?' And she said, 'Yes, for that amount.'
\v 9 But Peter said to her, 'Why is it that you have agreed together to test the Spirit of the Lord? Behold, the feet of those who have buried your husband are at the door, and they will carry you out.'
\v 10 Immediately, she fell down at his feet and breathed her last. When the young men entered, they found her dead; and carrying her out, they buried her beside her husband.
\v 11 And great fear came upon the whole church and upon all who heard these things.
\v 12 And through the hands of the apostles many signs and wonders were done among the people. And they were all together in Solomon's Portico.
\v 13 Yet none of the rest dared to join them, but the people esteemed them highly.
\v 14 Yet more than ever, multitudes of both men and women were believing in the Lord.
\v 15 So that they brought the sick out into the streets and laid them on beds and couches, that at least the shadow of Peter passing by might overshadow some of them.
\v 16 Moreover, the multitude from the surrounding cities came to Jerusalem, bringing the sick and those tormented by unclean spirits; and they were all healed.
\v 17 Then the high priest rose up, and all those who were with him (that is, the sect of the Sadducees), and they were filled with jealousy.
\v 18 And they laid hands on the apostles and placed them in public custody.
\v 19 But an angel of the Lord opened the prison doors during the night, and leading them out, said,
\v 20 Go, stand in the temple and speak to the people all the words of this Life.
\v 21 And when they heard this, they entered the temple at daybreak and began teaching. But the high priest and those with him came and called together the council and all the senate of the children of Israel, and sent to the prison to have them brought.
\v 22 But when the officers arrived, they did not find them in the prison. So they returned and reported.
\v 23 saying, 'We found the prison securely locked, and the guards standing at the doors; but when we opened them, we found no one inside.'
\v 24 Now when the high priest, the captain of the temple, and the chief priests heard these words, they were perplexed about what this could mean.
\v 25 But someone came and told them, 'Look! The men whom you put in prison are standing in the temple and teaching the people.'
\v 26 Then the captain went with his officers and brought them back without using force, for they were afraid of the people, lest they should be stoned.
\v 27 When they had brought them, they set them before the council. And the high priest questioned them.
\v 28 saying, 'Did we not strictly command you not to teach in this name? And behold, you have filled Jerusalem with your teaching, and you intend to bring this man's blood upon us!'
\v 29 But Peter and the apostles answered, 'We must obey God rather than men.'
\v 30 The God of our fathers raised Jesus, whom you killed by hanging him on a tree.
\v 31 God has exalted Him to be both Leader and Savior, to grant repentance to Israel and forgiveness of sins.
\v 32 And we are witnesses of these things, and so is the Holy Spirit, whom God has given to those who obey Him.
\v 33 When they heard this, they were enraged and decided to kill them.
\v 34 But a Pharisee in the council named Gamaliel, a respected teacher of the Law, stood up and ordered that the apostles be taken outside for a brief moment.
\v 35 And he said to them, "Men of Israel, take care of yourselves regarding these men; consider what you are about to do."
\v 36 For before these days, Theudas rose up, claiming to be someone important, and a number of about four hundred men joined him. He was killed, and all who followed him were scattered and came to nothing.
\v 37 After him, Judas the Galilean arose in the days of the census and drew away a significant number of people after him. He also perished, and all who followed him were scattered.
\v 38 And now I say to you, stay away from these men and let them be; for if this counsel or work is of men, it will come to nothing.
\v 39 But if it is of God, you cannot overthrow it; lest perhaps you be found to fight against God.
\v 40 They were persuaded by him, and when they had called in the apostles, they beat them and commanded them not to speak in the name of Jesus, and let them go.
\v 41 So they went on their way from the council, rejoicing that they had been counted worthy to suffer disgrace for the name of Him.
\v 42 And every day, in the temple and from house to house, they did not cease teaching and proclaiming the good news that Jesus is the Christ.
\c 6
\p
\v 1 Now during those days, as the number of disciples was increasing, there arose a complaint from the Hellenists against the Hebrews, because their widows were being neglected in the daily distribution.
\v 2 So the Twelve gathered all the disciples together and said, "It is not right for us to neglect the ministry of the word of God in order to wait on tables."
\v 3 Therefore, brothers, select from among you seven men of good reputation, full of the Holy Spirit and wisdom, whom we may appoint to this duty.
\v 4 But we will devote ourselves to prayer and to the ministry of the word.
\v 5 And this proposal pleased the whole gathering; and they chose Stephen, a man full of faith and the Holy Spirit, and Philip, Prochorus, Nicanor, Timon, Parmenas, and Nicolas, a proselyte from Antioch.
\v 6 They presented these men to the apostles, who prayed and laid their hands on them.
\v 7 And the word of God increased, and the number of the disciples in Jerusalem multiplied greatly, and a great many of the priests became obedient to the faith.
\v 8 And Stephen, full of faith and power, did great wonders and miracles among the people.
\v 9 But some from the synagogue of the Libertines, Cyrenians, Alexandrians, and those from Cilicia and Asia arose and disputed with Stephen.
\v 10 And they were unable to withstand the wisdom and the Spirit by which he spoke.
\v 11 Then they secretly induced men to say, 'We have heard him speak blasphemous words against Moses and against God.'
\v 12 So they incited the people, the elders, and the scribes, and they came upon him, seized him, and brought him before the council.
\v 13 They set up false witnesses who said, "This man never ceases to speak words of blasphemy against this holy place and the Law."
\v 14 For we have heard him say that this Jesus of Nazareth will destroy this place and will change the customs which Moses delivered to us.
\v 15 And gazing at him, all who sat in the council saw that his face was like the face of an angel.
\c 7
\p
\v 1 Then the high priest asked, "Are these accusations true?"
\v 2 He replied, 'Brothers and fathers, listen to me! The God of glory appeared to our father Abraham while he was still in Mesopotamia, before he settled in Haran.
\v 3 And He said to him, 'Leave your land and your relatives, and come to the land that I will show you.'
\v 4 Then he left the land of the Chaldeans and settled in Haran. From there, after the death of his father, he moved him to this land where you now dwell.
\v 5 And He did not give him an inheritance in it, not even a footstep; yet He promised to give it to him as a possession and to his offspring after him, though he had no child.
\v 6 And God spoke in this way, that his descendants would be temporary residents in a foreign land, and they will be enslaved and mistreated for four hundred years.
\v 7 And the nation to which they will be enslaved, I will judge, said God; and afterward, they will come out and worship me in this place.
\v 8 And He gave him the covenant of circumcision; and thus Abraham became the father of Isaac, and he circumcised him on the eighth day. Isaac became the father of Jacob, and Jacob the father of the twelve patriarchs.
\v 9 And the patriarchs, moved by jealousy against Joseph, sold him into Egypt.
\v 10 And God was with him, and delivered him from all his afflictions, and granted him grace and wisdom in the sight of Pharaoh king of Egypt; and he made him governor over Egypt and all his household.
\v 11 But a famine came over all the land of Egypt and Canaan, and great affliction occurred, and our forefathers could find no sustenance.
\v 12 But when Jacob heard that there was grain in Egypt, he sent our forefathers there first.
\v 13 And in the second visit, Joseph was made known to his brothers, and his family lineage became evident to Pharaoh.
\v 14 Joseph sent and summoned his father Jacob and all his relatives, seventy-five souls in total.
\v 15 So Jacob went down to Egypt, and he died there, along with our ancestors.
\v 16 And they were transferred to Shechem and laid in the tomb that Abraham had purchased for a sum of silver from the sons of Hamor of Shechem.
\v 17 But as the time for the promise that God had made to Abraham approached, the people multiplied and grew strong in Egypt.
\v 18 Until another king arose who did not recognize Joseph.
\v 19 This man, having become shrewd, oppressed our fathers by making them expose their infants, so that they would not be kept alive.
\v 20 At that time, Moses was born, and he was exceptionally favored by God; he was nurtured for three months in his father's house.
\v 21 When he was abandoned, Pharaoh's daughter adopted him and raised him as her own son.
\v 22 And Moses was educated in all the wisdom of the Egyptians, and he was mighty in words and deeds.
\v 23 But when he was about forty years old, it came into his heart to visit his brothers, the children of Israel.
\v 24 And when he saw one being wronged, he defended him and avenged the oppressed by striking down the Egyptian.
\v 25 He thought that his brothers would understand that God was giving them salvation by his hand, but they did not understand.
\v 26 And on the following day, he appeared to them as they were quarreling and tried to reconcile them, saying, ‘Men, you are brothers; why do you wrong each other?’
\v 27 But the one who was wronging his neighbor pushed him away, saying, 'Who made you a ruler and judge over us?'
\v 28 Do you intend to kill me as you did the Egyptian yesterday?
\v 29 So Moses fled at this saying, and became a stranger in the land of Midian, where he had two sons.
\v 30 And after forty years had passed, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in the wilderness of Mount Sinai, in a flame of fire in a bush.
\v 31 When Moses saw it, he marveled at the sight; as he approached to examine it, there came the voice of the Lord to him.
\v 32 ‘I am the God of your forefathers, the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.’ And Moses trembled with fear and did not dare to look.
\v 33 But the Lord said to him, 'Remove the sandals from your feet, for the place where you are standing is holy ground.'
\v 34 ‘I have indeed seen the affliction of My people in Egypt, and I have heard their groaning; I have come down to deliver them. And now I am sending you to Egypt.’
\v 35 This Moses, whom they rejected, saying, 'Who made you a ruler and a judge?'—this man God sent as both ruler and deliverer, through the hand of the angel who appeared to him in the bush.
\v 36 This Moses led them out, doing wonders and signs in the land of Egypt, and in the Red Sea, and in the wilderness for forty years.
\v 37 This is the Moses who said to the Israelites, ‘The Lord your God will raise up for you a prophet from among your own brothers, just like me; him you shall hear.’
\v 38 This is the one who was among the assembly in the wilderness with the angel who spoke to him at Mount Sinai, and with our ancestors; he received living oracles to give to us.
\v 39 This is the one whose ancestors refused to obey, but rejected him, turning their hearts back to Egypt.
\v 40 saying to Aaron, 'Make us gods who will go before us; for as for this Moses who led us out of the land of Egypt, we do not know what has happened to him.'
\v 41 And in those days, they made a golden calf and offered a sacrifice to the idol, rejoicing in the works of their own hands.
\v 42 But God turned away and delivered them up to worship the host of heaven, as it is written in the book of the prophets: 'Did you bring me sacrifices and offerings in the wilderness for forty years, O house of Israel?'
\v 43 And you took up the tent of Moloch and the star of your god Rephan, the images that you made to worship; therefore, I will carry you away beyond Babylon.
\v 44 Our fathers had the tent of witness in the wilderness, just as the One who spoke to Moses directed him to make it according to the pattern he had seen.
\v 45 Which our ancestors received and brought in with Jesus during the conquest of the nations that God drove out before the face of our ancestors, until the days of David.
\v 46 Who found favor in the sight of God and asked to find a dwelling place for the God of Jacob.
\v 47 But Solomon built him a house.
\v 48 However, the Most High does not dwell in houses made by human hands, as the prophet says.
\v 49 ‘Heaven is My throne, and the earth is a footstool for My feet. What kind of house will you build for Me?’ says the Lord, ‘or what place is there for My rest?
\v 50 Did not My hand make all these things?
\v 51 You stiff-necked and uncircumcised in heart and ears! You always resist the Holy Spirit; as your fathers did, so do you.
\v 52 Which of the prophets did your fathers not persecute? And they killed those who foretold the coming of the Righteous One, whom you have now betrayed and murdered.
\v 53 You who received the law as ordained by angels, yet did not keep it.
\v 54 When they heard these things, they were cut to the heart, and they gnashed their teeth at him.
\v 55 But being full of the Holy Spirit, he gazed into heaven and saw the glory of God, and Jesus standing at the right hand of God.
\v 56 And he said, 'Behold, I see the heavens opened and the Son of Man standing at the right hand of God.'
\v 57 But they cried out with a loud voice and stopped their ears, and rushed together at him.
\v 58 And they drove him out of the city and stoned him. And the witnesses laid down their garments at the feet of a young man named Saul.
\v 59 And as they were stoning Stephen, he called out, 'Lord Jesus, receive my spirit!'
\v 60 Then kneeling down, he cried out with a loud voice, 'Lord, do not charge them with this sin.' And when he had said this, he fell asleep.
\c 8
\p
\v 1 On that day, a great persecution arose against the church in Jerusalem; and all except the apostles were scattered throughout the regions of Judea and Samaria.
\v 2 Devout men buried Stephen and made great lamentation over him.
\v 3 But Saul was wreaking havoc on the church, entering house after house and dragging off men and women, committing them to prison.
\v 4 Therefore, those who had been scattered went about preaching the word.
\v 5 Philip went down to a city in Samaria and proclaimed to them the Messiah.
\v 6 The crowds paid close attention to what Philip said, as they listened eagerly and witnessed the signs he performed.
\v 7 For unclean spirits, crying with a loud voice, came out of many who were possessed, and many who were paralyzed and lame were healed.
\v 8 So there was great joy in that city.
\v 9 But there was a certain man named Simon, who previously practiced magic in the city and amazed the people of Samaria, claiming to be someone great.
\v 10 To him all the people gave heed, from the least to the greatest, saying, 'This man is the great power of God.'
\v 11 And they paid close attention to him for a long time, because he had astonished them with his magic.
\v 12 But when they believed Philip, as he proclaimed the good news of the Kingdom of God and the name of Jesus Christ, both men and women were baptized.
\v 13 Even Simon himself believed, and after being baptized, he stayed close to Philip, amazed by the great signs and wonders he saw.
\v 14 When the apostles in Jerusalem heard that Samaria had accepted the word of God, they sent Peter and John to them.
\v 15 Who, after they came down, prayed for them that they might receive the Holy Spirit.
\v 16 For the Holy Spirit had not yet fallen upon any of them, they had only been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.
\v 17 Then they laid their hands on them, and they received the Holy Spirit.
\v 18 When Simon saw that the Spirit was given through the laying on of the apostles' hands, he offered them money.
\v 19 saying, "Give me also this authority, so that anyone on whom I lay my hands may receive the Holy Spirit."
\v 20 But Peter said to him, 'Let your silver perish with you, because you thought that the gift of God could be purchased with money.'
\v 21 You have no share or part in this matter, for your heart is not right before God.
\v 22 Therefore, repent from this wickedness of yours, and pray to the Lord that, if possible, the intent of your heart may be forgiven.
\v 23 For I see that you are in the gall of bitterness and the bond of iniquity.
\v 24 Then Simon answered, "Pray to the Lord for me, so that nothing of what you have said may come upon me."
\v 25 So, after they had testified and spoken the word of the Lord, they returned to Jerusalem, preaching the gospel in many Samaritan villages.
\v 26 But an angel of the Lord spoke to Philip, saying, 'Rise and go toward the south, to the road that goes down from Jerusalem to Gaza.' This is a desolate place.
\v 27 So he arose and went; and behold, there was an Ethiopian man, a eunuch of great authority under Candace, the queen of the Ethiopians, who was in charge of all her treasury, and had come to Jerusalem to worship.
\v 28 He was returning home, sitting in his chariot, and was reading the prophet Isaiah.
\v 29 Then the Spirit said to Philip, 'Go up and join this chariot.'
\v 30 So Philip ran up to the chariot and heard the man reading the prophet Isaiah. He asked him, 'Do you understand what you are reading?'
\v 31 He replied, 'How can I understand unless someone guides me?' And he invited Philip to come up and sit with him.
\v 32 The passage of Scripture that he was reading was this: 'Like a sheep, he was led to the slaughter; and like a lamb before its shearer, he remains silent; so he does not open his mouth.'
\v 33 In his humiliation, justice was denied him; who can recount his lineage? For his life is taken from the earth.
\v 34 The eunuch answered Philip, 'I ask you, about whom does the prophet say this? Is he speaking of himself or someone else?'
\v 35 Then Philip opened his mouth, and beginning from that Scripture, he preached the good news about Jesus to him.
\v 36 As they were traveling along the road, they came to some water; and the eunuch said, 'Look, here is water! What is preventing me from being baptized?'
\v 37 Philip said, 'If you truly believe with all your heart, you may.' And the eunuch answered, 'I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God.'
\v 38 So he commanded the chariot to stop, and they both went down into the water, Philip and the eunuch, and he baptized him.
\v 39 When they came up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord suddenly took Philip away, and the eunuch did not see him again, but went on his way rejoicing.
\v 40 But Philip found himself at Azotus; and as he passed through, he preached the gospel in all the cities until he came to Caesarea.
\c 9
\p
\v 1 Meanwhile, Saul, still breathing out threats and violence against the disciples of the Lord, approached the high priest.
\v 2 He requested letters from him to the synagogues in Damascus, so that if he found any belonging to the Way, whether men or women, he might bring them bound to Jerusalem.
\v 3 As he was journeying, it happened that he drew near to Damascus, and suddenly a light from heaven flashed around him.
\v 4 Falling to the ground, he heard a voice saying to him, 'Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting me?'
\v 5 He said, 'Who are you, Lord?' And the Lord said, 'I am Jesus, whom you are persecuting.'
\v 6 But rise and enter into the city, and you will be told what you must do.
\v 7 The men who traveled with him stood speechless, hearing the voice but seeing no one.
\v 8 So Saul got up from the ground, and though his eyes were opened, he saw nothing. Those who were with him took him by the hand and led him into Damascus.
\v 9 For three days he was without sight, and he neither ate nor drank.
\v 10 Now there was a disciple at Damascus named Ananias; and the Lord said to him in a vision, 'Ananias.' He answered, 'Here I am, Lord.'
\v 11 And the Lord said to him, 'Rise and go to the street called Straight, and inquire in the house of Judas for one named Saul of Tarsus; for behold, he is praying,'
\v 12 And he saw in a vision a man named Ananias coming in and laying his hands on him so that he might regain his sight.
\v 13 But Ananias answered, 'Lord, I have heard from many about this man, how much harm he has done to Your saints in Jerusalem.'
\v 14 And here he has the authority from the chief priests to imprison all who call upon Your name.
\v 15 But the Lord said to him, 'Go, for this man is a chosen instrument of mine to bear my name before the Gentiles and kings and the children of Israel.'
\v 16 For I will show him how much he must suffer for the sake of my name.
\v 17 So Ananias went and entered the house; and laying his hands on him, he said, 'Brother Saul, the Lord Jesus, who appeared to you on the road as you came, has sent me that you may regain your sight and be filled with the Holy Spirit.'
\v 18 And immediately something like scales fell from his eyes, and he regained his sight. Then he arose and was baptized, and after taking food, he was strengthened.
\v 19 And Saul spent several days with the disciples in Damascus, growing in strength and understanding.
\v 20 And immediately in the synagogues he proclaimed Jesus, declaring that he is the Son of God.
\v 21 All who heard him were astonished and said, "Is this not the man who wreaked havoc in Jerusalem among those who called on this name? And has he come here for this purpose, to bring them bound before the chief priests?"
\v 22 But Saul grew stronger and kept confounding the Jews who lived in Damascus, proving that this Jesus is the Christ.
\v 23 And as the days were being fulfilled, the Jews plotted together to kill him.
\v 24 But their plot against Saul became known. They watched the gates both day and night, intending to kill him.
\v 25 But the disciples took him by night and lowered him in a basket through an opening in the wall.
\v 26 When Saul arrived in Jerusalem, he tried to join the disciples, but they were all afraid of him, not believing that he was truly a disciple.
\v 27 But Barnabas took him and brought him to the apostles, and he declared to them how he had seen the Lord on the road, and that the Lord had spoken to him, and how boldly he had preached in the name of Jesus at Damascus.
\v 28 So he went in and out among them in Jerusalem, speaking boldly in the name of the Lord Jesus.
\v 29 He spoke and debated with the Hellenists, but they attempted to kill him.
\v 30 But when the brothers learned of this, they brought him down to Caesarea and sent him away to Tarsus.
\v 31 So, the churches throughout all Judea, Galilee, and Samaria enjoyed peace, being built up and walking in the fear of the Lord, and in the comfort of the Holy Spirit, they were multiplied.
\v 32 As Peter was traveling through all regions, he came down also to the saints who lived in Lydda.
\v 33 And there he found a certain man named Aeneas, who had been bedridden for eight years, for he was paralyzed.
\v 34 And Peter said to him, ‘Aeneas, Jesus Christ heals you. Rise and make your bed.’ And immediately he rose up.
\v 35 And all the residents of Lydda and Sharon saw him and turned to the Lord.
\v 36 In Joppa, there was a disciple named Tabitha, which translated means Dorcas; she was full of good works and acts of charity that she did.
\v 37 It came to pass in those days that she became ill and died; after washing her, they laid her in an upper chamber.
\v 38 As Peter was in Lydda near Joppa, the disciples, hearing that he was there, sent two men to him, urging him to delay no longer in coming to them.
\v 39 So Peter rose and went with them. When he arrived, they took him to the upstairs room. All the widows stood beside him, weeping and showing him the tunics and garments that Dorcas had made while she was with them.
\v 40 But Peter, having put them all outside, knelt down and prayed; and turning to the body, he said, 'Tabitha, arise.' And she opened her eyes, and when she saw Peter, she sat up.
\v 41 And giving her his hand, he raised her up; and calling the saints and the widows, he presented her alive.
\v 42 And this became known throughout all of Joppa, and many believed in the Lord.
\v 43 So it was that he stayed many days in Joppa with a certain Simon, a tanner.
\c 10
\p
\v 1 Now there was a certain man in Caesarea named Cornelius, a centurion of what was known as the Italian Regiment.
\v 2 He was a devout man and one who feared God with all his household; he gave many alms to the people and prayed to God always.
\v 3 About the ninth hour of the day, he distinctly saw in a vision an angel of God coming in and saying to him, 'Cornelius!'
\v 4 But when he gazed at him and became frightened, he said, 'What is it, Lord?' And the angel said to him, 'Your prayers and your acts of charity have ascended as a memorial before God.'
\v 5 And now, send men to Joppa to bring Simon, who is called Peter.
\v 6 He is lodging with Simon, a tanner, whose house is by the sea.
\v 7 When the angel who spoke to Cornelius had departed, he called two of his servants and a devout soldier from among those who attended him.
\v 8 After explaining everything to them, he sent them to Joppa.
\v 9 The next day, as they were on their journey and approaching the city, Peter went up on the roof to pray at about the sixth hour.
\v 10 And he became very hungry and wanted to eat; but while they were preparing the meal, a trance fell upon him.
\v 11 He saw heaven opened, and something like a great sheet descending, being let down to the earth by its four corners.
\v 12 In it were all kinds of four-footed animals of the earth, wild beasts, creeping things, and birds of the air.
\v 13 And a voice came to him, saying, ‘Get up, Peter, slay and eat.’
\v 14 But Peter said, 'No, Lord; for I have never eaten anything that is common or unclean.'
\v 15 And the voice spoke to him again a second time: 'What God has made clean, do not you call common.'
\v 16 This happened three times, and then the vessel was lifted up into heaven again.
\v 17 Now while Peter was perplexed within himself about what the vision he had seen might mean, behold, the men sent from Cornelius had made inquiry for Simon's house and stood at the gate.
\v 18 And when they called out, they were asking whether Simon, who is called Peter, was staying here.
\v 19 While Peter was pondering the vision, the Spirit said to him, 'Behold, three men are seeking you.'
\v 20 But arise and go down, and accompany them without hesitation, for I have sent them.
\v 21 And descending, Peter said to the men, 'Behold, I am the one you seek. What is the reason for your coming?'
\v 22 And they said, 'Cornelius, a centurion, a righteous man and one who fears God, well spoken of by the whole Jewish nation, was directed by a holy angel to send for you to his house and to hear words from you.'
\v 23 So he invited them in and offered them lodging. The next day he rose and went away with them, and some of the brothers from Joppa accompanied him.
\v 24 And the following day they entered into Caesarea. Cornelius was expecting them and had called together his relatives and close friends.
\v 25 As Peter entered, Cornelius met him, fell down at his feet, and worshiped.
\v 26 But Peter lifted him up, saying, 'Stand up; I too am just a man.'
\v 27 As he talked with him, he entered and found many gathered together.
\v 28 And he said to them, ‘You know how it is unlawful for a Jew to associate with or visit a Gentile; but God has shown me that I should not call any man common or unclean.’
\v 29 So I came without objection when I was sent for. I ask you, therefore, what reason did you send for me?
\v 30 And Cornelius said, ‘Four days ago to this very hour, I was fasting until now; and at the ninth hour, I was praying in my house; and behold, a man stood before me in bright clothing.’
\v 31 And he said, ‘Cornelius, your prayer has been heard, and your acts of charity have been remembered before God.’
\v 32 Send therefore to Joppa and summon Simon, who is called Peter. He is staying in the house of Simon, a tanner, by the sea; when he comes, he will speak to you.
\v 33 So I sent for you immediately, and you have done well to come. Now, we are all here in the presence of God to hear everything that you have been commanded by the Lord.
\v 34 Then Peter opened his mouth and said: "In truth, I perceive that God shows no partiality."
\v 35 But in every nation, he who fears Him and works righteousness is accepted by Him.
\v 36 The message He sent to the children of Israel proclaiming peace through Jesus Christ—He is Lord of all.
\v 37 You yourselves know what happened throughout all Judea, beginning from Galilee after the baptism that John proclaimed.
\v 38 Jesus of Nazareth, how God anointed him with the Holy Spirit and with power. He went about doing good and healing all who were oppressed by the devil, for God was with him.
\v 39 And we are witnesses of all that he did in the land of the Jews and in Jerusalem; they also killed him by hanging him on a tree.
\v 40 This is the one whom God raised up on the third day and made Him to be visibly present.
\v 41 not to all the people, but to witnesses whom God had previously chosen, to us who ate and drank with Him after He rose from the dead.
\v 42 And He commanded us to proclaim to the people and to testify that He is the one appointed by God to be the Judge of the living and the dead.
\v 43 To Him all the prophets bear witness, that through His name whoever believes in Him will receive forgiveness of sins.
\v 44 While Peter was still speaking these words, the Holy Spirit fell upon all who were listening to the message.
\v 45 And those of the circumcision who had come with Peter were astonished that the gift of the Holy Spirit was also poured out on the Gentiles.
\v 46 For they were hearing them speaking in tongues and magnifying God.
\v 47 Then Peter responded, "Can anyone withhold water for baptizing these people, who have received the Holy Spirit just as we have?"
\v 48 He commanded them to be baptized in the name of the Lord. Then they asked him to remain for a few days.
\c 11
\p
\v 1 Now the apostles and the brethren who were throughout Judea heard that even the Gentiles had received the word of God.
\v 2 And when Peter went up to Jerusalem, those of the circumcision contended with him.
\v 3 saying, 'You went in to uncircumcised men and ate with them.'
\v 4 But Peter began and explained to them in order, saying,
\v 5 I was in the city of Joppa praying, and in a trance I saw a vision, something like a great sheet descending, let down from heaven by four corners, and it came down to me.
\v 6 When I looked closely, I saw four-footed animals of the earth, wild beasts, creeping things, and birds of the air.
\v 7 I heard a voice saying to me, 'Rise, Peter; kill and eat.'
\v 8 But I said, 'By no means, Lord; for nothing common or unclean has ever entered my mouth.'
\v 9 But the voice answered me again from heaven, ‘What God has made clean, you must not call common.’
\v 10 This happened three times, and all was drawn up again into heaven.
\v 11 And behold, at that very moment, three men stood before the house in which I was, sent from Caesarea to me.
\v 12 And the Spirit said to me to go with them, doubting nothing. Moreover, these six brethren accompanied me, and we entered the house of the man.
\v 13 He reported to us how he had seen the angel standing in his house and saying to him, 'Send men to Joppa and summon Simon, who is called Peter.'
\v 14 He will speak words to you by which you will be saved, you and all your household.
\v 15 As I began to speak, the Holy Spirit fell upon them just as he did upon us at the beginning.
\v 16 Then I remembered the word of the Lord, how He said, 'John indeed baptized with water, but you shall be baptized with the Holy Spirit.'
\v 17 If therefore God gave them the same gift as He gave us when we believed on the Lord Jesus Christ, who was I to stand in God's way?
\v 18 When they heard these things, they became silent and glorified God, saying, 'Then God has granted to the Gentiles repentance unto life also.'
\v 19 Now those who had been scattered because of the persecution that arose over Stephen traveled as far as Phoenicia, Cyprus, and Antioch, speaking the word to no one except Jews.
\v 20 But there were some men from Cyprus and Cyrene who, upon entering Antioch, spoke to the Hellenists, proclaiming the good news of the Lord Jesus.
\v 21 And the hand of the Lord was with them, and a great number who believed turned to the Lord.
\v 22 News about them reached the ears of the church in Jerusalem, and they sent Barnabas to go as far as Antioch.
\v 23 When he arrived and saw the grace of God, he was glad and encouraged them all to remain true to the Lord with all their hearts.
\v 24 For he was a good man, full of the Holy Spirit and of faith; and a large number of people were added to the Lord.
\v 25 Then Barnabas went to Tarsus to search for Saul, and when he found him, he brought him to Antioch.
\v 26 So it happened that they were assembled together for a whole year in the church, and they taught a large crowd; and it was in Antioch that the disciples were first called Christians.
\v 27 During those days, prophets came down from Jerusalem to Antioch.
\v 28 And one of them, named Agabus, stood up and indicated through the Spirit that a great famine was about to come upon the entire inhabited earth; this took place during the reign of Claudius Caesar.
\v 29 So the disciples, each according to his ability, determined to send relief to the brothers living in Judea.
\v 30 This they did, sending it to the elders by the hand of Barnabas and Saul.
\c 12
\p
\v 1 About that time, King Herod laid hands on some who belonged to the church, intending to harm them.
\v 2 He executed James the brother of John with the sword.
\v 3 And when he saw that it was pleasing to the Jews, he added to seize Peter also. Now it was during the days of Unleavened Bread.
\v 4 Whom he seized and put in prison, assigning four squads of soldiers to guard him, intending to bring him out to the people after the Passover.
\v 5 So Peter was kept in prison, but earnest prayer for him was made to God by the church.
\v 6 When Herod was about to bring him out, that very night Peter was sleeping between two soldiers, bound with two chains; and guards were before the door watching over the prison.
\v 7 And behold, an angel of the Lord stood beside him, and a light shone in the prison. Striking Peter on the side, he awoke him, saying, 'Quickly, arise!' And his chains fell off his hands.
\v 8 Then the angel said to him, 'Gird yourself and tie on your sandals.' And so he did. And the angel said to him, 'Wrap your cloak around you and follow me.'
\v 9 So Peter went out and followed him, not realizing that what was happening through the angel was true; he thought he was seeing a vision.
\v 10 They passed through the first and second guards and came to the iron gate that leads into the city. This gate opened for them of its own accord, and when they had gone out, they went down one street; and immediately the angel departed from them.
\v 11 And when Peter came to himself, he said, "Now I truly know that the Lord has sent His angel and has rescued me from the hand of Herod and from all the expectation of the Jewish people."
\v 12 When he realized this, he went to the house of Mary, the mother of John, whose surname was Mark, where many were gathered together and were praying.
\v 13 And when he knocked at the door of the gateway, a maidservant named Rhoda came to answer.
\v 14 Recognizing Peter's voice, she was so overwhelmed with joy that she did not open the gate; instead, she ran to announce that Peter was standing at the gate.
\v 15 They said to her, "You are out of your mind!" But she insisted that it was so. They replied, "It must be his angel."
\v 16 But Peter continued knocking. When they opened the door, they saw him and were astonished.
\v 17 But motioning to them with his hand to be silent, he described to them how the Lord had brought him out of the prison. And he said, "Go, tell James and the brothers about this." Then he departed and went to another place.
\v 18 Now when day had come, there was no small commotion among the soldiers over what had become of Peter.
\v 19 But Herod, after searching for him and not finding him, questioned the guards and ordered them to be executed. He then went down from Judea to Caesarea and stayed there.
\v 20 Now Herod was angry with the people of Tyre and Sidon; and they came to him with one accord, and having persuaded Blastus, the king's chamberlain, they asked for peace, because their country depended on the king's country for food.
\v 21 On a designated day, Herod, adorned in royal robes, took his seat on the platform and delivered an oration to the people.
\v 22 But the crowd shouted, 'It is the voice of a god, not of a man!'
\v 23 Immediately, an angel of the Lord struck him down, because he did not give glory to God. And he was eaten by worms and died.
\v 24 But the word of God continued to grow and flourish.
\v 25 Then Barnabas and Saul returned from Jerusalem after they had completed their service, bringing with them John, who was called Mark.
\c 13
\p
\v 1 Now there were in the church at Antioch prophets and teachers: Barnabas, Simeon who was called Niger, Lucius of Cyrene, Manaen a lifelong friend of Herod the tetrarch, and Saul.
\v 2 While they were worshiping the Lord and fasting, the Holy Spirit said, 'Set apart for me Barnabas and Saul for the work to which I have called them.'
\v 3 Then, after fasting and praying, they laid their hands on them and sent them away.
\v 4 So, being sent out by the Holy Spirit, they went down to Seleucia, and from there they sailed to Cyprus.
\v 5 When they arrived at Salamis, they proclaimed the word of God in the synagogues of the Jews. They also had John as their assistant.
\v 6 And when they had traversed the island as far as Paphos, they found a certain magician, a false prophet, a Jew whose name was Bar-Jesus.
\v 7 Who was with the proconsul, Sergius Paulus, an intelligent man. This man summoned Barnabas and Saul and sought to hear the word of God.
\v 8 But Elymas the sorcerer opposed them, for that is the translation of his name, seeking to distort the proconsul from the faith.
\v 9 But Saul, who is also called Paul, filled with the Holy Spirit, looked intently at him.
\v 10 He said, "O full of all deceit and every villainy, you son of the devil, enemy of all righteousness, will you not cease making crooked the straight paths of the Lord?
\v 11 And now, behold, the hand of the Lord is upon you, and you will be blind, unable to see the sun for a season. Immediately, mist and darkness fell upon him, and he went about seeking someone to lead him by the hand.
\v 12 Then the proconsul, when he saw what had happened, believed, being astonished at the teaching of the Lord.
\v 13 Now Paul and his companions set sail from Paphos and came to Perga in Pamphylia; but John departed from them and returned to Jerusalem.
\v 14 But passing through Perga, they arrived at Antioch in Pisidia; and entering the synagogue on the Sabbath day, they sat down.
\v 15 After the reading of the Law and the Prophets, the rulers of the synagogue sent word to them, saying, 'Men, brothers, if you have any word of encouragement for the people, speak.'
\v 16 Standing up, Paul motioned with his hand and said: 'Men of Israel and you who fear God, listen carefully.
\v 17 The God of this people, Israel, chose our ancestors, and He elevated the people during their sojourn in the land of Egypt, and with a mighty arm, He brought them out from there.
\v 18 And for about forty years He sustained them in the wilderness.
\v 19 And after destroying seven nations in the land of Canaan, He distributed their land to them as an inheritance.
\v 20 And after that, for four hundred and fifty years, He gave them judges until Samuel the prophet.
\v 21 Then they asked for a king, and God gave them Saul the son of Kish, a man from the tribe of Benjamin, for forty years.
\v 22 And when He had removed him, He raised up David to be their king, of whom He testified, saying, 'I have found David, the son of Jesse, a man after my own heart, who will fulfill all my purposes.'
\v 23 From this man's descendants, God has brought to Israel a Savior, Jesus, as He promised.
\v 24 Before His coming, John preached a baptism of repentance to all the people of Israel.
\v 25 As John was completing his course, he said, ‘Who do you suppose I am? I am not the one you are looking for; but there comes one after me, whose sandals I am not fit to untie.'
\v 26 Men, brothers, sons of the family of Abraham, and you who fear God among us, to you the message of this salvation has been sent.
\v 27 For those who dwell in Jerusalem and their rulers, not recognizing him, fulfilled the words of the prophets that are read every Sabbath.
\v 28 And though they found no valid reason for His death, they requested Pilate to have Him executed.
\v 29 And when they had fulfilled all that was written concerning Him, they took Him down from the tree and laid Him in a tomb.
\v 30 But God raised Him from the dead.
\v 31 He was seen for many days by those who came up with Him from Galilee to Jerusalem, who are now His witnesses to the people.
\v 32 And we declare to you the good news of the promise made to the fathers, that this promise God has fulfilled to us their children by raising up Jesus.
\v 33 As it is written in the second Psalm, 'You are my Son; today I have begotten you.'
\v 34 And as for His raising Him from the dead, never again to return to decay, He has spoken in this way: 'I will give you the holy and faithful promises made to David.'
\v 35 Therefore, He also says in another psalm, 'You will not allow Your Holy One to see corruption.'
\v 36 For David, after he had served his own generation by the purpose of God, fell asleep; and he was buried with his fathers, and saw decay.
\v 37 But the One whom God raised did not experience decay.
\v 38 Let it be known to you, brothers, that through Him forgiveness of sins is proclaimed to you.
\v 39 And from all the things from which you could not be justified by the Law of Moses, in this, everyone who believes is justified.
\v 40 Therefore, take heed, lest what is said in the prophets come upon you:
\v 41 ‘Behold, you despisers, and marvel, and perish! For I am doing a work in your days, a work which you will not believe, though it were told to you.’
\v 42 As they were leaving the synagogue, the people invited them to speak further about these things on the next Sabbath.
\v 43 When the synagogue was dismissed, many of the Jews and devout converts to Judaism followed Paul and Barnabas, who spoke to them and urged them to continue in the grace of God.
\v 44 On the next Sabbath, nearly the whole city came together to hear the word of God.
\v 45 But when the Jews saw the crowds, they were filled with jealousy and began to contradict what was spoken by Paul, vehemently opposing and slandering him.
\v 46 Then Paul and Barnabas boldly declared, 'It was necessary that the word of God be spoken first to you. But since you reject it and judge yourselves unworthy of eternal life, behold, we turn to the Gentiles.'
\v 47 For so the Lord has commanded us: 'I have made you a light for the Gentiles, that you may bring salvation to the ends of the earth.'
\v 48 And when the Gentiles heard this, they rejoiced and accepted the word of the Lord, and as many as were appointed to eternal life believed.
\v 49 And the word of the Lord spread throughout the entire region.
\v 50 But the Jews stirred up the devout women of high standing and the leading men of the city, and incited a persecution against Paul and Barnabas, and drove them out of their district.
\v 51 But shaking off the dust from their feet against them, they went on to Iconium.
\v 52 And the disciples were filled with joy and the Holy Spirit.
\c 14
\p
\v 1 In Iconium, Paul and Barnabas entered together into the Jewish synagogue and spoke in such a way that a great multitude of both Jews and Greeks believed.
\v 2 But the unbelieving Jews stirred up and poisoned the minds of the Gentiles against the brothers.
\v 3 Therefore, they spent a considerable amount of time speaking boldly for the Lord, who bore witness to the word of His grace, granting signs and wonders to be performed by their hands.
\v 4 But the city’s populace was divided; some were aligned with the Jews, while others sided with the apostles.
\v 5 When an assault was made by both the Gentiles and the Jews, along with their rulers, to mistreat and stone them,
\v 6 Aware of the plot against them, they fled to the cities of Lycaonia, Lystra, and Derbe, and the surrounding region.
\v 7 And there they were proclaiming the good news.
\v 8 And in Lystra, a certain man sat who was unable to walk, crippled from his mother’s womb, who had never walked.
\v 9 This man heard Paul speaking. Paul, observing him intently and seeing that he had faith to be healed,
\v 10 He said with a loud voice, ‘Stand upright on your feet!’ And he leaped up and began to walk.
\v 11 But when the crowds saw what Paul had done, they raised their voices, saying in Lycaonian, 'The gods have come down to us in the likeness of men!'
\v 12 And they called Barnabas Zeus, and Paul they called Hermes, because he was the chief speaker.
\v 13 But the priest of Zeus, whose temple was just outside their city, brought bulls and wreaths to the gates, intending with the crowds to offer a sacrifice.
\v 14 But when the apostles Barnabas and Paul heard of it, they tore their clothes and rushed into the crowd, crying out,
\v 15 Men, why are you doing these things? We are also men, just like you, and we bring you good news, turning you from these worthless things to the living God, who made the heaven and the earth and the sea and everything in them.
\v 16 In past generations, He allowed all nations to go their own ways.
\v 17 Yet He did not leave Himself without witness, for He did good by giving you rains from heaven and fruitful seasons, filling your hearts with food and gladness.
\v 18 Even saying these things, they barely restrained the crowds from offering sacrifices to them.
\v 19 But Jews came from Antioch and Iconium, and having persuaded the crowds, they stoned Paul and dragged him out of the city, supposing that he was dead.
\v 20 But when the disciples gathered around him, he rose up and entered the city; and the next day he went out with Barnabas to Derbe.
\v 21 After preaching the gospel in that city and winning many to faith, they returned to Lystra, Iconium, and Antioch.
\v 22 Strengthening the souls of the disciples, encouraging them to continue in the faith, and saying that through many tribulations it is necessary for us to enter the kingdom of God.
\v 23 And when they had appointed elders for them in every church, and had prayed with fasting, they commended them to the Lord in whom they had believed.
\v 24 And after traversing Pisidia, they arrived in Pamphylia.
\v 25 And after speaking the word in Perga, they descended to Attalia.
\v 26 From there they sailed to Antioch, where they had been entrusted to the grace of God for the work they had fulfilled.
\v 27 Upon their arrival, they gathered the church together and reported all that God had accomplished through them, and how He had opened the door of faith to the Gentiles.
\v 28 So they remained there for a considerable time with the disciples.
\c 15
\p
\v 1 And certain men came down from Judea and taught the brethren, saying, "Unless you are circumcised according to the custom of Moses, you cannot be saved."
\v 2 And when there arose no small contention and inquiry by Paul and Barnabas with them, they appointed Paul and Barnabas and some others from among them to go up to the apostles and elders in Jerusalem concerning this issue.
\v 3 So, being sent on their way by the church, they traveled through Phoenicia and Samaria, reporting the conversion of the Gentiles, and bringing great joy to all the brethren.
\v 4 When they arrived in Jerusalem, they were welcomed by the church and the apostles and the elders, and they reported all that God had done with them, including how He had opened the door of faith to the Gentiles.
\v 5 But some of the believers who belonged to the sect of the Pharisees rose up and said, 'It is necessary to circumcise them and to command them to keep the Law of Moses.'
\v 6 The apostles and the elders were gathered together to consider this matter.
\v 7 And after much discussion, Peter rose and said to them, 'Men, brethren, you know that from ancient days, God chose through my mouth to make the Gentiles hear the word of the Gospel and to believe.'
\v 8 And God, who knows the heart, testified to them by giving them the Holy Spirit, just as He did to us.
\v 9 And He made no distinction between us and them, cleansing their hearts by faith.
\v 10 Now therefore, why do you test God by placing a yoke upon the neck of the disciples, which neither our fathers nor we were able to bear?
\v 11 But we believe that through the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ we shall be saved in the same manner as they.
\v 12 Then all the multitude fell silent and listened as Barnabas and Paul related all the things God had done among the Gentiles through them.
\v 13 After they had fallen silent, James replied, "Men, brothers, listen to me."
\v 14 Simeon has explained how God first visited the Gentiles to take from them a people for His name.
\v 15 And the words of the prophets agree with this, as it is written:
\v 16 After this, I will return and rebuild the fallen tent of David; I will rebuild its ruins and restore it.
\v 17 so that the remnant of mankind may seek the Lord, and all the nations upon whom My name has been called, says the Lord who does all these things.
\v 18 Known to God from eternity are all His works.
\v 19 Therefore, I judge that we should not trouble those from among the Gentiles who are turning to God.
\v 20 But we should instruct them to refrain from things polluted by idols, from sexual immorality, from what is strangled, and from blood.
\v 21 For Moses has been preached in every city from ancient generations, and he is read aloud in the synagogues every Sabbath.
\v 22 Then it seemed good to the apostles and the elders, with the whole church, to choose men from among them and send them to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas: Judas, who was called Barsabbas, and Silas, leading men among the brethren.
\v 23 They wrote this letter by their hand: The apostles and the elders, and the brothers, to the brothers of the Gentiles in Antioch, Syria, and Cilicia, greetings.
\v 24 Since we have heard that some of our number have troubled you with words, unsettling your souls, saying you must be circumcised and observe the law, to which we gave no such instruction,
\v 25 It seemed good to us, having come together in unity, to choose men to send to you along with our beloved Barnabas and Paul.
\v 26 men who have risked their lives for the sake of our Lord Jesus Christ.
\v 27 Therefore, we have sent Judas and Silas, who will also report the same things by word of mouth.
\v 28 For it has seemed good to the Holy Spirit and to us to impose on you no greater burden than these essential things.
\v 29 You are to abstain from food offered to idols, from consuming blood, from anything that has been strangled, and from sexual immorality. If you keep yourselves from these things, you will do well. Farewell.
\v 30 So when they were sent off, they went down to Antioch, where they gathered the congregation together and delivered the letter.
\v 31 When they read it, they rejoiced at the encouragement it brought.
\v 32 Judas and Silas, who themselves were prophets, encouraged the brothers with many words and strengthened them.
\v 33 After some time had passed, they were sent away in peace by the brothers to return to the apostles.
\v 34 But it seemed good to Silas to remain there.
\v 35 But Paul and Barnabas stayed in Antioch, teaching and proclaiming the word of the Lord, along with many others.
\v 36 After some days, Paul said to Barnabas, 'Let us return and visit our brothers in every city where we proclaimed the word of the Lord, to see how they are doing.'
\v 37 But Barnabas resolved to take along John, called Mark.
\v 38 But Paul considered it serious that the one who had deserted them in Pamphylia and had not continued with them in the work should not be taken along.
\v 39 As a result, a sharp disagreement arose, so that they parted ways. Barnabas took Mark and sailed away to Cyprus.
\v 40 But Paul chose Silas and departed, commended to the grace of God by the brothers.
\v 41 And he traveled through Syria and Cilicia, strengthening the churches.
\c 16
\p
\v 1 Then he arrived at Derbe and Lystra. Behold, there was a disciple there named Timothy, the son of a certain Jewish woman who was a believer, but his father was a Greek.
\v 2 He was well spoken of by the brothers in Lystra and Iconium.
\v 3 Paul wanted to take him along on the journey, so he circumcised him because of the Jews who lived in that area; for they all knew that his father was a Greek.
\v 4 As they traveled through the cities, they delivered to them the decrees that had been decided upon by the apostles and the elders in Jerusalem, to be observed.
\v 5 So the churches were strengthened in their faith and grew in number day by day.
\v 6 Now they traveled through the region of Phrygia and Galatia, having been forbidden by the Holy Spirit to speak the word in Asia.
\v 7 When they had come to the region of Mysia, they attempted to go into Bithynia, but the Spirit did not permit them.
\v 8 So, passing by Mysia, they descended to Troas.
\v 9 And during the night, a vision appeared to Paul: A man of Macedonia stood and pleaded with him, saying, 'Come over to Macedonia and help us.'
\v 10 When he had seen the vision, we immediately sought to go into Macedonia, concluding that God had called us to preach the Gospel to them.
\v 11 Setting sail from Troas, we made a straight course to Samothrace, and the next day to Neapolis.
\v 12 From there we went to Philippi, which is the foremost city of that part of Macedonia, a Roman colony. And we stayed in that city for some days.
\v 13 On the Sabbath day, we went outside the city gate to the riverside, where we expected to find a place of prayer, and sitting down, we spoke to the women who had gathered there.
\v 14 One particular woman named Lydia, a seller of purple goods from the city of Thyatira, who was a worshiper of God, was listening; the Lord opened her heart to pay attention to the things spoken by Paul.
\v 15 And after she was baptized, along with her household, she urged us, saying, "If you have judged me to be faithful to the Lord, come and stay at my house." And she insisted until we agreed.
\v 16 As we were going to prayer, a certain slave girl met us, who had a spirit of divination, and brought her masters much profit by fortune-telling.
\v 17 This girl followed Paul and Silas and cried out, saying, "These men are servants of the Most High God, who proclaim to us the way of salvation."
\v 18 This continued for many days. Paul, greatly annoyed, turned to the spirit and said, 'I command you in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her.' And it came out at that very hour.
\v 19 But when her owners saw that their hope of profit was gone, they seized Paul and Silas and dragged them into the marketplace before the rulers.
\v 20 And bringing them before the magistrates, they said, "These men, being Jews, are causing great disturbance in our city."
\v 21 and they proclaim customs that are not lawful for us to accept or practice, being Romans.
\v 22 And the crowd joined in attacking them, and the magistrates tore off their clothes and ordered them to be beaten with rods.
\v 23 After they had inflicted many blows upon them, they threw them into prison, ordering the jailer to keep them securely.
\v 24 Having received such an order, he put them into the innermost prison and fastened their feet in the stocks.
\v 25 But around midnight, Paul and Silas were praying and singing hymns to God, and the other prisoners were listening to them.
\v 26 But suddenly there was a great earthquake, so that the foundations of the prison were shaken; and immediately all the doors were opened and everyone's chains were unfastened.
\v 27 When the jailer woke up and saw the prison doors wide open, he drew his sword and was about to kill himself, thinking that the prisoners had escaped.
\v 28 But Paul called out with a loud voice, 'Do not harm yourself, for we are all here!'
\v 29 He called for lights, rushed in, and trembling with fear, he fell down before Paul and Silas.
\v 30 He brought them outside and asked, 'Sirs, what must I do to be saved?'
\v 31 They replied, 'Believe in the Lord Jesus Christ, and you will be saved—you and your household.'
\v 32 And they spoke to him the message of the Lord, along with all those in his household.
\v 33 And taking them at that very hour of the night, he washed their wounds, and he and all his household were baptized without delay.
\v 34 Then he brought them into his house and set a table before them, and he rejoiced greatly with his entire household, having believed in God.
\v 35 But when day had come, the magistrates sent the officers, saying, Release those men.
\v 36 The jailer reported these words to Paul, saying, 'The magistrates have sent to let you go. Now therefore, you may go out and depart in peace.'
\v 37 But Paul said to them, 'They have beaten us publicly, uncondemned men who are Roman citizens, and they have thrown us into prison; and now they secretly want to release us? No, indeed! Let them come themselves and bring us out.'
\v 38 So the jailers reported these words to the magistrates, and they were alarmed upon hearing that they were Roman citizens.
\v 39 And they came and encouraged them, and after bringing them out, they asked them to leave the city.
\v 40 After leaving the prison, they went to Lydia’s house; and when they saw the brothers, they encouraged them and then departed.
\c 17
\p
\v 1 Now when they had traveled through Amphipolis and Apollonia, they came to Thessalonica, where there was a synagogue of the Jews.
\v 2 As was his custom, Paul went in to them, and for three Sabbaths he reasoned with them from the Scriptures.
\v 3 explaining and proving that it was necessary for the Christ to suffer and to rise from the dead, and saying, 'This Jesus whom I proclaim to you is the Christ.'
\v 4 And some of them were persuaded and joined Paul and Silas, along with a great multitude of the devout Greeks, and not a few leading women.
\v 5 But the unbelieving Jews took some wicked men from the marketplace, formed a mob, and stirred up the city, attacking the house of Jason; they sought to bring them out to the assembly.
\v 6 But when they could not find them, they dragged Jason and some of the brothers before the city rulers, shouting, 'These men who have turned the world upside down have come here also.'
\v 7 whom Jason has received; and these men are all acting contrary to the decrees of Caesar, saying there is another king, Jesus.
\v 8 And they stirred up the crowd and the city officials who heard these things.
\v 9 And when they had taken sufficient security from Jason and the others, they released them.
\v 10 The brethren immediately sent Paul and Silas away by night to Berea; and when they arrived, they went into the Jewish synagogue.
\v 11 These were more noble-minded than those in Thessalonica, for they received the word with all readiness of mind and searched the Scriptures daily to see whether these things were so.
\v 12 Therefore, many of them believed, as did a number of prominent Greek women and men.
\v 13 But when the Jews from Thessalonica learned that the word of God was proclaimed by Paul in Berea also, they came there too, agitating and disturbing the crowds.
\v 14 Immediately then, the brothers sent Paul away to go as far as the sea; but Silas and Timothy remained there.
\v 15 The men who accompanied Paul brought him to Athens; and having received a command for Silas and Timothy to join him as quickly as possible, they departed.
\v 16 While Paul was waiting for them in Athens, his spirit was provoked within him as he observed the city full of idols.
\v 17 So he reasoned in the synagogue with the Jews and those who worshipped God, and in the marketplace every day with those who happened to be there.
\v 18 Some of the Epicurean and Stoic philosophers encountered him, and some said, 'What does this seed picker want to say?' Others said, 'He seems to be a proclaimer of foreign deities,' because he was preaching Jesus and the resurrection to them.
\v 19 And taking hold of him, they brought him to the Areopagus, saying, 'May we know what this new teaching is that you are proclaiming?'
\v 20 For you bring some strange things to our ears; therefore we wish to know what these things could mean.
\v 21 Now all the Athenians and the foreigners residing there spent their time in nothing but telling or hearing something new.
\v 22 Standing in the midst of the Areopagus, Paul said: "Men of Athens, I perceive that in every way you are very superstitious."
\v 23 For as I walked around and examined your objects of worship, I even found an altar with this inscription: 'To an Unknown God.' Therefore, what you worship as unknown, this I proclaim to you.
\v 24 The God who made the world and everything in it, being Lord of heaven and earth, does not dwell in temples made by human hands.
\v 25 Nor is He served by human hands, as if He needed anything, since He Himself gives to all life and breath and everything else.
\v 26 And He made from one blood every nation of men to dwell on all the face of the earth, having determined their appointed times and the boundaries of their dwelling places.
\v 27 that they might seek God, if perhaps they might grope for Him and find Him, though He is not far from each one of us.
\v 28 For in Him we live and move and have our being; as even some of your own poets have said, 'For we are also His offspring.'
\v 29 Being therefore the offspring of God, we ought not to think that the divine nature is like gold or silver or stone, shaped by human art and imagination.
\v 30 Therefore, having overlooked the times of ignorance, God now commands all people everywhere to repent.
\v 31 For He has set a day on which He will judge the world in righteousness by the man whom He has appointed. He has given assurance to all by raising Him from the dead.
\v 32 Now when they heard about the resurrection of the dead, some mocked, while others said, 'We want to hear you again on this matter.'
\v 33 And so, Paul went out from their midst.
\v 34 Yet some men joined him and believed, among whom were Dionysius the Areopagite, a woman named Damaris, and others with them.
\c 18
\p
\v 1 After these events, Paul departed from Athens and came to Corinth.
\v 2 And having found a certain Jew named Aquila, a native of Pontus, recently come from Italy with his wife Priscilla, because Claudius had commanded all the Jews to depart from Rome, he went to them.
\v 3 And because they shared the same trade, he stayed with them and worked; for they were tentmakers by trade.
\v 4 And he reasoned in the synagogue every Sabbath, and persuaded both Jews and Greeks.
\v 5 But when Silas and Timothy came down from Macedonia, Paul was compelled by the Spirit and testified to the Jews that Jesus is the Christ.
\v 6 But when they opposed and blasphemed him, he shook out his garments and said to them, "Your blood be upon your own heads; I am innocent. From now on I will go to the Gentiles."
\v 7 And after leaving there, he came to the house of a certain man named Justus, a God-fearing man, whose house was next to the synagogue.
\v 8 Crispus, the leader of the synagogue, believed in the Lord along with his whole household. Many of the Corinthians who heard Paul believed and were baptized.
\v 9 But the Lord said to Paul in a vision at night, 'Do not be afraid, but speak and do not be silent.'
\v 10 For I am with you, and no one will attack you to harm you, for I have many people in this city.
\v 11 And he remained there for a year and six months, teaching the word of God among them.
\v 12 But while Gallio was proconsul of Achaia, the Jews made a united attack against Paul and brought him before the judgment seat.
\v 13 saying, "This man is persuading people to worship God contrary to the law."
\v 14 But just as Paul was about to open his mouth, Gallio said to the Jews, 'If it were a matter of wrongdoing or a wicked crime, O Jews, I would have reason to listen to you.'
\v 15 But if it is a matter concerning words, names, and your law, you yourselves shall judge; for I do not wish to be a judge of these matters.
\v 16 And he drove them away from the judgment seat.
\v 17 Then all the Greeks seized Sosthenes, the chief ruler of the synagogue, and beat him before the judgment seat; and Gallio took no notice of these things.
\v 18 So Paul, having stayed many days longer, said farewell to the brothers and sailed away to Syria, and with him were Priscilla and Aquila, having shorn his head in Cenchreae; for he had taken a vow.
\v 19 He arrived in Ephesus, and he left them there; but he himself entered the synagogue and engaged in discussion with the Jews.
\v 20 When they asked him to stay longer with them, he did not consent.
\v 21 But he took leave of them, saying, 'I must by all means celebrate the upcoming feast in Jerusalem; and I will return to you again if God wills.' And he set sail from Ephesus.
\v 22 And when he had come down to Caesarea, he went up and greeted the church; then he went down to Antioch.
\v 23 After spending some time there, he departed and went through the Galatian region and Phrygia, strengthening all the disciples.
\v 24 Now a certain Jew named Apollos, born in Alexandria, an eloquent man, came to Ephesus; he was mighty in the Scriptures.
\v 25 He was well-instructed in the way of the Lord, and being fervent in spirit, he spoke and taught accurately the things concerning the Lord, knowing only the baptism of John.
\v 26 He began to speak boldly in the synagogue; but when Aquila and Priscilla heard him, they took him aside and explained to him the way of God more accurately.
\v 27 And when he intended to go to Achaia, the brothers encouraged him and wrote to the disciples to welcome him; and upon his arrival, he greatly helped those who had believed through grace.
\v 28 For he powerfully refuted the Jews in public debate, demonstrating through the Scriptures that Jesus was the Christ.
\c 19
\p
\v 1 While Apollos was at Corinth, Paul passed through the upper regions and came to Ephesus. There he found some disciples.
\v 2 He asked them, "Did you receive the Holy Spirit when you believed?" They replied, "No, we have not even heard that there is a Holy Spirit."
\v 3 He asked them, "Into what then were you baptized?" And they said, "Into John’s baptism."
\v 4 Then Paul said, "John indeed baptized with a baptism of repentance, telling the people to believe in the One who would come after him, that is, in Christ Jesus."
\v 5 Upon hearing this, they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.
\v 6 And when Paul had laid his hands upon them, the Holy Spirit came upon them, and they began to speak in tongues and prophesy.
\v 7 There were about twelve men in all.
\v 8 And he entered the synagogue and spoke boldly for three months, reasoning and persuading concerning the kingdom of God.
\v 9 But when some became hardened and disobedient, speaking evil of the Way before the multitude, he departed from them and separated the disciples, reasoning daily in the school of Tyrannus.
\v 10 This continued for two years, so that all who lived in Asia heard the word of the Lord Jesus, both Jews and Greeks.
\v 11 And God was performing extraordinary miracles by the hands of Paul.
\v 12 So that even handkerchiefs or aprons that had touched his skin were carried away to the sick, and diseases left them, and evil spirits came out of them.
\v 13 But some of the itinerant Jewish exorcists undertook to invoke the name of the Lord Jesus over those who had evil spirits, saying, 'I adjure you by Jesus whom Paul proclaims.'
\v 14 And there were seven sons of Sceva, a Jewish chief priest, who were doing this.
\v 15 But the evil spirit answered and said, 'Jesus I know, and Paul I am acquainted with; but who are you?'
\v 16 And the man in whom the evil spirit was came upon them, overpowered them, and prevailed against them, so that they fled out of that house naked and wounded.
\v 17 This became known to all the Jews and Greeks living in Ephesus, and fear fell upon them all, and the name of the Lord Jesus was magnified.
\v 18 Many of those who had believed came forward, confessing and declaring their deeds.
\v 19 And many of those who practiced curious arts brought their books together and burned them in the sight of all; and they counted the prices of them and found it to be fifty thousand pieces of silver.
\v 20 Thus, the word of the Lord grew mightily and prevailed.
\v 21 After these events had taken place, Paul felt compelled in the Spirit to go through Macedonia and Achaia and then proceed to Jerusalem, declaring that after I have been there, it is necessary for me to see Rome as well.
\v 22 He sent two of his companions, Timothy and Erastus, to Macedonia, while he himself remained for a time longer in Asia.
\v 23 And at that time, there arose no small commotion concerning the way.
\v 24 For a certain man named Demetrius, a silversmith, who made silver shrines of Artemis, brought no little gain to the craftsmen.
\v 25 Gathering them together, he said, "Men, you know that our prosperity comes from this trade.
\v 26 And you see and hear that not only in Ephesus, but almost throughout all of Asia, this Paul has persuaded and turned away a considerable number of people, saying that they are not gods which are made by hands.
\v 27 Not only is there a risk that our business may fall into disrepute, but also that the temple of the great goddess Artemis will be regarded as nothing, and that she, whom all of Asia and the world worship, will be brought to nothing.
\v 28 When they heard this and became filled with rage, they began shouting, "Great is Artemis of the Ephesians!"
\v 29 And the whole city was filled with confusion; and they rushed together into the theater, dragging along Gaius and Aristarchus, Macedonians who were companions of Paul.
\v 30 But when Paul wanted to enter the assembly, the disciples would not let him.
\v 31 Yet some of the Asiarchs, who were his friends, sent to him and urged him not to venture into the theater.
\v 32 So then, some were shouting one thing and others were shouting another, for the assembly was in confusion, and the majority did not know why they had come together.
\v 33 From the crowd, they pushed forward Alexander, whom the Jews had put forward; and Alexander, waving his hand, wanted to make a defense to the people.
\v 34 But when they recognized that he was a Jew, a single outcry arose from them all, as they shouted for about two hours, "Great is Artemis of the Ephesians!"
\v 35 But when the town clerk had quieted the crowd, he said: 'Men of Ephesus, what person is there who does not know that the city of the Ephesians is the keeper of the temple of the great goddess Artemis and of the image that fell from Zeus?'
\v 36 Therefore, since these things are indisputable, it is necessary for you to remain calm and not act hastily.
\v 37 For you have brought these men here who are neither sacrilegious nor are they blaspheming your goddess.
\v 38 So if Demetrius and the craftsmen who are with him have a complaint against anyone, the courts are open and there are proconsuls; let them bring charges against one another.
\v 39 But if you seek anything further, it shall be resolved in the lawful assembly.
\v 40 For we are in danger of being charged with a riot today, since there is no legitimate reason for this commotion we are unable to justify.
\c 20
\p
\v 1 After the uproar had ceased, Paul called the disciples to himself and, after encouraging them, took his leave to go to Macedonia.
\v 2 When he had gone through those regions and had given them much encouragement, he came to Greece.
\v 3 After spending three months there, and facing a plot against him by the Jews as he was about to sail to Syria, he decided to return through Macedonia.
\v 4 He was accompanied by Sopater, a Berean; Aristarchus and Secundus from Thessalonica; Gaius from Derbe; Timothy; and the Asians, Tychicus and Trophimus.
\v 5 These men went on ahead and waited for us at Troas.
\v 6 But we sailed away from Philippi after the days of Unleavened Bread, and came to them at Troas within five days, where we stayed for seven days.
\v 7 On the first day of the week, when we gathered together to break bread, Paul spoke to them, intending to depart the next day, and he prolonged his message until midnight.
\v 8 And there were many lamps in the upper room where we were gathered together.
\v 9 And a certain young man named Eutychus, sitting in a window, fell into a deep sleep as Paul spoke on and on. Being overcome by sleep, he fell down from the third story and was picked up dead.
\v 10 But Paul went down, fell upon him, and embracing him said, "Do not be troubled, for his life is still in him."
\v 11 Then Paul went back upstairs, broke bread, and shared a meal with them. He spoke with them for a considerable time, until daylight, and then departed.
\v 12 They brought the boy alive, and they were greatly comforted.
\v 13 We, however, went ahead to the ship and set sail for Assos, intending to take Paul on board there; for so he had arranged, since he was going there on foot.
\v 14 When he joined us at Assos, we took him on board and sailed on to Mytilene.
\v 15 From there, we set sail, and the following day we arrived opposite Chios; we then sailed past Chios and landed at Samos, and after staying at Trogyllium, we came to Miletus.
\v 16 For Paul had decided to sail past Ephesus, so that he would not spend time in Asia; for he was hurrying to be in Jerusalem, if possible, by the day of Pentecost.
\v 17 From Miletus, he sent to Ephesus and called for the elders of the church.
\v 18 And when they came to him, he said to them, 'You yourselves know how from the very first day I set foot in Asia, I was with you at all times.'
\v 19 Serving the Lord with complete humility and with tears, and enduring trials that came upon me from the plots of the Jews.
\v 20 How I did not hold back from proclaiming to you anything that was beneficial, nor did I cease to teach you publicly and from house to house.
\v 21 Testifying both to Jews and to Greeks of repentance toward God and of faith in our Lord Jesus Christ.
\v 22 And now, behold, I am compelled by the Spirit to go to Jerusalem, not knowing what will happen to me there.
\v 23 However, I know that the Holy Spirit testifies to me in every city that chains and tribulations await me.
\v 24 But I do not consider my life worth anything to me; my only aim is to finish the race and complete the ministry I received from the Lord Jesus, the task of testifying to the gospel of God’s grace.
\v 25 And now, behold, I know that you will no longer see my face, all of you among whom I have gone about proclaiming the kingdom of God.
\v 26 Therefore, I testify to you today that I am innocent of the blood of all men.
\v 27 For I did not shrink from declaring to you the entire will of God.
\v 28 Take heed to yourselves and to all the flock, in which the Holy Spirit has made you overseers, to shepherd the church of the Lord and God, which He purchased with His own blood.
\v 29 For I know this: that after my departure, fierce wolves will come in among you, not sparing the flock.
\v 30 And from among your own selves will arise men speaking twisted things, to draw away the disciples after them.
\v 31 Therefore, be on guard, remembering that for three years I did not cease, night and day, to admonish each one of you with tears.
\v 32 And now I commend you, brothers, to God and to the word of His grace, which is able to build you up and to give you an inheritance among all those who are sanctified.
\v 33 I have not coveted anyone's silver or gold or clothing.
\v 34 You yourselves know that these hands have provided for my own needs and for those who were with me.
\v 35 In everything I showed you that by working hard we must help the weak and remember the words of the Lord Jesus, for he himself said, 'It is more blessed to give than to receive.'
\v 36 And when he had said these things, he knelt down with all of them and prayed.
\v 37 And there was a great outpouring of tears from all, and they fell upon Paul’s neck and kissed him.
\v 38 They were especially grieved by the word he had spoken, that they would see his face no more. And they accompanied him to the ship.
\c 21
\p
\v 1 And when we had parted from them and set sail, we came straight to the island of Cos, and the next day to Rhodes, and from there to Patara.
\v 2 And finding a ship sailing to Phoenicia, we went aboard and set sail.
\v 3 After we had seen Cyprus and left it on our left, we sailed on to Syria, and landed at Tyre; for there the ship was unloading its cargo.
\v 4 Finding the disciples there, we stayed with them for seven days. They urged Paul through the Spirit not to go up to Jerusalem.
\v 5 But when our days there were ended, we departed, with all of them—including their wives and children—accompanying us until we were outside the city. After kneeling down on the shore, we prayed.
\v 6 And after greeting one another, we boarded the ship, while they returned to their own homes.
\v 7 But we had completed our voyage from Tyre and arrived at Ptolemais; and after greeting the brethren, we stayed with them for one day.
\v 8 The next day, we departed and came to Caesarea, and entering the house of Philip the evangelist, who was one of the seven, we remained with him.
\v 9 And he had four unmarried daughters who prophesied.
\v 10 While we were staying there for several days, a prophet named Agabus came down from Judea.
\v 11 And when he had come to us, he took Paul’s belt and bound his own feet and hands, saying, ‘Thus says the Holy Spirit: So shall the Jews at Jerusalem bind the man whose belt this is and deliver him into the hands of the Gentiles.’
\v 12 When we heard this, both we and the local disciples urged him not to go up to Jerusalem.
\v 13 Then Paul answered, "What are you doing, weeping and breaking my heart? For I am ready not only to be bound, but also to die in Jerusalem for the name of the Lord Jesus."
\v 14 And since he would not be persuaded, we ceased our urging, saying, 'Let the will of the Lord be done.'
\v 15 And after these days, we made preparations and ascended to Jerusalem.
\v 16 And some of the disciples from Caesarea also came with us, bringing us to a man named Mnason, a Cypriot of ancient standing, one of the early disciples.
\v 17 And when we arrived in Jerusalem, the brethren received us gladly.
\v 18 The following day, Paul went in with us to see James, and all the elders were present.
\v 19 And after greeting them, he reported in detail everything that God had done among the Gentiles through his ministry.
\v 20 And when they heard it, they glorified the Lord. And they said to him, "You see, brother, how many thousands there are among the Jews of those who have believed. They are all zealous for the Law."
\v 21 They have been informed about you, that you teach all the Jews among the Gentiles to abandon Moses, telling them not to circumcise their children or to walk according to the customs.
\v 22 What then must be done? A multitude must certainly come together, for they will hear that you have arrived.
\v 23 Therefore, do this that we tell you: We have four men here who have taken a vow upon themselves.
\v 24 Take these men, purify yourself along with them, and bear the cost for them to have their heads shaved, so that all may know that there is nothing in what they have been told about you, but that you yourself also live in observance of the Law.
\v 25 As for the believers from the Gentiles, we have sent them our decision that they should abstain from the pollutions of idols, from blood, from anything that has been strangled, and from sexual immorality.
\v 26 Then Paul took the men, and the next day, having purified himself along with them, he entered the temple, giving notice of the completion of the days of purification, until the offering was made for each one of them.
\v 27 But as the seven days were about to come to an end, the Jews from Asia, having seen him in the temple, stirred up the entire crowd and laid hands on him.
\v 28 Crying out, "Men of Israel, help! This is the man who is teaching everyone everywhere against the people, the Law, and this place. Moreover, he has brought Greeks into the temple and has defiled this holy place."
\v 29 For they had seen Trophimus the Ephesian in the city with him, whom they supposed that Paul had brought into the temple.
\v 30 And the whole city was stirred up, and a gathering of the people ensued; they seized Paul and dragged him out of the temple, and immediately the doors were closed.
\v 31 As they were seeking to kill him, news reached the commander of the regiment that all Jerusalem was in an uproar.
\v 32 He immediately took soldiers and centurions, and ran down to them. When they saw the commander and the soldiers, they stopped beating Paul.
\v 33 Then the commander approached, seized him, and ordered him to be bound with two chains. He began to inquire who he was and what he had done.
\v 34 But others were shouting different things in the crowd. And since he could not ascertain the truth because of the uproar, he commanded that he be taken into the barracks.
\v 35 And as they were about to take him up the steps, it happened that he was carried by the soldiers due to the violence of the crowd.
\v 36 For the crowd followed, crying out, "Remove him!"
\v 37 As Paul was about to be brought into the barracks, he said to the commander, "May I say something to you?" The commander replied, "Can you speak Greek?"
\v 38 Then the commander said, 'Aren’t you the Egyptian who stirred up trouble some time ago and led four thousand assassins out into the wilderness?'
\v 39 But Paul said, 'I am a man, a Jew from Tarsus in Cilicia, a city of no insignificant reputation; I implore you, allow me to speak to the people.'
\v 40 When he had given him permission, Paul, standing on the steps, motioned with his hand to the people. And when there was a great silence, he spoke to them in the Hebrew language, saying,
\c 22
\p
\v 1 Brothers and fathers, hear my defense before you now.
\v 2 And when they heard that he spoke to them in the Hebrew language, they became even more silent.
\v 3 I am indeed a Jew, born in Tarsus of Cilicia, but brought up in this city at the feet of Gamaliel, instructed according to the exactness of our ancestral law, being zealous for God, just as all of you are today.
\v 4 I persecuted this way to the death, binding and delivering both men and women into prisons.
\v 5 as the high priest and all the council of elders can bear witness. From them, I received letters to the brothers in Damascus, and I was on my way to bring those who were there bound to Jerusalem to be punished.
\v 6 And as I was traveling and drawing near to Damascus, about noon, suddenly a great light shone around me from heaven.
\v 7 I fell to the ground and heard a voice saying to me, ‘Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting me?’
\v 8 And I answered, ‘Who are you, Lord?’ And he said to me, ‘I am Jesus of Nazareth, whom you are persecuting.'
\v 9 Those who were with me saw the light and were filled with fear, but they did not hear the voice of the one who spoke to me.
\v 10 I said, 'What shall I do, Lord?' And the Lord said to me, 'Rise and go to Damascus, and there it will be told you all that is appointed for you to do.'
\v 11 But since I could not see because of the glory of that light, I was led by the hand by those who were with me and came into Damascus.
\v 12 And there was a certain man named Ananias, a devout man according to the law, well-regarded by all the Jews living in Damascus.
\v 13 He came to me, and standing beside me, he said, 'Saul, my brother, receive your sight.' At that very moment, I regained my sight and looked up at him.
\v 14 And he said, 'The God of our fathers has appointed you to know His will and to see the Righteous One, and to hear a voice from His mouth,'.
\v 15 For you will be a witness for Him to all men of what you have seen and heard.
\v 16 And now, what are you waiting for? Rise up, be baptized, and wash away your sins, calling on the name of the Lord.
\v 17 When I returned to Jerusalem and was praying in the temple, I fell into a trance and saw Him saying to me,
\v 18 Make haste and quickly leave Jerusalem, because they will not accept your testimony concerning Me.
\v 19 And I said, 'Lord, they know that I was imprisoning and beating those who believed in You in the synagogues.'
\v 20 And when the blood of Your witness Stephen was shed, I stood by and approved of his execution, guarding the garments of those who killed him.
\v 21 And He said to me, ‘Go, for I will send you far away to the Gentiles.’
\v 22 And they listened to him until he said this word; then they lifted up their voices and shouted, 'Away with such a fellow from the earth! For he is not fit to live.'
\v 23 As they shouted and tossed aside their garments, throwing dust into the air,
\v 24 The commander ordered him to be taken into the barracks, instructing that he should be examined by scourging, to determine the reason for the outcry against him.
\v 25 But when they stretched him out with the thongs, Paul said to the centurion standing by, "Is it lawful for you to scourge a man who is a Roman citizen and uncondemned?"
\v 26 When the centurion heard this, he went and reported to the commander, saying, "Take care what you are about to do, for this man is a Roman citizen."
\v 27 The commander approached Paul and asked, "Tell me, are you a Roman citizen?" And he said, "Yes."
\v 28 The commander replied, "I acquired this citizenship with a great sum of money." But Paul said, "I was born a citizen."
\v 29 Immediately those who were about to examine him withdrew from him, and the commander was afraid when he realized that Paul was a Roman citizen, and that he had bound him.
\v 30 But on the next day, wanting to know the certainty of the charges being brought against him by the Jews, he unbound him and commanded the chief priests and all their council to come together; and he brought Paul down and set him before them.
\c 23
\p
\v 1 Looking intently at the council, Paul said, 'Men, brothers, I have lived my life before God in all good conscience up to this day.'
\v 2 But the high priest Ananias commanded those standing by him to strike him on the mouth.
\v 3 Then Paul said to him, "God will strike you, you whitewashed wall! Are you sitting to judge me according to the Law, and yet contrary to the Law you order me to be struck?"
\v 4 And those who stood by said, "Do you revile the high priest of God?"
\v 5 Paul said, "I did not know, brothers, that he is the high priest; for it is written, ‘You shall not speak evil of a ruler of your people.’"
\v 6 But when Paul perceived that one part of them were Sadducees and the other part were Pharisees, he cried out in the council, 'Men, brothers, I am a Pharisee, a son of Pharisees. I am being judged for the hope and resurrection of the dead.'
\v 7 As he said this, a division arose between the Pharisees and the Sadducees, and the assembly was divided.
\v 8 For the Sadducees say that there is no resurrection, nor angel, nor spirit; but the Pharisees acknowledge both resurrection and angels.
\v 9 And a great uproar arose, and the scribes of the Pharisees' party stood up and argued, saying, 'We find no evil in this man; but if a spirit has spoken to him or an angel, let us not fight against God.'
\v 10 And when there arose a great dissension, fearing that Paul would be torn to pieces by them, the commander ordered the troops to go down and take him by force from their midst and bring him into the barracks.
\v 11 But on the following night, the Lord stood near him and said, 'Take courage, Paul; for as you have testified about Me in Jerusalem, so you must also testify in Rome.'
\v 12 When morning came, some of the Jews formed a conspiracy and bound themselves under an oath, saying that they would neither eat nor drink until they had killed Paul.
\v 13 More than forty men were involved in this conspiracy.
\v 14 These men approached the chief priests and the elders and said, 'We have solemnly bound ourselves by a curse to taste nothing until we have killed Paul.'
\v 15 Now therefore, you and the council make known to the tribune that he should bring him down to you tomorrow, as though you were going to examine more closely the matters concerning him. And we are ready to kill him before he comes near.
\v 16 But when Paul's sister's son heard of their ambush, he went and entered the barracks and told Paul.
\v 17 Then Paul called one of the centurions and said, 'Take this young man to the commander, for he has something to report to him.'
\v 18 So the soldier, taking him, led him to the commander, and said, 'The prisoner Paul called for me and asked me to bring this young man to you, for he has something to say to you.'
\v 19 The commander, taking hold of his hand, withdrew privately and asked him, 'What is it that you have to tell me?'
\v 20 He said that the Jews had agreed to ask you to bring Paul down to the council tomorrow, as they were planning to inquire about him more thoroughly.
\v 21 But do not be persuaded by them; for more than forty men are lying in wait for him, who have bound themselves by an oath neither to eat nor drink until they have killed him. And now they are ready, waiting for your promise.
\v 22 So the commander let the young man go, instructing him not to tell anyone what he had disclosed to him.
\v 23 And having summoned two of the centurions, he said to them, 'Prepare two hundred soldiers to go to Caesarea, along with seventy horsemen and two hundred spearmen, to depart at the third hour of the night.'
\v 24 And provide mounts for him, that he may be safely brought to Felix the governor.
\v 25 He composed a letter that contained the following message:
\v 26 Claudius Lysias sends greetings to the most excellent Governor Felix.
\v 27 This man was seized by the Jews and was about to be killed by them, but when I came with the soldiers and rescued him, I found out that he was a Roman citizen.
\v 28 Desiring to understand the cause for which they accused him, I brought him down to their council.
\v 29 I found him being accused concerning their law; but he had committed nothing worthy of death or imprisonment.
\v 30 But when I learned of a conspiracy against the man, intending to kill him by the Jews, I immediately sent him to you, and instructed his accusers to speak the charges against him before you. Farewell.
\v 31 So the soldiers, taking charge as they had been commanded, brought Paul safely through the night to Antipatris.
\v 32 But the next day, after allowing the horsemen to proceed with him, they returned to the barracks.
\v 33 When they arrived at Caesarea and delivered the letter to the governor, they also presented Paul to him.
\v 34 When the governor read it and asked what province Paul was from, and learning that he was from Cilicia,
\v 35 He said, 'I will give you a hearing when your accusers arrive.' And he commanded that he be kept under guard in Herod's palace.
\c 24
\p
\v 1 Now after five days, the high priest Ananias came down with some of the elders and a certain orator named Tertullus. They presented their case against Paul before the governor.
\v 2 When he was called, Tertullus began to accuse him, saying:
\v 3 In every way and everywhere, we acknowledge this, most excellent Felix, with all gratitude, for the great peace we enjoy through you and for the successes that have come to this nation by your providential care.
\v 4 But in order not to hinder you any further, I beg you to listen to us briefly with your characteristic kindness.
\v 5 For we have found this man to be a plague and a stirrer of dissension among all the Jews throughout the world, and he is the ringleader of the sect of the Nazarenes.
\v 6 He even attempted to profane the temple, and we seized him, intending to judge him according to our law.
\v 7 But Lysias the commander came and took him from us with great violence.
\v 8 Commanding his accusers to come before you, and by examining him yourself, you will be able to learn about all these things of which we accuse him.
\v 9 The Jews also joined in the accusation, affirming that these things were so.
\v 10 Then Paul, after the governor had signaled for him to speak, answered: "Since you have been a judge over this nation for many years, I cheerfully make my defense regarding these accusations against me.
\v 11 You can verify for yourself that I have been in Jerusalem for no more than twelve days since I went there to worship.
\v 12 And neither did they find me in the temple disputing with anyone, nor stirring up a crowd in the synagogues or throughout the city.
\v 13 Nor can they prove the things of which they now accuse me.
\v 14 But I confess to you this: according to the way which they call a sect, I worship the God of my fathers, believing everything laid down in the Law and written in the Prophets.
\v 15 Having hope in God, which these men themselves also accept, that there will be a resurrection of both the just and the unjust.
\v 16 So I strive always to keep my conscience clear before God and man.
\v 17 Now after several years, I came to bring charitable gifts and offerings to my nation.
\v 18 In which they found me purified in the temple, not with a crowd nor in confusion, but rather certain Jews from Asia.
\v 19 Those who should have been here to stand against you and accuse me, if they had anything against me.
\v 20 Or let these men themselves declare what wrongdoing they found in me while I stood before the council.
\v 21 except for this one statement, which I cried out while standing among them, that I am judged today for the hope of the resurrection of the dead.
\v 22 But when Felix heard these things, he postponed their hearing, being more informed about the way, saying, 'When Lysias the tribune comes down, I will make a decision concerning your case.'
\v 23 Then he ordered the centurion to let Paul have some liberty, and he commanded that no one should prevent his friends from attending to his needs.
\v 24 After some days, Felix came with his wife Drusilla, who was Jewish. He sent for Paul and listened to him speak about faith in Christ.
\v 25 As Paul spoke about righteousness, self-control, and the coming judgment, Felix became afraid and replied, "Go away for now; when I find it convenient, I will summon you."
\v 26 At the same time, he hoped that money would be given to him by Paul, so he frequently sent for him and talked with him.
\v 27 But when two years had passed, Felix was succeeded by Porcius Festus. Wanting to do the Jews a favor, Felix left Paul in prison.
\c 25
\p
\v 1 Therefore, when Festus had arrived in the province after three days, he went up to Jerusalem from Caesarea.
\v 2 Then the high priest and the prominent leaders of the Jews brought their accusations against Paul before Festus, earnestly requesting him.
\v 3 They were asking him for a favor concerning Paul, to have him transferred to Jerusalem, while they were planning an ambush to kill him along the way.
\v 4 But Festus answered that Paul was to be kept in custody at Caesarea, and that he himself was about to go there shortly.
\v 5 Therefore, let those who are influential among you, he said, go down with me, and if there is anything wrong with this man, let them bring their charges against him.
\v 6 After spending more than ten days among them, he went down to Caesarea; and the next day, sitting on the judgment seat, he commanded that Paul be brought before him.
\v 7 When he arrived, the Jews who had come down from Jerusalem stood around him, bringing many and serious charges against Paul, which they could not prove.
\v 8 While he made his defense, he declared, 'I have committed no offense against the law of the Jews, nor against the temple, nor against Caesar.'
\v 9 But Festus, wishing to grant the Jews a favor, replied to Paul, 'Are you willing to go up to Jerusalem and be tried there before me concerning these matters?'
\v 10 But Paul said, 'I stand at Caesar's judgment seat, where I ought to be tried. I have done no wrong to the Jews, as you very well know.'
\v 11 For if I have committed any wrong, or have done anything deserving of death, I do not refuse to die. But if there is nothing to the charges these men bring against me, no one can hand me over to them. I appeal to Caesar!
\v 12 Then Festus, having conferred with the council, answered, 'To Caesar you have appealed; to Caesar you shall go.'
\v 13 Now after some days had passed, King Agrippa and Bernice arrived in Caesarea to pay their respects to Festus.
\v 14 As they spent more days there, Festus laid before the king the matters concerning Paul, saying, "A man is being held in custody by Felix."
\v 15 When I arrived in Jerusalem, the chief priests and the elders of the Jews presented their case against him, asking for a verdict.
\v 16 To them I replied that it is not the custom of Romans to hand over any man for destruction before the accused has the opportunity to face his accusers and make a defense concerning the charges.
\v 17 So when they had come together here, I made no delay, but sitting on the judgment seat, I ordered the man to be brought before me.
\v 18 When the accusers stood up, they did not bring any charge of the evil that I had expected.
\v 19 But they had certain disputes with him about their own superstitions and about a Jesus who had died, whom Paul asserted to be alive.
\v 20 But I, being perplexed about this inquiry, asked whether he would be willing to go to Jerusalem and there be tried concerning these matters.
\v 21 But when Paul appealed to be kept for the examination of the Emperor, I commanded him to be guarded until I could send him to Caesar.
\v 22 Then Agrippa said to Festus, 'I would also like to hear this man myself.' Festus replied, 'Tomorrow you shall hear him.'
\v 23 So on the next day, when Agrippa and Bernice had come with great pomp and had entered the auditorium with the commanders and the prominent men of the city, Festus commanded that Paul be brought in.
\v 24 And Festus said, "King Agrippa, and all you gentlemen present with us, you see this man about whom the whole Jewish multitude has petitioned me, both in Jerusalem and here, shouting that he ought not to live any longer."
\v 25 But I, having found nothing deserving of death in him, and when he himself had appealed to Augustus, I decided to send him.
\v 26 I have nothing concrete to write to my lord regarding him; therefore, I have brought him before you, especially before you, King Agrippa, so that after this examination has taken place, I may have something to write.
\v 27 For it seems unreasonable to me to send a prisoner without specifying the charges against him.
\c 26
\p
\v 1 Then Agrippa said to Paul, "You are permitted to speak for yourself." At that moment, Paul stretched out his hand and began his defense.
\v 2 I consider myself fortunate, King Agrippa, that I am about to make my defense today against all the accusations brought against me by the Jews.
\v 3 especially since you are well acquainted with all the customs and controversies of the Jews; therefore, I ask you to listen patiently to my defense.
\v 4 So then, all the Jews are aware of my manner of life from my youth, which was spent from the very beginning among my own people in Jerusalem.
\v 5 They have known me for a long time, if they are willing to testify, that according to the most precise sect of our religion, I lived as a Pharisee.
\v 6 And now I stand here on trial because of the hope of the promise made by God to our ancestors.
\v 7 To this hope, our twelve tribes earnestly serve God day and night, and it is for this hope that I am being accused by the Jews, O King Agrippa.
\v 8 Why is it considered incredible by any of you that God raises the dead?
\v 9 I myself had once thought it necessary to act in many ways against the name of Jesus of Nazareth.
\v 10 This is what I did in Jerusalem; I not only locked many of the saints in prison with the authority I received from the chief priests, but when they were put to death, I cast my vote against them.
\v 11 And in every synagogue, I punished them often, forcing them to blaspheme; and in my rage against them, I relentlessly pursued them even to foreign cities.
\v 12 In this connection, while traveling to Damascus with authority and commission from the chief priests,
\v 13 At midday, O King, along the road, I saw a light from heaven, brighter than the brightness of the sun, shining around me and those who journeyed with me.
\v 14 And when we all had fallen to the ground, I heard a voice speaking to me and saying in the Hebrew language, 'Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting me? It is hard for you to resist what is right and true.'
\v 15 Then I asked, 'Who are you, Lord?' And the Lord replied, 'I am Jesus, whom you are persecuting.'
\v 16 But rise up and stand on your feet; for I have appeared to you for this purpose, to appoint you as a servant and a witness of both the things you have seen and the things I will show you.
\v 17 Delivering you from your own people and from the nations, to whom I am sending you.
\v 18 To open their eyes, so that they may turn from darkness to light and from the power of Satan to God, that they may receive forgiveness of sins and a share among those who are sanctified by faith in me.
\v 19 Therefore, King Agrippa, I was not disobedient to the heavenly vision.
\v 20 but to those in Damascus first, and in Jerusalem, and throughout all the region of Judea, and to the Gentiles, I declared that they should repent and turn to God, performing deeds in keeping with repentance.
\v 21 For this reason, the Jews seized me in the temple and attempted to kill me.
\v 22 Therefore, having obtained help from God, I stand here to this day witnessing to both small and great, saying nothing other than what the prophets and Moses have said would happen.
\v 23 That the Christ would suffer, and being the first to rise from the dead, He would proclaim light to the people and to the Gentiles.
\v 24 As he thus made his defense, Festus said with a loud voice, "Paul, you are beside yourself; much learning is driving you mad!"
\v 25 But he said, "I am not mad, most noble Festus, but I speak words of truth and soundness of mind."
\v 26 For the king knows about these things, to whom I speak freely; for I am convinced that nothing of these matters escapes his notice, for this has not been done in a corner.
\v 27 Do you believe, King Agrippa, in the prophets? I know that you believe.
\v 28 Agrippa replied to Paul, 'In such a short time, are you trying to persuade me to become a Christian?'
\v 29 Paul replied, "I wish before God that whether in a short time or a long time, not only you but all who hear me today might become such as I am, except for these chains."
\v 30 And when he had said these things, the king rose, and the governor, and Bernice, and those who were sitting with them.
\v 31 And after they had departed, they spoke to one another, saying, "This man has done nothing deserving of death or imprisonment."
\v 32 Agrippa said to Festus, 'This man could have been set free if he had not appealed to Caesar.'
\c 27
\p
\v 1 When it was decided that we would sail to Italy, they delivered Paul and some other prisoners to a centurion named Julius, of the Augustan cohort.
\v 2 Boarding a ship from Adramyttium that was set to sail to the regions along Asia, we put out to sea, accompanied by Aristarchus, a Macedonian from Thessalonica.
\v 3 The next day we arrived at Sidon; and Julius, treating Paul kindly, allowed him to go to his friends to receive care.
\v 4 From there we set sail, and we passed by Cyprus because the winds were against us.
\v 5 And when we had sailed across the sea off Cilicia and Pamphylia, we came down to Myra of Lycia.
\v 6 And there the centurion found an Alexandrian ship sailing to Italy, and he put us on board.
\v 7 And after several days of slow sailing, we finally came to Cnidus, with the wind not permitting us to proceed; so we passed along the southern side of Crete, near Salmone.
\v 8 With great difficulty we arrived at a place called Beautiful Harbors, near the city of Lasea.
\v 9 When considerable time had passed and the voyage was already dangerous because the Fast had already gone by, Paul advised them.
\v 10 Saying to them, 'Men, I perceive that the voyage will be with great hardship and much loss, not only of the cargo and the ship, but also of our lives.'
\v 11 But the centurion was more persuaded by the pilot and the ship's owner than by what Paul said.
\v 12 But since the harbor was unsuitable for wintering, most advised to set sail from there, hoping to reach Phoenix, a harbor of Crete facing southwest and northwest, where they could spend the winter.
\v 13 When the south wind blew softly, supposing they had obtained their purpose, they weighed anchor and sailed close to Crete.
\v 14 But shortly thereafter, a tempestuous wind, called Euroclydon, struck down upon them.
\v 15 When the ship was caught and could not withstand the wind, we let her be driven.
\v 16 As we ran under the shelter of a small island called Clauda, we scarcely were able to secure the lifeboat.
\v 17 After hoisting it up, they used supports to secure the ship, fearing they might run aground on the shallows of Syrtis; so they lowered the gear and thus were driven along.
\v 18 And as we were violently tossed about by the storm, the next day they began to jettison cargo.
\v 19 On the third day, we threw the ship's tackle overboard with our own hands.
\v 20 For many days neither sun nor stars appeared, and the storm continued raging. We finally gave up all hope of being saved.
\v 21 After they had gone a long time without food, Paul stood up among them and said: "Men, you should have taken my advice not to sail from Crete; then you would have spared yourselves this damage and loss."
\v 22 And now I urge you to take heart; for there will be no loss of life among you, but only of the ship.
\v 23 For this night, an angel of God stood beside me, the God to whom I belong and serve.
\v 24 saying, 'Do not be afraid, Paul; you must stand trial before Caesar. And behold, God has graciously given you the lives of all who sail with you.'
\v 25 Therefore, take heart, men; for I believe God that it will be just as it was told to me.
\v 26 But we must run aground on some island.
\v 27 But when the fourteenth night had come, as we were being driven across the Adriatic Sea, about midnight the sailors began to suspect that they were nearing some land.
\v 28 And taking soundings, they found twenty fathoms; and when they had gone a little further, they sounded again and found fifteen fathoms.
\v 29 Fearing that we might run aground on rocky shores, they cast four anchors from the stern and prayed for day to come.
\v 30 As the sailors were trying to escape from the ship, they lowered the lifeboat into the sea, pretending that they were about to drop anchors from the bow.
\v 31 Paul said to the centurion and the soldiers, "Unless these men stay aboard the ship, you cannot be saved."
\v 32 Then the soldiers cut the ropes of the lifeboat and let it fall away.
\v 33 Just before dawn, Paul urged everyone to take some food, saying, "This is the fourteenth day that you have been in suspense and without food; you must eat something to sustain yourselves. You cannot go on like this."
\v 34 Therefore, I urge you to partake of some food; this is essential for your survival, for not a hair on the head of any of you will perish.
\v 35 After saying this, he took bread, gave thanks to God in front of everyone, and broke it, beginning to eat.
\v 36 So they all were encouraged and took food themselves.
\v 37 And there were in the ship a total of two hundred seventy-six souls.
\v 38 When they had eaten enough, they lightened the ship by throwing the wheat into the sea.
\v 39 When day came, they did not recognize the land; but they observed a bay with a sandy beach, into which they planned, if possible, to run the ship aground.
\v 40 So they cut the anchors loose and left them in the sea, while at the same time they untied the ropes of the rudders; then, hoisting the sail to the wind, they made for the shore.
\v 41 But when they fell into a place where two seas meet, they ran the ship aground; the bow remained immovable, but the stern was being broken up by the force of the waves.
\v 42 But the soldiers’ plan was to kill the prisoners, lest any of them should swim away and escape.
\v 43 But the centurion, wishing to save Paul, kept them from carrying out their plan. He ordered those who could swim to jump overboard first and make for the land.
\v 44 And the rest, some on boards and some on pieces of the ship. And so it came to pass that all were brought safely to land.
\c 28
\p
\v 1 And after we were safely brought through, we recognized that the island was called Melita.
\v 2 The islanders showed us extraordinary kindness; they built a fire and welcomed us all because it was raining and cold.
\v 3 But when Paul had gathered a bundle of sticks and laid them on the fire, a viper came out because of the heat and fastened on his hand.
\v 4 When the natives saw the creature hanging from his hand, they said to one another, 'Surely this man is a murderer! Though he escaped the sea, Justice has not allowed him to live.'
\v 5 But he shook off the creature into the fire and suffered no harm.
\v 6 But they were waiting for him to swell up or suddenly fall dead; but after they had waited a long time and saw no harm come to him, they changed their minds and said that he was a god.
\v 7 In the region surrounding that place, there was an estate belonging to Publius, the chief official of the island. He welcomed us and entertained us hospitably for three days.
\v 8 And it happened that the father of Publius lay sick with fever and dysentery. Paul went in to him and prayed, and he laid his hands on him and healed him.
\v 9 So when this had happened, the rest of those on the island who had diseases came to him and were healed.
\v 10 They also honored us with many honors; and when we departed, they loaded us with supplies for our needs.
\v 11 After three months, we set sail on an Alexandrian ship that had wintered at the island, adorned with the figurehead of the Dioscuri.
\v 12 And after landing at Syracuse, we stayed there for three days.
\v 13 From there we sailed around and arrived at Rhegium. After one day, a gentle south wind began to blow, and the next day we reached Puteoli.
\v 14 There we found brothers, and they invited us to stay with them for seven days. And so we came to Rome.
\v 15 And from there, the brothers, having heard about us, came out to meet us as far as the Forum of Appius and the Three Taverns. When Paul saw them, he gave thanks to God and took courage.
\v 16 When we arrived in Rome, the centurion delivered the prisoners to the commander of the guard; but Paul was allowed to remain by himself, with the soldier who guarded him.
\v 17 After three days, Paul called together the prominent Jews in Rome. When they had gathered, he said to them, "Brothers, although I have done nothing against our people or the customs of our ancestors, I was delivered as a prisoner from Jerusalem into the hands of the Romans."
\v 18 When they had examined me, they wanted to release me, because they found no reason for any death penalty against me.
\v 19 But when the Jews opposed me, I was compelled to appeal to Caesar, not because I had any accusation against my nation.
\v 20 It is for this reason that I have requested to see you and to speak with you; for it is because of the hope of Israel that I am bound with this chain.
\v 21 But they said to him, 'We have received no letters concerning you from Judea, nor has any of the brethren come here to report or to speak anything evil about you.'
\v 22 But we desire to hear from you what your views are; for concerning this sect, we know that everywhere it is spoken against.
\v 23 And when they had appointed a day for him, many came to him at his lodging; he was explaining to them, testifying about the kingdom of God, and trying to persuade them concerning Jesus from both the Law of Moses and the Prophets, from morning until evening.
\v 24 And some were convinced by what he said, while others refused to believe.
\v 25 But as they disagreed with one another, they began to depart after Paul had spoken this one word: 'The Holy Spirit rightly spoke through the prophet Isaiah to your fathers, saying...'
\v 26 Go to this people and say: 'You will hear but not understand, and you will see but not perceive.'
\v 27 For the heart of this people has become dull, and with their ears they scarcely hear, and they have closed their eyes; otherwise they might see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their heart, and turn, and I would heal them.
\v 28 Therefore, be it known to you that this salvation of God has been sent to the Gentiles; they will indeed listen.
\v 29 And when he had said these things, the Jews departed, having a great dispute among themselves.
\v 30 And Paul stayed two whole years in his own rented house, and welcomed all who came to him.
\v 31 Proclaiming the kingdom of God and teaching the things concerning the Lord Jesus Christ with all boldness, unhindered.
