\v 1 Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God, according to the promise of life that is in Christ Jesus.
\v 2 To Timothy, my beloved son: Grace, mercy, and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.
\v 3 I thank God, whom I serve with a clear conscience as my ancestors did, as I remember you constantly in my prayers night and day.
\v 4 Longing to see you, remembering your tears, so that I may be filled with joy.
\v 5 I am reminded of your sincere faith, which first dwelt in your grandmother Lois and your mother Eunice, and I am convinced is also in you.
\v 6 Therefore, I remind you to rekindle the gift of God that is within you through the laying on of my hands.
\v 7 For God did not give us a spirit of fear, but of power, love, and self-discipline.
\v 8 Therefore, do not be ashamed of the testimony of our Lord, nor of me His prisoner; but share in the suffering for the gospel according to the power of God.
\v 9 Who has saved us and called us with a holy calling, not according to our works, but according to His own purpose and grace, which was given to us in Christ Jesus before the ages began.
\v 10 but has now been made manifest through the appearing of our Savior, Jesus Christ, who has abolished death and brought life and immortality to light through the gospel.
\v 11 For this purpose I was appointed as a herald, an apostle, and a teacher of the nations.
\v 12 Because of this, I also suffer these things; yet I am not ashamed, for I know whom I have believed, and I am convinced that He is able to guard what I have entrusted to Him until that day.
\v 13 Hold fast to the pattern of sound words which you have heard from me, in faith and love that are in Christ Jesus.
\v 14 Guard the good deposit entrusted to you, through the Holy Spirit who dwells within us.
\v 15 You know this, that all those in Asia have turned away from me, of whom are Phygelus and Hermogenes.
\v 16 May the Lord grant mercy to the household of Onesiphorus, for he often refreshed me and was not ashamed of my chains.
\v 17 but when he arrived in Rome, he eagerly searched for me and found me.
\v 18 May the Lord grant him to find mercy from the Lord on that day. You know very well how much he served in Ephesus.
\c 2
\p
\v 1 You then, my child, be strengthened by the grace that is in Christ Jesus.
\v 2 And what you have heard from me in the presence of many witnesses, entrust to faithful men who will be able to teach others also.
\v 3 Therefore, endure hardship as a good soldier of Jesus Christ.
\v 4 No soldier gets entangled in civilian pursuits, since his aim is to please the one who enlisted him.
\v 5 And if anyone competes as an athlete, he is not crowned unless he competes according to the rules.
\v 6 The hardworking farmer ought to be the first to partake of the fruits.
\v 7 Reflect on what I am saying, for the Lord will grant you understanding in everything.
\v 8 Remember Jesus Christ, risen from the dead, descended from David, according to my gospel.
\v 9 For which I suffer hardship even to the point of being chained like a criminal; but the word of God cannot be chained.
\v 10 Therefore, I endure all things for the sake of the elect, so that they too may obtain the salvation that is in Christ Jesus, along with eternal glory.
\v 11 This is a trustworthy saying: if we have died with him, we will also live with him.
\v 12 If we endure, we will also reign with Him; if we deny Him, He will also deny us.
\v 13 If we are faithless, He remains faithful; He cannot deny Himself.
\v 14 Remind them of these things, testifying before the Lord not to engage in quarrels that are of no benefit, leading only to the ruin of those who hear.
\v 15 Do your utmost to present yourself approved to God, a worker who does not need to be ashamed, accurately handling the word of truth.
\v 16 But avoid profane and empty chatter, for they will only lead to further ungodliness.
\v 17 And their word will spread like gangrene; among them are Hymenaeus and Philetus.
\v 18 They have deviated from the truth, claiming that the resurrection has already occurred, and they are undermining the faith of some.
\v 19 However, the solid foundation of God stands firm, having this seal: "The Lord knows those who are His," and, "Let everyone who names the name of the Lord depart from iniquity."
\v 20 But in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and silver, but also of wood and clay; some are for honor, and some for dishonor.
\v 21 Therefore, if anyone cleanses himself from these, he will be a vessel for honor, sanctified and useful to the Master, prepared for every good work.
\v 22 So flee youthful passions, and pursue righteousness, faith, love, and peace, along with those who call on the Lord out of a pure heart.
\v 23 But refuse foolish and ignorant disputes, knowing that they breed quarrels.
\v 24 And the servant of the Lord must not be quarrelsome, but kind to everyone, able to teach, patiently enduring wrong.
\v 25 correcting his opponents with gentleness; perhaps God may grant them repentance leading to a knowledge of the truth.
\v 26 and they may come to their senses and escape from the snare of the devil, after being captured by him to do his will.

\v 1 But know this: in the last days, perilous times will come.
\v 2 For men will be lovers of themselves, lovers of money, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy.
\v 3 Without natural affection, untrustworthy, slanderous, without self-control, brutal, not lovers of good.
\v 4 traitors, reckless, conceited, lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God,
\v 5 They will have the appearance of godliness, but deny its power. Avoid such people.
\v 6 For among them are those who creep into households and captivate weak women, burdened with sins and led by various desires.
\v 7 Always seeking knowledge, but never able to arrive at the full understanding of the truth.
\v 8 Just as Janes and Jambres opposed Moses, so also these men oppose the truth; they are men of depraved minds, unfit for faith.
\v 9 But they will not advance any further; for their folly will be evident to all, just as the folly of those men became.
\v 10 But you have followed closely my teaching, my conduct, my purpose, my faith, my patience, my love, and my endurance.
\v 11 My persecutions and sufferings, such as those I endured in Antioch, Iconium, and Lystra; what persecutions I faced! Yet the Lord delivered me from them all.
\v 12 Indeed, all who wish to lead a life of godliness in Christ Jesus will be persecuted.
\v 13 But wicked men and deceivers will progress from bad to worse, deceiving and being deceived.
\v 14 But you must continue in the things you have learned and have been assured of, knowing from whom you learned them.
\v 15 and that from childhood you have known the sacred Scriptures, which are able to make you wise for salvation through faith in Christ Jesus.
\v 16 All Scripture is breathed out by God and is useful for teaching, for reproof, for correction, and for training in righteousness.
\v 17 so that the man of God may be complete, equipped for every good work.

\p
\v 1 I solemnly charge you in the presence of God and of Christ Jesus, who is to judge the living and the dead, and by His appearing and His kingdom.
\v 2 Preach the Word; be ready in season and out of season; reprove, rebuke, and encourage, with all patience and teaching.
\v 3 For the time will come when they will not endure sound teaching, but having itching ears, they will accumulate for themselves teachers to suit their own desires.
\v 4 And they will turn away from listening to the truth and wander off into myths.
\v 5 But you, be sober in all things, endure hardship, do the work of an evangelist, fulfill your ministry.
\v 6 For I am already being poured out as a drink offering, and the time for my departure is at hand.
\v 7 I have fought the good fight, I have finished the race, I have kept the faith.
\v 8 Now there is laid up for me the crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous Judge, will give to me on that day; and not to me only, but also to all who have loved His appearing.
\v 9 Make every effort to come to me quickly;.
\v 10 For Demas has forsaken me, having loved this present age, and has departed for Thessalonica; Crescens has gone to Galatia, Titus to Dalmatia.
\v 11 Only Luke is with me. Get Mark and bring him with you, for he is useful to me in ministry.
\v 12 But I have sent Tychicus to Ephesus.
\v 13 When you come, bring the cloak that I left with Carpus at Troas, and the scrolls, especially the parchments.
\v 14 Alexander the coppersmith did me great harm; the Lord will repay him according to his deeds.
\v 15 Be on guard against him; for he has greatly opposed our words.
\v 16 At my first defense, no one stood by me, but everyone deserted me. May it not be held against them.
\v 17 But the Lord stood by me and strengthened me, so that through me the message might be fully proclaimed and all the Gentiles might hear it. And I was rescued from the lion's mouth.
\v 18 And the Lord will rescue me from every evil deed and bring me safely into His heavenly kingdom; to Him be glory forever and ever. Amen.
\v 19 Greet Priscilla and Aquila, and the household of Onesiphorus.
\v 20 Erastus stayed in Corinth, and I left Trophimus sick in Miletus.
\v 21 Make every effort to come before winter. Eubulus, Pudens, Linus, and Claudia send their greetings, along with all the brothers.
\v 22 The Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. May grace be with you.
