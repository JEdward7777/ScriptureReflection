\v 1 The record of the genealogy of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham.
\v 2 Abraham fathered Isaac, Isaac fathered Jacob, and Jacob fathered Judah and his brothers.
\v 3 Judah fathered Perez and Zerah by Tamar, and Perez fathered Hezron, and Hezron fathered Ram.
\v 4 Ram fathered Amminadab, Amminadab fathered Nahshon, and Nahshon fathered Salmon.
\v 5 Salmon fathered Boaz by Rahab, and Boaz fathered Obed by Ruth, and Obed fathered Jesse.
\v 6 And Jesse fathered David, the king; and David, the king, fathered Solomon by the wife of Uriah.
\v 7 Solomon fathered Rehoboam, Rehoboam fathered Abijah, and Abijah fathered Asa.
\v 8 And Asa fathered Jehoshaphat; Jehoshaphat fathered Joram; and Joram fathered Uzziah.
\v 9 Uzziah fathered Jotham; Jotham fathered Ahaz; and Ahaz fathered Hezekiah.
\v 10 Hezekiah fathered Manasseh; Manasseh fathered Amon; and Amon fathered Josiah.
\v 11 And Josiah fathered Jeconiah and his brothers at the time of the Babylonian exile.
\v 12 After the Babylonian exile, Jeconiah became the father of Shealtiel, and Shealtiel became the father of Zerubbabel.
\v 13 Zerubbabel fathered Abiud, Abiud fathered Eliakim, and Eliakim fathered Azor.
\v 14 Azor fathered Sadok, Sadok fathered Achim, and Achim fathered Elihud.
\v 15 Elihud fathered Eleazar, Eleazar fathered Matthan, and Matthan fathered Jacob.
\v 16 And Jacob fathered Joseph, the husband of Mary, of whom was born Jesus, who is called Christ.
\v 17 So all the generations from Abraham to David are fourteen generations, and from David until the exile to Babylon are fourteen generations, and from the exile to Babylon until Christ are fourteen generations.
\v 18 Now the birth of Jesus Christ took place in this way: when His mother Mary had been pledged to Joseph, before they came together, she was found to be with child by the Holy Spirit.
\v 19 But Joseph her husband, being a just man and not willing to make her a public example, was minded to put her away secretly.
\v 20 But while he pondered these things, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream, saying, 'Joseph, son of David, do not be afraid to take Mary as your wife; for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Spirit.'
\v 21 And she will give birth to a Son, and you shall name Him Jesus, for He will save His people from their sins.
\v 22 All this took place to fulfill what was spoken by the Lord through the prophet, saying:
\v 23 Behold, the virgin shall conceive in her womb and bear a son, and they shall call his name Emmanuel, which means 'God with us.'
\v 24 And when Joseph awoke from his sleep, he did as the angel of the Lord had commanded him, and took his wife.
\v 25 And he did not know her intimately until she had given birth to her firstborn son, and he named him Jesus.
\c 2
\p
\v 1 Now after Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea in the days of King Herod, behold, wise men from the east came to Jerusalem.
\v 2 saying, ‘Where is the one who has been born king of the Jews? For we have seen his star in the east and have come to worship him.’
\v 3 When King Herod heard this, he was disturbed, and all Jerusalem with him.
\v 4 And gathering together all the chief priests and scribes of the people, he asked them where the Christ was to be born.
\v 5 They replied, "In Bethlehem of Judea, for this is what has been written through the prophet:"
\v 6 And you, Bethlehem, in the land of Judah, are by no means the least among the rulers of Judah; for out of you will come a leader who will shepherd my people Israel.
\v 7 Then Herod secretly called for the Magi and ascertained from them the exact time the star had appeared.
\v 8 And he sent them to Bethlehem, saying, 'Go and search diligently for the child; and when you find him, report back to me, so that I too may come and worship him.'
\v 9 When they heard the king, they went on their way; and behold, the star that they had seen in the east went before them until it came to rest over the place where the child was.
\v 10 When they saw the star, they rejoiced with exceedingly great joy.
\v 11 And entering the house, they saw the child with Mary his mother; and falling down, they worshipped him. And opening their treasures, they offered him gifts: gold, frankincense, and myrrh.
\v 12 And having been warned in a dream not to return to Herod, they departed for their own country by another way.
\v 13 Now after they had departed, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream, saying, 'Rise, take the child and his mother, and flee to Egypt, and remain there until I tell you; for Herod is about to search for the child, to destroy him.'
\v 14 And he arose, took the child and his mother by night, and withdrew to Egypt.
\v 15 And he remained there until the death of Herod, in order that what was spoken by the Lord through the prophet might be fulfilled, saying: 'Out of Egypt, I called My Son.'
\v 16 Then Herod, seeing that he had been deceived by the wise men, was exceedingly angry; and sending forth, he killed all the male children in Bethlehem and in all its vicinity who were two years old and under, according to the time which he had determined from the wise men.
\v 17 Then what was spoken through the prophet Jeremiah was fulfilled, saying:
\v 18 A voice was heard in Ramah, weeping and loud lamentation; Rachel is weeping for her children, and she refuses to be comforted, because they are no more.
\v 19 But when Herod had died, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream while he was in Egypt.
\v 20 saying, 'Rise, take the child and his mother, and go to the land of Israel, for those who sought the child's life are dead.'
\v 21 And he arose, took the child and his mother, and went to the land of Israel.
\v 22 But upon hearing that Archelaus was reigning over Judea in place of his father Herod, he was afraid to go there; and having been warned in a dream, he withdrew to the regions of Galilee.
\v 23 And he came and dwelt in a city called Nazareth, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophets, 'He shall be called a Nazarene.'
\c 3
\p
\v 1 In those days, John the Baptist appeared, preaching in the wilderness of Judea.
\v 2 And saying, 'Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is drawing near.'
\v 3 For this is he who was spoken of by the prophet Isaiah, saying: 'The voice of one crying in the wilderness, prepare the way of the Lord; make His paths straight.'
\v 4 Now John himself had clothing made of camel's hair, with a leather belt around his waist, and his food was locusts and wild honey.
\v 5 Then people from Jerusalem and all of Judea, and all the region around the Jordan, went out to him.
\v 6 And they were baptized by him in the Jordan River, confessing their sins.
\v 7 But when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming to his baptism, he said to them, 'You brood of vipers! Who warned you to flee from the coming wrath?'
\v 8 Therefore, produce fruit that reflects true repentance.
\v 9 And do not presume to say among yourselves, ‘We have Abraham as our father.’ For I tell you, God is able to raise up children for Abraham from these stones.
\v 10 The axe is already laid at the root of the trees; therefore, every tree that does not produce good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.
\v 11 I indeed baptize you with water for repentance; but the one coming after me is mightier than I, whose sandals I am not worthy to carry; he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and with fire.
\v 12 His winnowing fork is in his hand, and he will thoroughly clean out his threshing floor; he will gather his wheat into the barn, but the chaff he will burn with unquenchable fire.
\v 13 Then Jesus came from Galilee to the Jordan, to John, to be baptized by him.
\v 14 But John tried to prevent Him, saying, "I have need to be baptized by You, and are You coming to me?"
\v 15 But Jesus answered him, saying, "Let it be so now, for it is fitting for us to fulfill all righteousness." Then John consented to Him.
\v 16 As soon as Jesus was baptized, He came up out of the water. At that moment, the heavens were opened to Him, and He saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and coming to rest on Him.
\v 17 And behold, a voice from the heavens declared, 'This is my beloved Son, in whom I take great delight.'
\c 4
\p
\v 1 Then Jesus was led by the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted by the devil.
\v 2 And after fasting for forty days and forty nights, He was hungry.
\v 3 And the tempter approached Him and said, 'If you are indeed the Son of God, command these stones to become bread.'
\v 4 But He answered and said, 'It is written, Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that comes forth from the mouth of God.'
\v 5 Then the devil took Him to the holy city and set Him on the pinnacle of the temple.
\v 6 And he said to Him, 'If you are the Son of God, throw yourself down; for it is written, ‘He will command His angels concerning you,’ and ‘They will lift you up in their hands, so that you will not strike your foot against a stone.’
\v 7 Jesus said to him, 'It is also written: You shall not put the Lord your God to the test.'
\v 8 Again, the devil took him to a very high mountain and showed him all the kingdoms of the world and their glory.
\v 9 And he said to him, "All these things I will give you if you fall down and worship me."
\v 10 Then Jesus said to him, "Be gone, Satan! For it is written, 'You shall worship the Lord your God and serve Him alone.'"
\v 11 Then the devil departed from him, and behold, angels came and began to serve him.
\v 12 Now when Jesus heard that John had been handed over, he withdrew to Galilee.
\v 13 And leaving Nazareth, he went and settled in Capernaum, by the sea, in the region of Zebulun and Naphtali.
\v 14 so that what was spoken by the prophet Isaiah might be fulfilled, saying:
\v 15 The land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali, the road by the sea, across from the Jordan, Galilee of the Gentiles.
\v 16 The people who sat in darkness have seen a great light; and to those who dwelt in the region and shadow of death, light has dawned upon them.
\v 17 From that time on, Jesus began to preach and say, "Repent, for the kingdom of heaven has drawn near."
\v 18 As Jesus walked along the shore of the Sea of Galilee, He saw two brothers, Simon, called Peter, and his brother Andrew, casting a net into the sea, for they were fishermen.
\v 19 And He said to them, 'Come, follow Me, and I will make you fishers of men.'
\v 20 And immediately they left their nets and followed Him.
\v 21 And going on from there, He saw two other brothers, James the son of Zebedee and John his brother, in the boat with their father Zebedee, mending their nets, and He called them.
\v 22 And immediately they left the boat and their father and followed Him.
\v 23 And Jesus traveled throughout all of Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, proclaiming the good news of the kingdom, and healing every sickness and every disease among the people.
\v 24 And news about Him spread throughout all of Syria, and they brought to Him all who were afflicted with various diseases and pains, those oppressed by demons, those suffering from seizures, and the paralyzed; and He healed them.
\v 25 And great crowds followed Him from Galilee, the Decapolis, Jerusalem, Judea, and beyond the Jordan.
\c 5
\p
\v 1 Seeing the crowds, He went up on the mountain, and when He sat down, His disciples came to Him.
\v 2 And He opened His mouth and began to teach them, saying:
\v 3 Blessed are the humble in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
\v 4 Blessed are those who mourn, for they shall be comforted.
\v 5 Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the earth.
\v 6 Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they shall be filled.
\v 7 Blessed are the merciful, for they shall obtain mercy.
\v 8 Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God.
\v 9 Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be recognized as children of God.
\v 10 Blessed are those who are persecuted because of righteousness, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
\v 11 Blessed are you when they revile you and persecute you, and say all kinds of evil against you falsely for My sake.
\v 12 Rejoice and be exceedingly glad, for your reward is great in heaven; for so they persecuted the prophets who were before you.
\v 13 You are the salt of the earth; but if the salt should lose its flavor, with what shall it be salted? It is no longer good for anything except to be thrown out and trampled underfoot by men.
\v 14 You are the light of the world. A city set on a hill cannot be hidden.
\v 15 Neither do they light a lamp and place it under a basket, but on a lampstand, and it gives light to all who are in the house.
\v 16 In the same way, let your light shine before others, so that they may see your good works and give glory to your Father who is in heaven.
\v 17 Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them.
\v 18 Truly, I say to you, until heaven and earth pass away, not a single dot or stroke will disappear from the Law until all is accomplished.
\v 19 Therefore, whoever relaxes one of the least of these commandments and teaches others to do the same will be called least in the kingdom of heaven; but whoever does them and teaches them will be called great in the kingdom of heaven.
\v 20 For I say to you that unless your righteousness surpasses that of the scribes and Pharisees, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven.
\v 21 You have heard that it was said to the ancients, 'You shall not commit murder,' and whoever commits murder will be subject to judgment.
\v 22 But I say to you that everyone who is angry with his brother without cause shall be liable to judgment; and whoever says to his brother, 'You fool!' shall be liable to the council; and whoever says, 'You worthless one!' shall be liable to hellfire.
\v 23 So if you are presenting your offering at the altar, and there remember that your brother has something against you,
\v 24 Leave your gift there at the altar and first go and be reconciled to your brother; then come and offer your gift.
\v 25 Agree with your adversary quickly, while you are on the way with him, lest your adversary deliver you to the judge, the judge hand you over to the officer, and you be thrown into prison.
\v 26 Truly, I say to you, you will not leave there until you have paid the very last penny.
\v 27 You have heard that it was said, 'You shall not commit adultery.'
\v 28 But I say to you that everyone who looks at a woman with the intention to lust for her has already committed adultery with her in his heart.
\v 29 But if your right eye causes you to stumble, tear it out and throw it away. For it is better for you to lose one part of your body than for your whole body to be thrown into hell.
\v 30 And if your right hand causes you to stumble, cut it off and throw it away from you; for it is better for you to lose one of your members than for your whole body to be thrown into hell.
\v 31 It has been said, ‘Whoever divorces his wife must give her a written notice of divorce.’
\v 32 But I say to you that whoever divorces his wife, except for reasons of sexual immorality, causes her to commit adultery, and whoever marries a divorced woman commits adultery.
\v 33 Again, you have heard that it was said to the ancients, 'You shall not break your oaths, but you shall fulfill to the Lord your vows.'
\v 34 But I say to you, do not swear at all; neither by heaven, for it is the throne of God,
\v 35 And do not swear by the earth, for it is the footstool of His feet; nor by Jerusalem, for it is the city of the great King.
\v 36 And do not swear by your head, for you cannot make one hair white or black.
\v 37 Let your word be simply yes or no; anything more than this comes from the evil one.
\v 38 You have heard that it was said, 'An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth.'
\v 39 But I say to you, do not resist the one who is evil; but if anyone slaps you on the right cheek, turn to him the other also.
\v 40 And if anyone wants to sue you and take your tunic, let him have your cloak as well.
\v 41 And whoever compels you to go one mile, go with him two.
\v 42 Give to the one who asks of you, and do not turn away from the one who wants to borrow from you.
\v 43 You have heard that it was said, 'You shall love your neighbor and hate your enemy.'
\v 44 But I tell you, love your enemies, bless those who curse you, do good to those who hate you, and pray for those who persecute you.
\v 45 so that you may be children of your Father in heaven. For He causes His sun to rise on both the evil and the good, and He sends rain on the righteous and the unrighteous.
\v 46 For if you love those who love you, what reward do you have? Do not even tax collectors do the same?
\v 47 And if you greet only your friends, what more are you doing than others? Do not even the tax collectors do the same?
\v 48 Therefore, you are to be perfect, as your heavenly Father is perfect.
\c 6
\p
\v 1 Beware of practicing your righteousness before others in order to be seen by them. For if you do, you will have no reward from your Father who is in heaven.
\v 2 Therefore, when you give to the needy, do not sound a trumpet before you, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets, that they may be honored by men. Truly I say to you, they have received their reward.
\v 3 But when you give to the needy, let not your left hand know what your right hand is doing,
\v 4 So that your charitable giving may be in secret; and your Father who sees what is done in secret will reward you openly.
\v 5 And when you pray, you shall not be like the hypocrites, for they love to stand and pray in the synagogues and at the corners of the streets, that they may be seen by men. Truly, I say to you, they have their reward.
\v 6 But when you pray, go into your private room, and shutting the door, pray to your Father who is in the secret place; and your Father who sees what is done in secret will reward you openly.
\v 7 And when you pray, do not use meaningless repetition like the Gentiles, for they think that they will be heard for their many words.
\v 8 Therefore, do not be like them; for your Father knows what you need before you ask Him.
\v 9 In this manner, therefore, you should pray: Our Father who is in heaven, may Your name be kept holy.
\v 10 Let Your kingdom come; let Your will be done, on earth as it is in heaven.
\v 11 Give us today the bread we need for this day.
\v 12 And forgive us our debts, as we also forgive our debtors.
\v 13 And do not lead us into temptation, but deliver us from the evil one. For yours is the kingdom and the power and the glory, forever. Amen.
\v 14 For if you forgive others their wrongdoings, your heavenly Father will also forgive you.
\v 15 But if you do not release others from their offenses, neither will your Father in heaven release your offenses.
\v 16 When you fast, do not look somber as the hypocrites do, for they disfigure their faces to show others they are fasting. Truly I tell you, they have received their reward in full.
\v 17 But when you fast, anoint your head and wash your face.
\v 18 so that it will not be seen by others that you are fasting, but by your Father who is in secret; and your Father who sees in secret will reward you openly.
\v 19 Do not store up treasures for yourselves on earth, where moths and rust destroy, and where thieves break in and steal.
\v 20 But store up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust destroys, and where thieves do not break in and steal.
\v 21 For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.
\v 22 The eye is the lamp of the body; if your eye is healthy, your whole body will be full of light.
\v 23 But if your eye is unhealthy, your whole body will be full of darkness. If then the light within you is darkness, how great is that darkness?
\v 24 No one can serve two masters; for he will either hate one and love the other, or be devoted to one and disregard the other. You cannot serve God and wealth.
\v 25 Therefore, I tell you, do not be anxious about your life, what you will eat or what you will drink, nor about your body, what you will wear. Is not life more than food, and the body more than clothing?
\v 26 Look at the birds of the air: they neither sow nor reap nor gather into barns, yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not of more value than they?
\v 27 And which of you by worrying can add a single cubit to his height?
\v 28 And why do you worry about clothing? Observe the lilies of the field, how they grow; they do not labor or spin.
\v 29 But I tell you that not even Solomon in all his glory was clothed like one of these.
\v 30 But if God clothes the grass of the field, which is alive today and tomorrow is thrown into the fire, will He not much more clothe you, O you of little faith?
\v 31 Therefore, do not be anxious, saying, 'What will we eat?' or 'What will we drink?' or 'What will we wear?'
\v 32 For the Gentiles eagerly seek all these things; for your heavenly Father knows that you need all these.
\v 33 But seek first the kingdom of God and His righteousness, and all these things will be given to you as well.
\v 34 Therefore, do not be anxious about tomorrow, for tomorrow will take care of itself. Each day has enough trouble of its own.
\c 7
\p
\v 1 Do not judge others, so that you will not be judged.
\v 2 For with the measure you use, it will be measured to you; and the standard by which you judge, you will be judged.
\v 3 Why do you see the speck in your brother's eye, but do not notice the beam that is in your own eye?
\v 4 Or how can you say to your brother, ‘Let me take the speck out of your eye,’ when there is a beam in your own eye?
\v 5 You hypocrite! First, take the log out of your own eye, and then you will see clearly to take the speck out of your brother's eye.
\v 6 Do not give what is holy to dogs, nor cast your pearls before swine, lest they trample them under their feet and turn and tear you to pieces.
\v 7 Ask, and it will be given to you; seek, and you will find; knock, and it will be opened to you.
\v 8 For everyone who asks receives, and he who seeks finds, and to him who knocks, it will be opened.
\v 9 Or what man among you, if his son asks for bread, will give him a stone?
\v 10 And if he asks for a fish, will he give him a serpent?
\v 11 If you, being evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father who is in heaven give good things to those who ask Him?
\v 12 Therefore, whatever you wish that others would do to you, do also to them; for this is the essence of the Law and the Prophets.
\v 13 Enter through the narrow gate; for the gate is wide and the path is spacious that leads to destruction, and many are those who enter through it.
\v 14 How narrow is the gate, and how troubled is the path that leads to life! And there are few who find it.
\v 15 Beware of false prophets, who come to you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly they are ravenous wolves.
\v 16 You will know them by their fruits. Do people gather grapes from thornbushes or figs from thistles?
\v 17 In the same way, every good tree produces good fruit, but a rotten tree produces bad fruit.
\v 18 A good tree cannot bear bad fruit, nor can a bad tree bear good fruit.
\v 19 Every tree that does not produce good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.
\v 20 Therefore, by their fruits you will recognize them.
\v 21 Not everyone who says to me, 'Lord, Lord,' will enter the kingdom of heaven, but only the one who does the will of my Father who is in heaven.
\v 22 Many will say to me on that day, 'Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name, and in your name cast out demons, and in your name perform many mighty works?'
\v 23 And then I will declare to them, 'I never knew you; depart from me, you workers of lawlessness.'
\v 24 Therefore, everyone who hears these words of mine and puts them into practice is like a wise man who built his house on the rock.
\v 25 And the rain fell, and the rivers came, and the winds blew and beat against that house, yet it did not fall, for it was founded upon the rock.
\v 26 And everyone who hears these words of mine and does not act on them will be like a foolish man who built his house on the sand.
\v 27 And the rain fell, and the rivers came, and the winds blew and struck that house; and it fell, and great was its fall.
\v 28 And it came to pass that when Jesus had finished these words, the crowds were amazed at his teaching.
\v 29 For He taught them with authority, and not as the scribes.
\c 8
\p
\v 1 When He came down from the mountain, great crowds followed Him.
\v 2 And behold, a leper came to Him, and knelt before Him, saying, 'Lord, if You are willing, You can make me clean.'
\v 3 And stretching out His hand, Jesus touched him, saying, 'I am willing; be cleansed.' And immediately his leprosy was cleansed.
\v 4 And Jesus said to him, "See that you tell no one; but go, show yourself to the priest and offer the gift that Moses commanded, as a testimony to them."
\v 5 When He entered Capernaum, a centurion approached Him, pleading with Him and saying,
\v 6 "Lord, my servant is lying at home paralyzed, suffering greatly."
\v 7 And Jesus said to him, 'I will come and heal him.'
\v 8 But the centurion answered and said, 'Lord, I am not worthy that You should come under my roof; only speak a word, and my servant will be healed.'
\v 9 For I am a man under authority, having soldiers under me. I say to this one, 'Go,' and he goes; and to another, 'Come,' and he comes; and to my servant, 'Do this,' and he does it.
\v 10 When Jesus heard this, He marveled and said to those who followed Him, "Truly, I say to you, I have not found such great faith, even in Israel."
\v 11 But I say to you that many will come from the east and the west and will sit down with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven.
\v 12 But the sons of the kingdom will be cast out into outer darkness; there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.
\v 13 And Jesus said to the centurion, "Go; as you have believed, let it be done for you." And his servant was healed at that very hour.
\v 14 And when Jesus entered Peter's house, he saw his mother-in-law lying sick with a fever.
\v 15 And He touched her hand, and the fever left her; and she arose and began to serve Him.
\v 16 When evening came, they brought to Him many who were possessed by demons, and He cast out the spirits with a word and healed all who were sick.
\v 17 Thus fulfilling what was spoken through the prophet Isaiah: "He took our weaknesses upon Himself and carried our diseases."
\v 18 When Jesus saw the large crowds around Him, He commanded them to depart to the other side.
\v 19 And a scribe came to Him and said, "Teacher, I will follow You wherever You go."
\v 20 And Jesus said to him, "The foxes have their dens, and the birds of the air have their nests, but the Son of Man has nowhere to rest His head."
\v 21 Another of His disciples said to Him, "Lord, permit me first to go and bury my father."
\v 22 But Jesus said to him, "Follow Me, and let the spiritually dead bury their own dead."
\v 23 And when He entered the boat, His disciples followed Him.
\v 24 And behold, a great storm arose on the sea, so that the boat was being swamped by the waves; but He was asleep.
\v 25 And approaching Him, His disciples awoke Him, saying, "Lord, save us; we are perishing!"
\v 26 But He said to them, "Why are you afraid, you of little faith?" Then He rose and rebuked the winds and the sea, and there was a great calm.
\v 27 And the men marveled, saying, "What kind of man is this, that even the winds and the sea obey him?"
\v 28 And when He had come to the other side, to the region of the Gadarenes, two demon-possessed men met Him, coming out of the tombs; they were exceedingly fierce, so that no one could pass that way.
\v 29 And behold, they cried out, saying, 'What do You have to do with us, Jesus, Son of God? Have You come here to torment us before the appointed time?'
\v 30 Now there was a large herd of many swine feeding at a distance from them.
\v 31 The demons, however, implored Him, saying, 'If You cast us out, permit us to go away into the herd of pigs.'
\v 32 And He said to them, "Go." So they went out and entered the herd of pigs; and behold, the entire herd of pigs rushed down the steep bank into the sea and perished in the waters.
\v 33 But the herdsmen fled, and going into the city, they reported everything that had happened, including what had occurred with the demon-possessed men.
\v 34 And behold, all the people of the city came out to meet Jesus; and when they saw Him, they begged Him to depart from their region.
\c 9
\p
\v 1 And He got into a boat, crossed over, and arrived at His own city.
\v 2 And behold, they brought to Him a paralytic lying on a bed; and when Jesus saw their faith, He said to the paralytic, 'Take heart, son; your sins are forgiven.'
\v 3 And behold, some of the scribes said among themselves, 'This man is speaking blasphemy.'
\v 4 And Jesus, perceiving their thoughts, said, "Why do you harbor evil intentions in your hearts?"
\v 5 For which is easier to say, 'Your sins are forgiven,' or to say, 'Rise up and walk?'
\v 6 But so that you may understand that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins, he then said to the paralytic, 'Get up, take your bed, and go home.'
\v 7 And rising up, he went away to his house.
\v 8 But when the crowds saw it, they were filled with awe and glorified God, who had given such authority to men.
\v 9 As Jesus passed on from there, He saw a man sitting at the tax booth, named Matthew, and He said to him, 'Follow Me.' And he arose and followed Him.
\v 10 And it happened that as Jesus was reclining in the house, behold, many tax collectors and sinners came and reclined with Him and His disciples.
\v 11 When the Pharisees saw this, they said to His disciples, 'Why does your Teacher eat with tax collectors and sinners?'
\v 12 But when Jesus heard this, He said to them, 'It is not the healthy who need a physician, but the sick.'
\v 13 But go and learn what this means: 'I desire mercy, not sacrifice.' For I have come not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.
\v 14 Then the disciples of John came to Him, asking, 'Why do we and the Pharisees fast often, but Your disciples do not fast?'
\v 15 And Jesus said to them, 'Can the sons of the bridechamber mourn while the bridegroom is with them? As long as they have the bridegroom with them, they cannot mourn. But the days will come when the bridegroom will be taken away from them, and then they will fast.'
\v 16 No one sews a patch of unshrunken cloth onto an old garment; for the patch will pull away from the garment, and a worse tear will result.
\v 17 Neither do they put new wine into old wineskins; otherwise the skins burst, and the wine spills out, and the wineskins are ruined. But they put new wine into new wineskins, and both are preserved.
\v 18 While he was speaking these things to them, behold, a ruler came and knelt before him, saying, 'My daughter has just died; but come and lay your hand on her, and she will live.'
\v 19 And Jesus arose and followed him, along with his disciples.
\v 20 And behold, a woman who had been suffering from a flow of blood for twelve years came up behind Him and touched the fringe of His garment.
\v 21 For she said to herself, 'If I can just touch His garment, I will be healed.'
\v 22 But Jesus turned, and when He saw her, He said, "Take courage, daughter; your faith has healed you." And from that hour, the woman was made whole.
\v 23 And when Jesus arrived at the ruler's house and saw the flute players and the noisy crowd, He said to them,
\v 24 'Go away, for the girl is not dead; she is just sleeping.' And they laughed at Him.
\v 25 But when the crowd had been put outside, He went in, took her by the hand, and the girl arose.
\v 26 And this report spread throughout all that land.
\v 27 And as Jesus went on from there, two blind men followed Him, crying out, "Have mercy on us, Son of David!"
\v 28 When He entered the house, the blind men approached Him, and Jesus said to them, "Do you believe that I am able to do this?" They said to Him, "Yes, Lord."
\v 29 Then He touched their eyes, saying, "Let it be done to you according to your faith."
\v 30 And their eyes were opened. Jesus sternly warned them, saying, "See that no one knows it."
\v 31 But when they went out, they widely proclaimed Him throughout all that region.
\v 32 As they were leaving, behold, they brought to Him a man who was mute and possessed by a demon.
\v 33 And when the demon was cast out, the mute spoke; and the crowds were astonished, saying, 'Never has anything like this been seen in Israel!'
\v 34 But the Pharisees said, 'He casts out demons by the ruler of demons.'
\v 35 And Jesus went about all the cities and villages, teaching in their synagogues, proclaiming the good news of the kingdom, and healing every disease and every ailment among the people.
\v 36 But when He saw the crowds, He was moved with compassion for them, because they were distressed and dejected, like sheep without a shepherd.
\v 37 Then He said to His disciples, 'The harvest is indeed abundant, but the laborers are few.'
\v 38 Therefore, plead with the Lord of the harvest to send out laborers into His harvest.
\c 10
\p
\v 1 And having called His twelve disciples to Him, He gave them authority over unclean spirits, to cast them out, and to heal every disease and every affliction.
\v 2 Now, these are the names of the twelve apostles: first, Simon, who is called Peter, and his brother Andrew; James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother.
\v 3 Philip and Bartholomew; Thomas and Matthew the tax collector; James the son of Alphaeus, and Thaddeus, who is also called Lebbaeus.
\v 4 Simon the Zealot, and Judas Iscariot, who also betrayed Him.
\v 5 These twelve Jesus sent out, commanding them, saying, 'Do not go on the road of the Gentiles, and do not enter a city of the Samaritans;'
\v 6 But rather go to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.
\v 7 As you go, preach, saying, 'The kingdom of heaven has come near.'
\v 8 Heal the sick, cleanse those afflicted with leprosy, raise the dead, cast out demons; you received without payment; give without pay.
\v 9 Do not acquire gold or silver or bronze for your belts.
\v 10 Do not take any extra money, nor two tunics, nor sandals, nor a staff; for the worker is worthy of his food.
\v 11 And into whatever city or village you enter, inquire who in it is worthy, and there remain until you go out.
\v 12 As you enter the house, greet it, saying, ‘Peace be upon this house!’
\v 13 And if the house is deserving, let your peace rest upon it; but if it is not deserving, let your peace return to you.
\v 14 And whoever does not receive you or listen to your words, as you leave that house or city, shake the dust off your feet.
\v 15 Truly, I tell you, it will be more tolerable for the land of Sodom and Gomorrah on the day of judgment than for that city.
\v 16 Behold, I am sending you out as sheep in the midst of wolves; therefore be as wise as serpents and innocent as doves.
\v 17 Beware of people, for they will hand you over to councils, and in their synagogues, they will whip you.
\v 18 And you will be brought before governors and kings because of me, to testify to them and to the nations.
\v 19 But when they deliver you over, do not be anxious about how or what you are to say; for it will be given to you in that hour what you are to say.
\v 20 For it is not you who will be speaking, but the Spirit of your Father speaking through you.
\v 21 Brother will betray brother to the point of death, and a father will hand over his child; children will rise up against their parents and put them to death.
\v 22 And you will be hated by all for my name’s sake; but the one who endures to the end will be saved.
\v 23 When they persecute you in this city, flee to another; for truly, I say to you, you will not finish going through the cities of Israel before the Son of Man comes.
\v 24 A disciple is not above his teacher, nor is a servant above his master.
\v 25 It is enough for the disciple to become like his teacher, and the servant like his master. If they have called the master of the house Beelzebul, how much more will they malign those of his household?
\v 26 So have no fear of them, for nothing is covered that will not be revealed, and nothing is hidden that will not be made known.
\v 27 What I tell you in the dark, speak in the light; and what you hear whispered, proclaim from the rooftops.
\v 28 And do not be afraid of those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul. Rather, fear him who is able to destroy both soul and body in hell.
\v 29 Are not two sparrows sold for a penny? Yet not one of them will fall to the ground apart from your Father.
\v 30 And even the very hairs on your head are all counted.
\v 31 So do not be afraid; you are worth more than many sparrows.
\v 32 Therefore, everyone who confesses me before men, I will also confess him before my Father who is in heaven.
\v 33 But whoever denies me before others, I will also deny him before my Father who is in heaven.
\v 34 Do not think that I came to bring peace to the earth; I did not come to bring peace, but a sword.
\v 35 For I have come to set a man against his father, a daughter against her mother, and a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law.
\v 36 And a man's foes will be those of his own household.
\v 37 Whoever loves father or mother more than me is not worthy of me, and whoever loves son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me.
\v 38 And whoever does not take up his cross and follow me is not worthy of me.
\v 39 Whoever finds his life will lose it, and whoever loses his life for my sake will find it.
\v 40 The one who welcomes you welcomes me, and the one who welcomes me welcomes the one who sent me.
\v 41 Whoever welcomes a prophet because he is a prophet will receive a prophet's reward, and whoever welcomes a righteous person because he is righteous will receive a righteous person's reward.
\v 42 And whoever gives even a cup of cold water to one of these little ones because he is my disciple, truly I say to you, he will not lose his reward.
\c 11
\p
\v 1 Now it came to pass, when Jesus had finished instructing His twelve disciples, that He departed from there to teach and to proclaim in their cities.
\v 2 Now when John the Baptist heard in prison about the works of the Christ, he sent two of his disciples.
\v 3 He asked His disciples, 'Are You the One who is to come, or should we expect someone else?'
\v 4 And Jesus answered them, 'Go and report to John what you hear and see:'
\v 5 The blind receive their sight, the lame walk, lepers are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead are raised, and the poor have the good news proclaimed to them.
\v 6 And blessed is the one who does not take offense at me.
\v 7 As these men were leaving, Jesus began to speak to the crowds about John: "What did you go out into the wilderness to see? A reed swaying in the wind?
\v 8 But what did you go out to see? A man clothed in fine garments? Look, those who wear fine clothes are found in royal palaces.
\v 9 But what did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes, I tell you, and even more than a prophet.
\v 10 For this is the one about whom it is written: 'Behold, I send my messenger before your face, who will prepare your way before you.'
\v 11 Truly, I say to you, among those born of women there has not arisen anyone greater than John the Baptist; yet the least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he.
\v 12 From the days of John the Baptist until now, the kingdom of heaven has been forcefully advancing, and the passionate take hold of it.
\v 13 For all the prophets and the Law prophesied until John.
\v 14 And if you are willing to accept it, he is the Elijah who was to come.
\v 15 Whoever is able to hear, let them listen attentively.
\v 16 But to what shall I compare this generation? It is like children sitting in the marketplaces and calling out to their companions,
\v 17 We played a joyful tune for you, but you did not dance; we sang a lament, but you did not mourn.
\v 18 For John came neither eating nor drinking, and they say, 'He has a demon.'
\v 19 The Son of Man came eating and drinking, and they say, 'Look, a glutton and a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and sinners.' Yet wisdom is vindicated by her children.
\v 20 Then He began to rebuke the cities where most of His mighty works had been done, because they did not repent.
\v 21 Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! For if the mighty works that were done in you had been performed in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago, sitting in sackcloth and ashes.
\v 22 But I say to you, it will be more bearable for Tyre and Sidon on the day of judgment than for you.
\v 23 And you, Capernaum, will you be lifted up to the heavens? You will be brought down to the realm of the dead; for if the miraculous works that were performed in you had been done in Sodom, it would have remained until this day.
\v 24 But I tell you that it will be more bearable for the land of Sodom on the day of judgment than for you.
\v 25 At that time, Jesus declared, ‘I thank you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that you have hidden these things from the wise and intelligent, and have revealed them to little children;’
\v 26 Yes, Father, for it was your good pleasure to do it this way.
\v 27 All things have been entrusted to me by my Father. No one knows the Son except the Father, and no one knows the Father except the Son and those to whom the Son chooses to reveal him.
\v 28 Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest.
\v 29 Take my yoke upon you, and learn from me, for I am gentle and humble in heart, and you will find rest for your souls.
\v 30 For my yoke is kind, and my burden is light.
\c 12
\p
\v 1 At that time, Jesus went through the grain fields on the Sabbath, and His disciples were hungry, and began to pluck heads of grain and eat them.
\v 2 But when the Pharisees saw it, they said to Him, "Look, Your disciples are doing what is not lawful to do on the Sabbath."
\v 3 But He said to them, 'Have you not read what David did when he was hungry, he and those who were with him?'
\v 4 How he entered the house of God and ate the showbread, which was not lawful for him to eat nor for those who were with him, except for the priests alone.
\v 5 Or have you not read in the Law that on the Sabbath the priests in the temple profane the Sabbath and are blameless?
\v 6 But I tell you that something greater than the temple is here.
\v 7 If you had understood what this means, 'I desire mercy, not sacrifice,' you would not have condemned the innocent.
\v 8 For the Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath.
\v 9 And moving on from there, He entered their synagogue.
\v 10 And behold, there was a man there with a withered hand. And they asked Him, saying, 'Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath?'—that they might accuse Him.
\v 11 But He said to them, 'Which of you, having a single sheep, if it falls into a pit on the Sabbath, will not lay hold of it and lift it out?'
\v 12 How much more valuable is a man than a sheep? Therefore, it is lawful to do good on the Sabbath.
\v 13 Then He said to the man, "Stretch out your hand." And he stretched it out, and it was restored to health, as healthy as the other.
\v 14 But the Pharisees went out and conspired against Him, how they might destroy Him.
\v 15 But Jesus, aware of this, withdrew from there. Many crowds followed Him, and He healed them all.
\v 16 And He sternly instructed them not to make Him known.
\v 17 This was to fulfill what was spoken through the prophet Isaiah, saying:
\v 18 Behold, My Servant whom I have chosen, My Beloved in whom My soul delights. I will put My Spirit upon Him, and He will proclaim justice to the nations.
\v 19 He will not quarrel or cry out, nor will anyone hear His voice in the streets.
\v 20 A bruised reed He will not break, and a smoldering wick He will not extinguish, until He leads justice to victory.
\v 21 And in His name, the nations will place their hope.
\v 22 Then a demon-possessed man who was blind and mute was brought to Him, and He healed him, so that the blind and mute man spoke and saw.
\v 23 And all the crowds were astonished and said, "Could this be the Christ, the Son of David?"
\v 24 But when the Pharisees heard this, they said, "This man does not cast out demons except by Beelzebul, the ruler of the demons."
\v 25 But knowing their thoughts, Jesus said to them, "Every kingdom divided against itself will be brought to desolation, and every city or house divided against itself will not stand."
\v 26 And if Satan drives out Satan, he is divided against himself; how then will his kingdom stand?
\v 27 And if I cast out demons by Beelzebul, by whom do your sons cast them out? Therefore, they will be your judges.
\v 28 But if I drive out demons by the Spirit of God, then the Kingdom of God has truly arrived among you.
\v 29 Or how can someone enter the strong man’s house and carry off his possessions unless he first binds the strong man? Then he can plunder his house.
\v 30 Anyone who is not with me stands against me, and anyone who does not gather with me scatters.
\v 31 Therefore I say to you, every sin and blasphemy will be forgiven people, but the blasphemy against the Spirit will not be forgiven.
\v 32 And whoever speaks a word against the Son of Man will be forgiven; but whoever speaks against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven, either in this age or in the age to come.
\v 33 Either make the tree good, and its fruit good, or make the tree bad, and its fruit bad; for a tree is known by its fruit.
\v 34 Brood of vipers, how can you, being evil, speak good things? For out of the abundance of the heart, the mouth speaks.
\v 35 A good person brings forth good things from the good treasure of his heart, while an evil person brings forth evil things from the evil treasure.
\v 36 But I say to you that every idle word that people speak, they will give an account for it on the day of judgment.
\v 37 For by your words you will be justified, and by your words you will be condemned.
\v 38 Then some of the scribes and Pharisees answered Him, saying, 'Teacher, we wish to see a sign from You.'
\v 39 But He answered and said to them, 'A wicked and adulterous generation seeks after a sign, and no sign will be given to it except the sign of Jonah the prophet.'
\v 40 For just as Jonah was in the belly of the great fish for three days and three nights, so will the Son of Man be in the heart of the earth for three days and three nights.
\v 41 The men of Nineveh will rise in judgment against this generation and will condemn it, for they repented at the preaching of Jonah; and behold, something greater than Jonah is here.
\v 42 The queen of the South will rise up at the judgment with this generation and condemn it, for she traveled from the farthest parts of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and behold, something greater than Solomon is here.
\v 43 When the unclean spirit has gone out of a person, it wanders through waterless places, seeking rest, but it finds none.
\v 44 Then it says, ‘I will return to my house from which I came.’ And when it arrives, it finds the place empty, swept, and beautifully adorned.
\v 45 Then it goes and takes with it seven other spirits more wicked than itself, and they enter in and dwell there; and the last state of that man becomes worse than the first. So it will be with this wicked generation.
\v 46 While He was still speaking to the crowds, behold, His mother and His brothers stood outside, seeking to speak with Him.
\v 47 And someone said to Him, "Look, Your mother and Your brothers are standing outside, seeking to speak with You."
\v 48 But He answered the one who told Him, 'Who is My mother, and who are My brothers?'
\v 49 And stretching out His hand toward His disciples, He said, 'Here are My mother and My brothers.'
\v 50 For whoever does the will of my Father who is in heaven, he is my brother, and sister, and mother.
\c 13
\p
\v 1 On that same day, Jesus went out of the house and sat by the sea.
\v 2 And great crowds gathered around Him, so that He got into a boat and sat down, while all the people stood on the shore.
\v 3 And He spoke to them many things in parables, saying: "Behold, a sower went out to sow."
\v 4 And as he sowed, some seeds fell along the roadside, and the birds came and devoured them.
\v 5 Other seeds fell on rocky ground, where there was not much soil, and they sprang up quickly because they had no depth of earth.
\v 6 But when the sun rose, they were scorched; and because they had no root, they withered away.
\v 7 Others fell upon the thorns, and the thorns grew up and choked them.
\v 8 But others fell on the good soil and yielded fruit: some a hundredfold, some sixty, and some thirty.
\v 9 Whoever possesses ears to hear, let him listen attentively.
\v 10 And the disciples approached Him, asking, 'Why do You speak to them in parables?'
\v 11 He answered them, 'To you it has been granted to understand the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, but to them it has not been granted.'
\v 12 For to the one who has, more will be given, and he will have an abundance; but from the one who does not have, even what he thinks he has will be taken away.
\v 13 Therefore, I speak to them in parables, because seeing they do not see, and hearing they do not hear, nor do they understand.
\v 14 In this way, the prophecy of Isaiah is fulfilled, which says: ‘You will listen and listen, yet will not comprehend; you will look and look, yet will not see.’
\v 15 For the heart of this people has grown callous, and their ears are hard of hearing, and they have closed their eyes; otherwise, they might see with their eyes and hear with their ears and understand with their heart and turn, and I would heal them.
\v 16 But blessed are your eyes, for they see, and your ears, for they hear.
\v 17 Truly, I say to you, many prophets and righteous people longed to see what you see, and did not see it, and to hear what you hear, and did not hear it.
\v 18 Therefore, hear the meaning of the parable of the sower.
\v 19 When anyone hears the message of the kingdom and does not grasp it, the evil one comes and snatches away what was sown in his heart. This is the seed sown along the path.
\v 20 But the one sown on rocky ground is the one who hears the word and immediately receives it with joy.
\v 21 But he has no root in himself; he is temporary. And when tribulation or persecution arises because of the word, he is immediately offended.
\v 22 But the one sown among thorns, this is he who hears the word; and the cares of this age and the deceitfulness of riches choke the word, and he becomes unfruitful.
\v 23 But he who was sown on good soil, this is he who hears the word and understands it; who indeed bears fruit and produces, one a hundredfold, another sixty, and another thirty.
\v 24 Another parable He put before them, saying: ‘The Kingdom of Heaven is like a man who sowed good seed in his field.’
\v 25 But while everyone was sleeping, his enemy came and sowed weeds among the wheat, and went away.
\v 26 When the wheat sprouted and produced grain, then the weeds also appeared.
\v 27 Then the servants of the master came and said to him, ‘Sir, did you not sow good seed in your field? Where then did these weeds come from?’
\v 28 But he said to them, ‘An enemy has done this.’ The servants then said to him, ‘Do you want us to go and gather them up?'
\v 29 But he said, ‘No, lest in gathering the weeds you uproot the wheat along with them.'
\v 30 Let both grow together until the harvest, and at the time of the harvest, I will say to the reapers: ‘First gather the weeds and bind them in bundles to be burned, but gather the wheat into my barn.'
\v 31 He presented to them another parable, saying: ‘The kingdom of heaven is like a mustard seed, which a man took and sowed in his field;'
\v 32 which is the smallest of all seeds; but when it has grown, it is larger than all the garden plants and becomes a tree, so that the birds of the air come and make nests in its branches.
\v 33 He spoke another parable to them: "The Kingdom of Heaven is like yeast that a woman took and hid in three measures of flour, until it was all leavened."
\v 34 All these things Jesus spoke to the crowds in parables; and without a parable He did not speak to them.
\v 35 so that what was spoken through the prophet might be fulfilled, saying: 'I will open my mouth in parables; I will proclaim things hidden since the foundation of the world.'
\v 36 Then, leaving the crowds, He went into the house. And His disciples approached Him, saying, "Please explain to us the parable of the tares of the field."
\v 37 He answered and said to them, 'The one who sows the good seed is the Son of Man.'
\v 38 The field is the world; the good seed are the children of the kingdom, but the tares are the children of the wicked one.
\v 39 The enemy who sowed them is the devil; the harvest is the end of the age, and the reapers are angels.
\v 40 Just as the weeds are gathered and burned with fire, so it will be at the end of this age.
\v 41 The Son of Man will send out His angels, and they will gather out of His kingdom all causes of sin and all lawbreakers.
\v 42 And they will throw them into the fiery furnace; there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.
\v 43 Then the righteous will shine like the sun in the kingdom of their Father. He who has ears, let him hear.
\v 44 Again, the Kingdom of Heaven is like a treasure hidden in a field, which a man found and hid; and for joy over it, he goes and sells all that he has and buys that field.
\v 45 Again, the Kingdom of Heaven is like a merchant seeking beautiful pearls.
\v 46 Who, upon finding one priceless pearl, went away and sold all that he had to purchase it.
\v 47 Again, the Kingdom of Heaven is like a net that was thrown into the sea and gathered fish of every kind.
\v 48 When it was full, the fishermen brought it ashore; sitting down, they collected the good fish into containers, but threw away the bad.
\v 49 So it will be at the end of the age: the angels will come forth and separate the wicked from among the righteous.
\v 50 And they will throw them into the fiery furnace; there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.
\v 51 Jesus said to them, "Have you understood all these things?" They answered Him, "Yes, Lord."
\v 52 And He said to them, "Therefore, every scribe instructed concerning the kingdom of heaven is like a householder who brings out of his treasure things new and old."
\v 53 And it came to pass, when Jesus had finished these parables, that He departed from there.
\v 54 And coming to His own hometown, He taught them in their synagogue, so that they were astonished and said, Where did this man get this wisdom and these miraculous powers?
\v 55 Isn't this the son of the carpenter? Isn't His mother called Mary, and aren't His brothers James, Joseph, Simon, and Judas?
\v 56 And are not all His sisters here with us? Where then did this man get all these things?
\v 57 And they took offense at Him. But Jesus said to them, 'A prophet is not without honor except in his own country and in his own house.'
\v 58 And He did not perform many miracles there because of their unbelief.
\c 14
\p
\v 1 At that time, Herod the tetrarch heard reports about Jesus.
\v 2 And he said to his servants, "This is John the Baptist; he has risen from the dead, and that is why miraculous powers are at work in him."
\v 3 For Herod had arrested John and bound him in prison because of Herodias, his brother Philip's wife.
\v 4 For John had been telling him, 'It is not lawful for you to have her.'
\v 5 And although he wanted to put him to death, he feared the crowd, because they regarded him as a prophet.
\v 6 But when Herod's birthday was celebrated, the daughter of Herodias danced before them and pleased Herod.
\v 7 So he solemnly swore to her, 'Whatever you ask of me, I will give it to you, up to half my kingdom.'
\v 8 But she, having been urged on by her mother, said, 'Give me here on a platter the head of John the Baptist.'
\v 9 And the king was distressed; but because of his oaths and those who reclined at the table with him, he commanded that it be given to her.
\v 10 So he sent and had John beheaded in the prison.
\v 11 And his head was brought on a platter and given to the girl, who presented it to her mother.
\v 12 And his disciples came and took the body and buried it, and they went and told Jesus.
\v 13 When Jesus heard about it, He withdrew from there by boat to a desolate place by Himself. But when the crowds heard of it, they followed Him on foot from the cities.
\v 14 And when Jesus went out, He saw a great multitude, and He was filled with pity for them and healed their sick.
\v 15 As evening approached, His disciples came to Him, saying, 'This place is desolate, and the hour is already late; send the crowds away, that they may go into the villages and buy food for themselves.'
\v 16 But Jesus said to them, 'They do not need to go away; you give them something to eat.'
\v 17 They replied to Him, 'We have here only five loaves and two fish.'
\v 18 He said, 'Bring them here to me.'
\v 19 And he commanded the crowds to sit down on the grass. Taking the five loaves and the two fish, he looked up to heaven and blessed them; and breaking the loaves, he gave them to the disciples, and the disciples gave them to the crowds.
\v 20 And they all ate and were filled, and they took up the leftovers of the broken pieces, twelve full baskets.
\v 21 And those who ate were about five thousand men, besides women and children.
\v 22 And immediately, Jesus compelled His disciples to get into the boat and go ahead of Him to the other side, while He dismissed the crowds.
\v 23 After He had sent the crowds away, He went up on the mountain by Himself to pray. When evening came, He was there alone.
\v 24 But the boat was already in the midst of the sea, troubled by the waves; for the wind was contrary.
\v 25 Now in the fourth watch of the night, Jesus went to them, walking on the sea.
\v 26 And when the disciples saw Him walking on the sea, they were troubled, saying, 'It is a ghost!' And from fear, they cried out.
\v 27 But immediately Jesus spoke to them, saying, 'Take courage! It is I; do not be afraid.'
\v 28 And Peter answered him, "Lord, if it is you, command me to come to you on the waters."
\v 29 He said, "Come." And stepping down from the boat, Peter walked on the water to go to Jesus.
\v 30 But when he saw the strong wind, he was afraid; and beginning to sink, he cried out, 'Lord, save me!'
\v 31 Immediately, Jesus stretched out His hand and caught him, saying, 'O you of little faith! Why did you doubt?'
\v 32 And when they entered the boat, the wind ceased.
\v 33 Then those who were in the boat came and worshiped Him, saying, 'Truly, You are the Son of God.'
\v 34 After they had crossed over, they arrived at the land of Gennesaret.
\v 35 And when the men of that place recognized Him, they sent word throughout the whole region, and they brought to Him all who were afflicted.
\v 36 And they implored Him that they might only touch the fringe of His garment. And as many as touched it were made perfectly whole.
\c 15
\p
\v 1 Then the scribes and Pharisees who were from Jerusalem came to Jesus, saying:
\v 2 Why do Your disciples break the tradition of the elders? For they do not wash their hands when they eat bread.
\v 3 But He answered them, "And why do you also transgress the commandment of God because of your tradition?
\v 4 For God commanded, saying, 'Honor your father and your mother'; and, 'He who speaks evil of father or mother, let him be put to death.'
\v 5 But you say, 'Whoever says to his father or mother, "Whatever help you might have received from me is a gift," does not honor his father or mother.'
\v 6 Thus, you have nullified the command of God for the sake of your tradition.
\v 7 Hypocrites! Isaiah prophesied well about you, saying:
\v 8 This people draws near to me with their mouths and honors me with their lips, but their hearts are far removed from me.
\v 9 But in vain do they worship Me, teaching as doctrines the commandments of men.
\v 10 And having summoned the crowd, He said to them, "Listen and understand."
\v 11 It is not what enters the mouth that defiles a person, but what comes out of the mouth; this is what defiles a person.
\v 12 Then His disciples approached Him and said, 'Do You realize that the Pharisees were offended when they heard this saying?'
\v 13 But He answered and said, 'Every plant that My heavenly Father has not planted will be uprooted.'
\v 14 Leave them alone; they are blind leaders of the blind. And if a blind man leads a blind man, both will fall into a pit.
\v 15 Peter replied, "Please explain this parable to us."
\v 16 But Jesus said, "Are you still so simple-minded?"
\v 17 Do you not yet understand that whatever enters the mouth goes into the stomach and is eliminated?
\v 18 But what comes out of the mouth proceeds from the heart, and this is what defiles a person.
\v 19 For out of the heart come evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, sexual immoralities, thefts, false testimonies, and blasphemies.
\v 20 These are the things that defile a person; but to eat with unwashed hands does not defile him.
\v 21 And Jesus departed from there and withdrew to the regions of Tyre and Sidon.
\v 22 And behold, a Canaanite woman from those regions came out and cried out to him, saying, "Have mercy on me, Lord, Son of David; my daughter is severely tormented by a demon."
\v 23 But He did not answer her a word. And His disciples came and urged Him, saying, "Send her away, for she cries out after us."
\v 24 But He answered and said, "I was sent only to the lost sheep of the house of Israel."
\v 25 But she came and knelt before Him, saying, "Lord, help me!"
\v 26 But He answered, "It is not good to take the children's bread and throw it to the little dogs."
\v 27 But she said, 'Yes, Lord; even the little dogs eat the crumbs that fall from their masters' table.'
\v 28 Then Jesus answered her, 'O woman, great is your faith! Let it be done for you as you desire.' And her daughter was healed from that very hour.
\v 29 And moving on from there, Jesus came by the Sea of Galilee, and after going up onto the mountain, He sat down there.
\v 30 And great crowds came to Him, bringing with them the lame, the blind, the mute, the crippled, and many others; and they laid them down at Jesus’ feet, and He healed them.
\v 31 So that the crowds marveled, seeing the mute speaking, the crippled healthy, the lame walking, and the blind seeing; and they glorified the God of Israel.
\v 32 Then Jesus called His disciples to Him and said, 'I feel deep compassion for this crowd, for they have been with Me for three days and have nothing to eat. I do not want to send them away hungry, lest they faint on the journey.'
\v 33 And His disciples said to Him, 'Where could we find enough bread in this wilderness to satisfy such a great crowd?'
\v 34 And Jesus said to them, 'How many loaves do you have?' They replied, 'Seven, and a few small fish.'
\v 35 And He commanded the crowds to sit down on the ground.
\v 36 And taking the seven loaves and the fish, He gave thanks, broke them, and gave them to His disciples, and the disciples distributed them to the crowds.
\v 37 And they all ate and were filled, and they took up the leftover fragments, seven baskets full.
\v 38 Now those who ate were four thousand men, besides women and children.
\v 39 And after sending the crowds away, He got into the boat and went to the region of Magdala.
\c 16
\p
\v 1 And the Pharisees and Sadducees came to Him, testing Him, and asked Him to show them a sign from heaven.
\v 2 But He answered them, 'When evening comes, you say, 'It will be fair weather, for the sky is red.'
\v 3 And in the morning, you say, 'Today will be stormy, for the sky is gloomy.' You know how to interpret the appearance of the sky, but you cannot discern the signs of the times.
\v 4 A wicked and adulterous generation seeks for a sign, but no sign will be given to it, except for the sign of Jonah the prophet." And He left them and departed.
\v 5 And when His disciples came to the other side, they had forgotten to bring bread.
\v 6 But Jesus said to them, "Take heed and beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees."
\v 7 But they were reasoning among themselves, saying, "It is because we brought no bread."
\v 8 But Jesus, aware of this, said to them, "Why are you discussing among yourselves about having no bread, O you of little faith?"
\v 9 Do you not yet understand or remember the five loaves of the five thousand, and how many baskets you took up?
\v 10 Nor the seven loaves from the four thousand, and how many baskets you gathered?
\v 11 How do you not understand that I was not speaking about bread? But beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees.
\v 12 Then they understood that He was not warning them to beware of the leaven of bread, but of the teachings of the Pharisees and Sadducees.
\v 13 When Jesus came into the region of Caesarea Philippi, He asked His disciples, 'Who do people say that the Son of Man is?'
\v 14 And they said, 'Some say John the Baptist, others say Elijah, and still others say Jeremiah or one of the prophets.'
\v 15 But what about you? Who do you say I am?
\v 16 Simon Peter replied, 'You are the Messiah, the Son of the Living God.'
\v 17 And Jesus answered him, 'Blessed are you, Simon Bar-Jonah, for flesh and blood has not revealed this to you, but my Father who is in heaven.'
\v 18 And I tell you that you are Peter, and on this rock, I will build my church, and the gates of hell will not prevail against it.
\v 19 And I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven; whatever you bind on earth shall be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.
\v 20 Then He commanded His disciples not to tell anyone that He was the Christ.
\v 21 From that time onward, Jesus began to reveal to His disciples that He must go to Jerusalem and suffer many things from the elders, chief priests, and scribes, and be killed, and on the third day rise again.
\v 22 And Peter took Him aside and began to sharply rebuke Him, saying, "God forbid, Lord; this shall never happen to You!"
\v 23 But He turned and said to Peter, "Get behind Me, Satan! You are an offense to Me, for you are not mindful of the things of God, but the things of men."
\v 24 Then Jesus said to His disciples, "If anyone wants to follow Me, let him deny himself, take up his cross, and follow Me."
\v 25 For whoever desires to save his life will lose it; but whoever loses his life for my sake will find it.
\v 26 For what will it profit a man if he gains the whole world but loses his own soul? Or what will a man give in exchange for his soul?
\v 27 For the Son of Man is about to come in the glory of His Father, accompanied by His angels, and then He will reward each person according to their deeds.
\v 28 Truly, I say to you, there are some standing here who will not taste death until they see the Son of Man coming in His kingdom.
\c 17
\p
\v 1 After six days, Jesus took Peter, James, and John, his brother, and led them up a high mountain by themselves.
\v 2 And He was transfigured before them; His face shone like the sun, and His garments became as white as light.
\v 3 And behold, Moses and Elijah appeared to them, conversing with Him.
\v 4 Responding, Peter said to Jesus, 'Lord, it is good for us to be here. If you wish, I will set up three shelters here—one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah.'
\v 5 While he was still speaking, a bright cloud overshadowed them, and behold, a voice out of the cloud said, 'This is my beloved Son, in whom I take delight; listen to him!'
\v 6 And when the disciples heard this, they fell on their faces and were greatly afraid.
\v 7 And Jesus came and touched them, saying, "Rise, and do not be afraid."
\v 8 And when they lifted up their eyes, they saw no one except Jesus alone.
\v 9 And as they were coming down from the mountain, Jesus commanded them, saying, "Tell no one about the vision until the Son of Man is raised from the dead."
\v 10 And the disciples asked him, saying, "Why then do the scribes say that Elijah must come first?"
\v 11 But Jesus answered them, 'Indeed, Elijah is coming first and will restore all things.'
\v 12 But I tell you, Elijah has already come, and they did not recognize him, but did to him whatever they wished. In the same way, the Son of Man is going to suffer at their hands.
\v 13 Then the disciples understood that He was speaking to them about John the Baptist.
\v 14 And when they approached the crowd, a man came and knelt before Him, saying,
\v 15 Lord, have mercy on my son, for he is epileptic and suffers severely; for he often falls into the fire and often into the water.
\v 16 I brought him to Your disciples, but they were unable to heal him.
\v 17 Jesus replied, 'O unbelieving and perverse generation! How long must I be with you? How long must I put up with you? Bring the boy here to Me.'
\v 18 And Jesus rebuked him, and the demon came out of him, and the boy was healed from that very hour.
\v 19 Then the disciples approached Jesus privately and asked, 'Why were we unable to cast it out?'
\v 20 Jesus replied, 'It is because of your lack of faith. Truly I tell you, if you have faith as small as a mustard seed, you can say to this mountain, “Move from here to there,” and it will move; nothing will be impossible for you.'
\v 21 However, this kind does not go out except by prayer and fasting.
\v 22 As they were gathering in Galilee, Jesus said to them, 'The Son of Man is about to be handed over into the hands of men.'
\v 23 and they will kill him, and on the third day he will be raised up.' And they were greatly distressed.
\v 24 When they arrived in Capernaum, those who collected the temple tax approached Peter and asked, 'Does your teacher not pay the temple tax?'
\v 25 He said, 'Yes.' And when he entered the house, Jesus anticipated him, saying, 'What do you think, Simon? From whom do the kings of the earth take tolls or taxes? From their own sons or from others?'
\v 26 Peter replied, 'From others.' Jesus said to him, 'Then the sons are free.'
\v 27 But to avoid causing offense to them, go to the sea, cast a hook, and take the first fish that comes up. When you open its mouth, you will find a coin; take that and give it to them for me and you.
\c 18
\p
\v 1 At that time, the disciples approached Jesus and asked, 'Who then is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven?'
\v 2 And Jesus called a child to Him and set him in the midst of them.
\v 3 Truly, I say to you, unless you turn and become like little children, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven.
\v 4 Therefore, whoever humbles himself like this child is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven.
\v 5 And whoever receives a child like this in my name welcomes me.
\v 6 But whoever causes one of these little ones who believe in me to stumble, it would be better for him to have a heavy millstone hung around his neck and to be drowned in the depths of the sea.
\v 7 Woe to the world because of stumbling blocks! For it is necessary that stumbling blocks come; but woe to the person through whom the stumbling block comes!
\v 8 And if your hand or your foot causes you to stumble, cut it off and throw it away from you. It is better for you to enter life crippled or lame than to have two hands or two feet and be thrown into the eternal fire.
\v 9 And if your eye causes you to stumble, tear it out and throw it away. It is better for you to enter into life with one eye than to have two eyes and be thrown into the fiery hell.
\v 10 Take heed that you do not despise one of these little ones; for I tell you that their angels in heaven always behold the face of my Father who is in heaven.
\v 11 For the Son of Man has come to seek and save that which was lost.
\v 12 What do you think? If a man has a hundred sheep and one of them goes astray, will he not leave the ninety-nine on the mountains and go in search of the one that went astray?
\v 13 And if he finds it, truly I say to you, he rejoices over it more than over the ninety-nine that did not go astray.
\v 14 In the same way, it is not the will of your Father who is in heaven that one of these little ones should perish.
\v 15 If your brother sins against you, go and tell him his fault, between you and him alone; if he listens to you, you have gained your brother.
\v 16 But if he does not listen, take one or two others along with you, that every word may be confirmed by the testimony of two or three witnesses.
\v 17 If he refuses to listen to them, tell it to the church; and if he refuses to listen even to the church, let him be to you as a Gentile and a tax collector.
\v 18 Truly, I say to you, whatever you bind on earth shall be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.
\v 19 Again, I tell you, if two of you agree on earth about anything they ask, it will be done for them by my Father in heaven.
\v 20 For where two or three are gathered in my name, there am I among them.
\v 21 Then Peter came up to Him and said, 'Lord, how often shall my brother sin against me, and I forgive him? Up to seven times?'
\v 22 Jesus said to him, "I do not say to you up to seven times, but up to seventy times seven."
\v 23 Therefore, the kingdom of heaven may be compared to a king who wished to settle accounts with his servants.
\v 24 As he began to settle the accounts, one servant was brought to him who owed him ten thousand talents.
\v 25 But since he could not pay, his master commanded that he be sold, along with his wife and children, and all that he had, so that payment could be made.
\v 26 Falling on his knees, the servant implored him, saying, 'Master, be patient with me, and I will repay you everything.'
\v 27 Moved with compassion, the master of that servant released him and forgave him the debt.
\v 28 But that servant went out and found one of his fellow servants who owed him a hundred denarii; and he seized him, choking him, saying, 'Pay back what you owe!'
\v 29 So his fellow servant fell down at his feet and begged him, saying, 'Be patient with me, and I will repay you all.'
\v 30 But he refused and went away, and cast him into prison until he should pay back what was owed.
\v 31 When his fellow servants saw what had happened, they were greatly distressed and went and reported to their lord all that had taken place.
\v 32 Then his master summoned him and said to him, 'You wicked servant! I forgave you all that debt because you pleaded with me.'
\v 33 Shouldn't you have had mercy on your fellow servant, as I had mercy on you?
\v 34 And in anger, his master delivered him to the tormentors until he should repay all that was owed.
\v 35 So likewise shall my heavenly Father do to you, if each of you from your heart does not forgive his brother his trespasses.
\c 19
\p
\v 1 Now it came to pass, when Jesus had finished these sayings, He departed from Galilee and went to the borders of Judea, beyond the Jordan.
\v 2 And great crowds followed Him, and He healed them there.
\v 3 And the Pharisees approached Him, testing Him, and saying, ‘Is it permissible for a man to divorce his wife for any reason?’
\v 4 He answered them, 'Have you not read that He who created them from the beginning made them male and female,'
\v 5 And for this reason, a man shall leave his father and mother and be united with his wife, and the two shall become one flesh.
\v 6 So they are no longer two, but one flesh. Therefore, what God has joined together, let not man separate.
\v 7 They said to Him, 'Why then did Moses command to give a certificate of divorce and to send her away?'
\v 8 He said to them, 'Moses permitted you to divorce your wives because of the hardness of your hearts; but it was not so from the beginning.'
\v 9 And I say to you, whoever divorces his wife, except for the reason of sexual immorality, and marries another, commits adultery; and whoever marries a woman who has been divorced commits adultery.
\v 10 The disciples said to Him, "If such is the case of a man with his wife, it is better not to marry."
\v 11 But He said to them, 'Not everyone can accept this teaching, but only those to whom it has been given.'
\v 12 For there are eunuchs who were born so from their mother's womb, and there are eunuchs who were made eunuchs by men, and there are eunuchs who have made themselves eunuchs for the sake of the Kingdom of Heaven. He who is able to accept it, let him accept it.
\v 13 Then children were brought to Him so that He might lay His hands on them and pray; but the disciples rebuked them.
\v 14 But Jesus said, "Let the little children come to me and do not hinder them, for the kingdom of heaven belongs to such as these."
\v 15 And after laying his hands on them, he departed from there.
\v 16 And behold, one came up to Him and said, 'Good Teacher, what good deed must I do to gain eternal life?'
\v 17 But He said to him, 'Why do you call Me good? No one is good except the one, God. If you wish to enter into life, keep the commandments.'
\v 18 He said to him, 'Which ones?' Jesus replied, 'You shall not murder, you shall not commit adultery, you shall not steal, you shall not bear false witness.'
\v 19 Honor your father and mother, and you shall love your neighbor as yourself.
\v 20 The young man said to Him, "I have observed all these things from my youth. What do I still lack?"
\v 21 Jesus said to him, 'If you wish to be perfect, go, sell your possessions and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; then come, follow me.'
\v 22 But when the young man heard this statement, he went away sorrowful, for he had many possessions.
\v 23 But Jesus said to His disciples, "Truly I say to you, it is hard for a rich person to enter the kingdom of heaven."
\v 24 Again I tell you, it is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than for a rich person to enter the kingdom of God.
\v 25 When the disciples heard this, they were greatly astonished and said, "Then who can be saved?"
\v 26 But Jesus looked at them and said, "With man this is impossible, but with God, all things are possible."
\v 27 Then Peter responded and said to Him, "Look, we have left everything and followed You. What then will there be for us?"
\v 28 And Jesus said to them, "Truly I say to you, that you who have followed Me will, in the regeneration, when the Son of Man sits on His glorious throne, also sit on twelve thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel."
\v 29 And everyone who has left houses or brothers or sisters or father or mother or wife or children or fields for my name’s sake will receive a hundredfold and will inherit eternal life.
\v 30 But many who are seen as first will be last, and those who are regarded as last will be first.
\c 20
\p
\v 1 For the kingdom of heaven is like a landowner who went out early in the morning to hire laborers for his vineyard.
\v 2 And having agreed with the laborers for a denarius for the day, he sent them into his vineyard.
\v 3 And going out about the third hour, he saw others standing still in the marketplace.
\v 4 And he said to them, ‘Go you also into the vineyard, and whatever is just, I will give you.’
\v 5 They went out again. About the sixth and the ninth hour, he did the same.
\v 6 And about the eleventh hour, he went out and found others standing idle, and he said to them, 'Why have you been standing here all day long without work?'
\v 7 They replied to him, 'No one has hired us.' He said to them, 'You go into the vineyard too, and whatever is fair, you shall receive.'
\v 8 When evening came, the owner of the vineyard said to his steward, ‘Call the laborers and give them their wages, starting from the last to the first.’
\v 9 And those who came about the eleventh hour received a denarius each.
\v 10 But when the first came, they assumed they would receive more, yet they also received each a denarius.
\v 11 And upon receiving their payment, they began to grumble against the master of the house.
\v 12 saying, ‘These last worked only one hour, and you have made them equal to us, who have borne the burden of the day and the scorching heat.’
\v 13 But he answered one of them, 'Friend, I am not being unjust to you; did we not agree on a denarius?'
\v 14 Take what is yours and go. I choose to give this last one the same as I give you.
\v 15 Is it not permissible for me to do what I wish with what belongs to me? Or is your eye envious because I am good?
\v 16 Thus, the last will be first, and the first will be last; for many are called, but few are chosen.
\v 17 As Jesus was ascending to Jerusalem, He took the twelve disciples aside privately along the way and said to them:
\v 18 Behold, we are going up to Jerusalem, and the Son of Man will be handed over to the chief priests and the scribes, and they will condemn Him to death.
\v 19 and they will hand Him over to the Gentiles to be mocked and scourged and crucified, and on the third day He will rise again.
\v 20 Then the mother of the sons of Zebedee approached Him, bowing down and asking Him for something.
\v 21 And He said to her, 'What do you wish?' She said to Him, 'Grant that these two sons of mine may sit, one on Your right hand and the other on Your left, in Your kingdom.'
\v 22 But Jesus answered and said, 'You do not know what you are asking. Are you able to drink the cup that I am about to drink, or be baptized with the baptism with which I am to be baptized?' They said to Him, 'We are able.'
\v 23 He said to them, 'You will indeed drink from my cup, and be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with; but to sit at my right hand and at my left is not mine to grant, but is for those for whom it has been prepared by my Father.'
\v 24 And when the ten heard it, they became indignant about the two brothers.
\v 25 But Jesus called them to Himself and said, 'You know that the rulers of the Gentiles exercise dominion over them, and their great ones wield authority over them.'
\v 26 It shall not be this way among you; rather, whoever wishes to be great among you must be your servant.
\v 27 And whoever wishes to be first among you shall be your servant.
\v 28 Just as the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give His life as a ransom for many.
\v 29 As they were leaving Jericho, a large crowd followed Him.
\v 30 And behold, two blind men were sitting by the roadside, and when they heard that Jesus was passing by, they cried out, saying, ‘Lord, Son of David, have mercy on us!'
\v 31 But the crowd rebuked them, telling them to be quiet; yet they shouted all the more, ‘Lord, Son of David, have mercy on us!'
\v 32 And Jesus stood still and called them, saying, 'What do you want Me to do for you?'
\v 33 They said to Him, 'Lord, let our eyes be opened.'
\v 34 Moved with compassion, Jesus touched their eyes; immediately their sight was restored, and they followed Him.
\c 21
\p
\v 1 And as they drew near to Jerusalem, and came to Bethphage at the Mount of Olives, then Jesus sent two of His disciples.
\v 2 saying to them, 'Go into the village that is opposite you, and immediately you will find a donkey tied, and a colt with her; untie them and bring them to Me.
\v 3 And if anyone says anything to you, you shall say, 'The Lord has need of them'; and immediately he will send them.
\v 4 This all happened so that what was spoken through the prophet might be fulfilled.
\v 5 Say to the daughter of Zion, ‘Behold, your king is coming to you, gentle and riding on a donkey, on a colt, the foal of a donkey.’
\v 6 The disciples went and did as Jesus instructed them.
\v 7 They brought the donkey and the colt to Jesus and laid their garments on them, and he sat upon them.
\v 8 And the most part of the crowd spread their cloaks on the road, while others cut branches from the trees and spread them along the way.
\v 9 The crowds that went ahead of him and those that followed shouted, 'Hosanna to the Son of David! Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord! Hosanna in the highest!'
\v 10 And when he entered Jerusalem, the whole city was stirred, asking, 'Who is this?'
\v 11 And the crowds were saying, 'This is Jesus, the prophet from Nazareth of Galilee.'
\v 12 And Jesus entered the temple of God and drove out all who were selling and buying in the temple, and He overturned the tables of the money changers and the seats of those selling doves.
\v 13 And He said to them, 'It is written, My house shall be called a house of prayer; but you have made it a den of robbers.'
\v 14 And the blind and the lame came to Him in the temple, and He healed them.
\v 15 But when the chief priests and the scribes saw the wonderful things that He did, and the children shouting in the temple and saying, 'Hosanna to the Son of David!' they were indignant.
\v 16 And they said to Him, 'Do You hear what these are saying?' And Jesus said to them, 'Yes, have you never read, ‘Out of the mouths of infants and nursing babies You have prepared praise’?
\v 17 And leaving them, He went out of the city to Bethany and spent the night there.
\v 18 Early in the morning, as He was returning to the city, He became hungry.
\v 19 And seeing a fig tree by the road, He approached it, but found nothing on it except leaves. And He said to it, 'May you never bear fruit again!' Immediately, the fig tree withered away.
\v 20 And when the disciples saw it, they marveled, saying, 'How did the fig tree wither away so soon?'
\v 21 But Jesus answered them, 'Truly, I tell you, if you have faith and do not doubt, you will not only do what was done to the fig tree, but even if you say to this mountain, ‘Be taken up and thrown into the sea,’ it will happen.
\v 22 And whatever you ask in prayer, believing, you will receive.
\v 23 And when He entered the temple, the chief priests and the elders of the people came to Him as He was teaching, and said, "By what authority are You doing these things? And who gave You this authority?"
\v 24 Jesus answered them, 'I will ask you one question; if you answer me, I will tell you by what authority I do these things.'
\v 25 The baptism of John—was it from heaven or from men?" They deliberated among themselves, saying, 'If we say, 'From heaven,' He will ask us, 'Why then did you not believe him?'
\v 26 But if we say, 'From men,' we fear the crowd, for they all regard John as a prophet.
\v 27 And they answered Jesus, 'We do not know.' He said to them, 'Neither will I tell you by what authority I do these things.'
\v 28 But what do you think? A man had two sons, and he went to the first and said, 'Son, go work today in my vineyard.'
\v 29 He answered, 'I will not,' but later he changed his mind and went.
\v 30 And coming to the second, he said the same thing. The son replied, ‘I will, sir,’ but he did not go.
\v 31 Which of the two did the will of his father? They said, 'The first.' Jesus said to them, 'Truly, I say to you, that the tax collectors and the prostitutes are entering the kingdom of God before you.'
\v 32 For John came to you in the way of righteousness, and you did not believe him; but the tax collectors and the prostitutes believed him, and even when you saw it, you did not afterward change your minds and believe him.
\v 33 Listen to another parable: There was a master of a house who planted a vineyard, put a fence around it, dug a winepress in it, and built a tower. Then he leased it to tenants and went away.
\v 34 When the time for the harvest drew near, he sent his servants to the tenants to collect his fruit.
\v 35 And the farmers took his servants; they beat one, killed another, and stoned a third.
\v 36 Again he sent more servants than the first; and they did the same to them.
\v 37 Later, he sent his son to them, saying, 'They will surely respect my son.'
\v 38 But when the farmers saw the son, they said to one another, 'This is the heir; come, let us kill him and seize his inheritance.'
\v 39 And they took him, threw him out of the vineyard, and killed him.
\v 40 When therefore the lord of the vineyard comes, what will he do to those tenants?
\v 41 They said to Him, 'He will bring those wretches to a miserable end, and lease the vineyard to other farmers who will give Him the fruits in their seasons.'
\v 42 Jesus said to them, 'Have you never read in the Scriptures: The stone which the builders rejected has become the cornerstone? This was the Lord's doing, and it is marvelous in our eyes?'
\v 43 Therefore, I say to you that the kingdom of God will be taken from you and given to a nation producing its fruits.
\v 44 And he who falls on this stone will be broken; but on whomever it falls, it will crush him.
\v 45 And when the chief priests and the Pharisees heard His parables, they understood that He was speaking about them.
\v 46 And they sought to seize Him, but feared the crowds, because they regarded Him as a prophet.
\c 22
\p
\v 1 And Jesus answered and spoke to them again in parables, saying:
\v 2 The kingdom of heaven is like a king who prepared a wedding feast for his son.
\v 3 And he sent his servants to call those who had been invited to the wedding feast, but they were not willing to come.
\v 4 Again he sent other servants, saying, ‘Tell those who have been invited, Behold, I have prepared my banquet; my oxen and fatted calves are killed, and all things are ready. Come to the wedding feast.'
\v 5 But they paid no attention and went away, one to his own field, another to his business.
\v 6 But the rest seized his servants, insulted them, and killed them.
\v 7 But when the king heard about it, he was enraged, and he sent his armies to destroy those murderers and to set their city on fire.
\v 8 Then he said to his servants, 'The wedding feast is ready, but those who were invited were not worthy.'
\v 9 Go therefore to the intersections of the roads, and invite as many as you find to the wedding feast.
\v 10 And those servants went out into the streets and gathered all whom they found, both bad and good; and the wedding hall was filled with guests.
\v 11 But when the king came in to see the guests, he noticed there a man who was not wearing wedding clothes.
\v 12 And he said to him, ‘Friend, how did you get in here without wedding clothes?’ And the man was speechless.
\v 13 Then the king said to the servants, ‘Bind his feet and hands, take him away, and throw him into the outer darkness; in that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.’
\v 14 For many are invited, but few are chosen.
\v 15 Then the Pharisees went and plotted how they might entangle Him in His words.
\v 16 And they sent their disciples to Him, along with the Herodians, saying, "Teacher, we know that You are truthful and teach the way of God in truth, and You do not care about anyone’s opinion, for You do not judge by outward appearances."
\v 17 So tell us, what do You think? Is it lawful to give a tribute to Caesar or not?
\v 18 But Jesus, knowing their malice, said, "Why do you test me, you hypocrites?"
\v 19 Show Me the coin used for the tax.' And they brought Him a denarius.
\v 20 And He asked them, 'Whose likeness and inscription is this?'
\v 21 They said to Him, 'Caesar's.' And He replied to them, 'Therefore render to Caesar what belongs to Caesar, and to God what belongs to God.'
\v 22 And when they heard this, they were astonished; and leaving Him, they went away.
\v 23 On that day, the Sadducees approached Him, those who say there is no resurrection, and they questioned Him.
\v 24 saying, "Teacher, Moses said that if a man dies without having children, his brother must marry the widow and raise up offspring for his brother."
\v 25 Now there were seven brothers with us. The first married and died, and having no offspring, he left his wife to his brother.
\v 26 In the same way, the second and the third, until all seven had married her.
\v 27 Finally, after them all, the woman also died.
\v 28 In the resurrection, whose wife will the woman be? For all seven had her as a wife.
\v 29 Jesus answered and said to them, "You are mistaken, not knowing the Scriptures nor the power of God."
\v 30 For in the resurrection, they neither marry nor are given in marriage, but are like angels of God in heaven.
\v 31 But concerning the resurrection of the dead, have you not read what was spoken to you by God, saying,
\v 32 ‘I am the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.’ He is not the God of the dead, but of the living.
\v 33 And when the crowds heard this, they were filled with wonder at his teaching.
\v 34 But when the Pharisees heard that He had silenced the Sadducees, they gathered together in one place.
\v 35 And one of them, an expert in the law, approached Him, testing Him and saying.
\v 36 Teacher, which commandment is the greatest in the Law?
\v 37 Jesus said to him, ‘You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your mind.’
\v 38 This is the first and greatest commandment.
\v 39 And a second is like it: You shall love your neighbor as yourself.
\v 40 On these two commandments depend all the Law and the Prophets.
\v 41 While the Pharisees were gathered together, Jesus asked them a question.
\v 42 He asked them, 'What do you think about the Christ? Whose son is he?' They said to him, 'The son of David.'
\v 43 He said to them, 'How then does David, by the Spirit, call him Lord, saying,
\v 44 The Lord said to my Lord, 'Sit at my right hand until I make your enemies a footstool for your feet.'
\v 45 If, then, David calls Him Lord, how can He be his son?
\v 46 And no one was able to answer Him a word, nor did anyone dare to question Him anymore from that day forward.
\c 23
\p
\v 1 Then Jesus spoke to the crowds and to His disciples.
\v 2 saying, 'The scribes and the Pharisees have taken their seat in the seat of Moses.'
\v 3 Therefore, all that they tell you to observe, you must keep and do; but do not follow their actions, for they say and do not practice.
\v 4 For they bind heavy and unbearable burdens and lay them on the shoulders of men, but they themselves do not lift a finger to move them.
\v 5 But all their works they do to be seen by men. They broaden their phylacteries and lengthen the tassels of their garments.
\v 6 They love the places of honor at feasts and the best seats in the synagogues.
\v 7 and they love greetings in the marketplaces and to be called 'Rabbi' by others.
\v 8 But you are not to be called 'Rabbi,' for you have one Teacher, the Christ; and all of you are brothers.
\v 9 And do not call anyone on earth your father, for you have one Father, who is in heaven.
\v 10 And do not be called teachers, for you have one Teacher, the Christ.
\v 11 But the greatest among you shall be your servant.
\v 12 Whoever exalts himself will be humbled, and whoever humbles himself will be exalted.
\v 13 Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you devour the houses of widows, and for a show make long prayers. Therefore, you will receive the greater judgment.
\v 14 Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you shut the kingdom of heaven in front of men; for you do not enter yourselves, nor do you allow those who are entering to go in.
\v 15 Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you traverse land and sea to make one proselyte, and when he is made, you make him twice as much a son of hell as yourselves.
\v 16 Woe to you, blind guides! For you say, 'Whoever swears by the temple, it is nothing; but whoever swears by the gold of the temple is obligated.'
\v 17 Foolish and blind! Which is greater, the gold or the temple that sanctifies the gold?
\v 18 And whoever swears by the altar, it means nothing; but whoever swears by the gift that is upon it, is bound by his oath.
\v 19 You foolish and blind! For which is greater, the gift or the altar that sanctifies the gift?
\v 20 Therefore, the one who swears by the altar swears by it and by everything upon it.
\v 21 And he who swears by the temple swears by it and by Him who dwells in it.
\v 22 And he who swears by heaven swears by the throne of God and by Him who sits upon it.
\v 23 Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you meticulously tithe mint, dill, and cumin, but you have overlooked the weightier matters of the law: justice, mercy, and faith. It is these you ought to have practiced, without neglecting the others.
\v 24 Blind guides! You strain out a gnat but swallow a camel!
\v 25 Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you clean the outside of the cup and the plate, but inside they are full of extortion and injustice.
\v 26 You blind Pharisee! First cleanse the inside of the cup and the dish, so that the outside may also become clean.
\v 27 Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you are like whitewashed tombs, which indeed appear beautiful outwardly, but inside are full of dead bones and all uncleanness.
\v 28 So you also outwardly appear righteous to others, but within you are full of hypocrisy and lawlessness.
\v 29 Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you build the tombs of the prophets and decorate the monuments of the righteous.
\v 30 And you say, 'If we had lived in the days of our ancestors, we would not have taken part with them in shedding the blood of the prophets.'
\v 31 Thus, you testify against yourselves that you are the descendants of those who murdered the prophets.
\v 32 And so you have filled up the measure of your forefathers.
\v 33 Serpents, offspring of vipers! How will you escape the judgment of hell?
\v 34 Therefore, behold, I send you prophets and wise men and scribes; some of them you will kill and crucify, and some of them you will scourge in your synagogues and persecute from city to city.
\v 35 so that upon you may come all the righteous blood shed on the earth, from the blood of righteous Abel to the blood of Zechariah son of Barachiah, whom you murdered between the sanctuary and the altar.
\v 36 Truly, I say to you, all these things will come upon this generation.
\v 37 O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, you who kill the prophets and stone those sent to you! How often I longed to gather your children together, as a hen gathers her chicks under her wings, but you were not willing!
\v 38 Behold, your house is left to you desolate.
\v 39 For I tell you, you will not see me again until you say, 'Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.'
\c 24
\p
\v 1 As Jesus left the temple, his disciples came to him to point out the magnificent buildings of the temple.
\v 2 But Jesus said to them, "Do you not see all these things? Truly I say to you, there will not be left here one stone upon another that will not be thrown down."
\v 3 As He sat on the Mount of Olives, the disciples came to Him privately, saying, 'Tell us, when will these things happen, and what will be the sign of Your coming and of the end of the age?'
\v 4 And Jesus answered and said to them, 'Take care that no one leads you astray.'
\v 5 For many will come in my name, claiming, ‘I am the Christ,’ and will deceive many.
\v 6 And you will hear of wars and reports of wars. See that you are not troubled, for these things must happen, but the end is not yet.
\v 7 For nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom, and there will be famines and pestilences and earthquakes in various places.
\v 8 All these are just the beginning of birth pains.
\v 9 Then they will hand you over to be afflicted and will kill you, and you will be hated by all nations because of my name.
\v 10 At that time many will stumble and will betray one another and will hate one another.
\v 11 And many false prophets will arise and will deceive many.
\v 12 And because lawlessness will abound, the love of many will grow cold.
\v 13 But the one who perseveres to the end will be saved.
\v 14 And this gospel of the Kingdom will be proclaimed throughout the whole world as a testimony to all nations, and then the end will come.
\v 15 So when you see the abomination of desolation spoken of by the prophet Daniel standing in the holy place—let the one who reads understand—
\v 16 Then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains.
\v 17 Let the one who is on the housetop not go down to take anything out of his house.
\v 18 And let the one who is in the field not turn back to take his cloak.
\v 19 But woe to those who are pregnant and to those who are nursing infants in those days.
\v 20 Pray that your escape may not occur in winter or on the Sabbath.
\v 21 For then there will be great tribulation, such as has not occurred since the beginning of the world until now, nor ever will be.
\v 22 And unless those days are shortened, no flesh would be saved; but for the sake of the elect, those days will be cut short.
\v 23 Then if anyone says to you, ‘Look, here is the Christ!’ or ‘There He is!’ do not believe them.
\v 24 For false Christs and false prophets will arise, and they will perform great signs and wonders, so as to lead astray, if possible, even the chosen ones.
\v 25 Behold, I have warned you in advance.
\v 26 So if they say to you, 'Look, He is in the wilderness,' do not go out; or, 'Look, He is in the inner rooms,' do not believe it.
\v 27 For as lightning comes from the east and flashes to the west, so will be the coming of the Son of Man.
\v 28 For wherever the corpse may be, there will the eagles be gathered together.
\v 29 Immediately after the tribulation of those days, the sun will be darkened, and the moon will not give its light; the stars will fall from the heavens, and the powers of the heavens will be shaken.
\v 30 And then the sign of the Son of Man will appear in heaven, and all the tribes of the earth will mourn; and they will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of heaven with great power and glory.
\v 31 And He will send out His angels with a loud trumpet call, and they will gather His elect from the four winds, from one end of heaven to the other.
\v 32 Now learn this lesson from the fig tree: When its branch becomes tender and its leaves sprout, you know that summer is near.
\v 33 So, when you see all these things, understand that He is near, right at the door.
\v 34 Truly, I say to you, this generation will not pass away until all these things take place.
\v 35 Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will never pass away.
\v 36 But concerning that day and hour, no one knows, neither the angels in heaven nor the Son, but only my Father alone.
\v 37 But just as the days of Noah were, so will be the coming of the Son of Man.
\v 38 For just as they were in the days before the flood, eating and drinking, marrying and being given in marriage, until the day Noah entered the ark,
\v 39 And they did not know until the flood came and swept them all away, so will be the coming of the Son of Man.
\v 40 Then two will be in the field; one will be taken, and one will be left.
\v 41 Two women will be grinding at the mill; one will be taken, and one will be left.
\v 42 Therefore, stay alert, for you do not know at what hour your Lord is coming.
\v 43 But this you must understand, that if the householder had known at what time the thief was coming, he would have stayed awake and not allowed his house to be broken into.
\v 44 Therefore, you also must be prepared, for at an hour you do not expect, the Son of Man will come.
\v 45 Who then is the faithful and wise servant, whom his master has set over his household, to give them their food at the proper time?
\v 46 Blessed is that servant whom his master finds doing so when he arrives.
\v 47 Truly, I tell you, he will put him in charge of all his belongings.
\v 48 But if that wicked servant says in his heart, ‘My master is delaying his coming,’
\v 49 and begins to beat his fellow servants, and to eat and drink with the drunken.
\v 50 The master of that servant will come on a day when he does not expect him, and at an hour he does not know.
\v 51 And he will cut him in two, and appoint him a portion with the hypocrites; there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.
\c 25
\p
\v 1 Then the kingdom of heaven will be like ten virgins who took their lamps and went out to meet the bridegroom.
\v 2 Five of them were wise, and five were foolish.
\v 3 The foolish ones took their lamps but did not take any oil with them.
\v 4 But the wise took oil in jars along with their lamps.
\v 5 As the bridegroom delayed, all the virgins became drowsy and fell asleep.
\v 6 But at midnight, a shout was heard: 'Behold, the bridegroom is coming; go out to meet him!'
\v 7 Then all those virgins arose and trimmed their lamps.
\v 8 And the foolish said to the wise, 'Give us some of your oil, for our lamps are going out.'
\v 9 But the wise answered, saying, 'Perhaps there will not be enough for us and for you; rather, go to those who sell and buy for yourselves.'
\v 10 But while they were gone to buy oil, the bridegroom arrived. The prepared ones went in with him to the wedding feast, and the door was shut.
\v 11 Later, the other virgins came and said, 'Lord, Lord, open the door for us!'
\v 12 But he answered, 'Truly I say to you, I do not know you.'
\v 13 Therefore, stay alert, for you do not know the day or the hour when the Son of Man will come.
\v 14 For it will be like a man going on a journey, who called his own servants and entrusted to them his possessions.
\v 15 To one he gave five talents, to another two, and to another one, each according to his own ability; and then he went away immediately.
\v 16 Then he who had received the five talents went and traded with them, and made five more talents.
\v 17 Likewise, the one who had received two talents gained two more.
\v 18 But the one who had received the single talent went away, dug a hole in the ground, and hid his master's money.
\v 19 After a long time, the master of those servants returned and settled accounts with them.
\v 20 And he who had received the five talents approached, bringing five talents more, saying, 'Master, you entrusted me with five talents; see, I have gained five more talents on top of them.'
\v 21 His master said to him, 'Well done, good and faithful servant! You were faithful over a little; I will set you over much. Enter into the joy of your lord.'
\v 22 And he who had received the two talents came forward, saying, 'Master, you entrusted me with two talents; behold, I have gained two more talents beside them.'
\v 23 His master said to him, ‘Well done, good and faithful servant! You have been faithful over a few things; I will set you over many things. Enter into the joy of your master.’
\v 24 Then he who had received the one talent came forward and said, 'Master, I knew you to be a hard man, reaping where you did not sow and gathering where you scattered no seed.'
\v 25 And filled with fear, I went away and hid your talent in the ground; look, here you have what is yours.
\v 26 But his master answered him, ‘You wicked and slothful servant! You knew that I reap where I have not sown and gather where I have not scattered seed!'
\v 27 Then you ought to have deposited my money with the bankers, and at my coming, I would have received it back with interest.
\v 28 Therefore take the talent from him and give it to the one who has the ten talents.
\v 29 For to everyone who has, more will be given, and he will have an abundance; but from the one who does not have, even what he thinks he possesses will be taken away from him.
\v 30 And cast out the worthless servant into the outer darkness; there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.
\v 31 When the Son of Man comes in His glory, and all the holy angels with Him, then He will sit on His glorious throne.
\v 32 And before Him will be gathered all the nations, and He will separate them one from another, just as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats.
\v 33 And He will place the sheep on His right hand, but the goats on His left.
\v 34 Then the King will say to those on His right, ‘Come, you blessed of My Father; inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world.
\v 35 For I was hungry, and you gave Me food; I was thirsty, and you gave Me drink; I was a stranger, and you took Me in.
\v 36 I was naked, and you clothed me; I was sick, and you visited me; I was in prison, and you came to me.
\v 37 Then the righteous will answer him, saying, 'Lord, when did we see you hungry and feed you, or thirsty and give you something to drink?'
\v 38 When did we see you as a stranger and offer you a welcome, or naked and clothe you?
\v 39 When did we see you ill or imprisoned, and come to you?
\v 40 And the King will answer them, 'Truly, I say to you, as you did it to one of the least of these my brothers, you did it to me.'
\v 41 Then he will say to those on his left, 'Depart from me, you cursed ones, into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels.'
\v 42 For I was hungry, and you did not give me anything to eat; I was thirsty, and you did not give me anything to drink.
\v 43 I was a stranger, and you did not welcome me; I was naked, and you did not clothe me; I was sick and in prison, and you did not visit me.
\v 44 Then they will also answer Him, saying, 'Lord, when did we see You hungry or thirsty, or a stranger, or naked, or sick, or in prison, and did not minister to You?'
\v 45 Then He will respond to them, saying, 'Truly I say to you, as much as you did not do it for one of the least of these, you did not do it for Me.'
\v 46 And these will go away into eternal punishment, but the righteous into eternal life.
\c 26
\p
\v 1 When Jesus had completed all these teachings, he said to his disciples,
\v 2 You know that after two days, the Passover is coming, and the Son of Man will be handed over to be crucified.
\v 3 Then the chief priests, the scribes, and the elders of the people gathered together in the courtyard of the high priest, who was called Caiaphas.
\v 4 And they conspired together to seize Jesus by deceit and to put Him to death.
\v 5 But they said, 'Not during the festival, lest there be an uproar among the people.'
\v 6 Now Jesus was in Bethany, at the house of Simon the leper.
\v 7 A woman approached Him, carrying an alabaster jar filled with very costly perfume, and she poured it upon His head while He was reclining.
\v 8 But when His disciples saw it, they were greatly displeased, saying, 'Why this waste?'
\v 9 For this fragrant oil could have been sold for a great price and the money given to the poor.
\v 10 But Jesus, aware of this, said to them, "Why do you trouble the woman? For she has done a beautiful deed for Me.
\v 11 For you will always have the poor among you, but you will not always have Me.
\v 12 For when she poured this ointment on My body, she did it to prepare Me for burial.
\v 13 Truly, I say to you, wherever this gospel is preached throughout the whole world, what she has done will also be told in remembrance of her.
\v 14 Then one of the twelve, named Judas Iscariot, went to the chief priests and said to them,
\v 15 What will you give me if I hand him over to you? And they counted out to him thirty pieces of silver.
\v 16 And from that time, he sought an opportunity to hand him over.
\v 17 On the first day of the Feast of Unleavened Bread, the disciples came to Jesus, asking, 'Where do You want us to prepare for You to eat the Passover?'
\v 18 But He said, 'Go into the city to a certain man and tell him, 'The Teacher says, My time is near; I will celebrate the Passover at your house with My disciples.'
\v 19 And the disciples did as Jesus had instructed them, and they made ready the Passover.
\v 20 Now when evening had come, He reclined at the table with the twelve.
\v 21 And as they were eating, He said, "Truly I say to you, that one of you will betray Me."
\v 22 And they were greatly distressed, and began to say to Him, each one of them, 'Is it I, Lord?'
\v 23 But He answered, 'The one who has dipped his hand with Me in the dish, he will betray Me.'
\v 24 The Son of Man is going away as it has been written concerning Him. But woe to that man by whom the Son of Man is betrayed! It would have been better for that man if he had never been born.
\v 25 Judas, the one betraying Him, replied, 'Surely, it is not I, Rabbi?' Jesus said to him, 'You have said it yourself.'
\v 26 While they were eating, Jesus took bread, and after giving thanks, He broke it and gave it to His disciples, saying, 'Take and eat; this is my body.'
\v 27 And he took the cup, and after giving thanks, he gave it to them, saying, 'Drink from it, all of you.'
\v 28 For this is my blood of the new covenant, which is poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins.
\v 29 But I tell you, I will not drink from this fruit of the vine from now until that day when I drink it anew with you in my Father’s kingdom.
\v 30 And after singing a hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives.
\v 31 Then Jesus said to them, "All of you will fall away because of Me this night; for it is written: 'I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock will be scattered.'"
\v 32 But after I have been raised, I will go ahead of you to Galilee.
\v 33 Peter replied, "Even if all others stumble because of you, I will never stumble."
\v 34 Jesus said to him, 'Truly, I say to you, this very night, before the rooster crows, you will deny me three times.'
\v 35 Peter replied to him, 'Even if I must die with you, I will never deny you.' And all the disciples said the same.
\v 36 Then Jesus went with them to a place called Gethsemane, and he said to his disciples, 'Sit here while I go over there and pray.'
\v 37 And taking with Him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, He began to be overwhelmed with sorrow and deep anguish.
\v 38 Then Jesus said to them, 'My soul is filled with grief to the point of death. Remain here and stay awake with me.'
\v 39 And going a little farther, He fell on His face and prayed, saying, 'My Father, if it is possible, let this cup pass from me; yet not as I will, but as You will.'
\v 40 And He came to the disciples and found them sleeping; and He said to Peter, 'So, could you not watch with Me for one hour?'
\v 41 Stay alert and pray, so that you do not fall into temptation; the spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak.
\v 42 Again, He went away a second time and prayed, saying, 'My Father, if this cup cannot pass from Me unless I drink it, let Your will be done.'
\v 43 And coming back, He found them again sleeping; for their eyes were heavy.
\v 44 And leaving them, He went away again and prayed the same words a third time.
\v 45 Then He came to His disciples and said to them, "Sleep on now and take your rest! Behold, the hour is at hand, and the Son of Man is being delivered into the hands of sinners."
\v 46 Rise, let us be going; look, my betrayer is near.
\v 47 While he was still speaking, behold, Judas, one of the twelve, arrived; and with him was a great crowd armed with swords and clubs, sent by the chief priests and the elders of the people.
\v 48 Now the betrayer had given them a sign, saying, 'The one whom I kiss is the one; seize him.'
\v 49 And immediately approaching Jesus, he said, 'Greetings, Rabbi,' and kissed Him.
\v 50 But Jesus said to him, 'Friend, why have you come?' Then they came forward, laid hands on Jesus, and arrested Him.
\v 51 And behold, one of those who were with Jesus stretched out his hand and drew his sword, and striking the servant of the high priest, he cut off his ear.
\v 52 Then Jesus said to him, 'Put your sword back in its place, for all who take the sword will perish by the sword.'
\v 53 Or do you think that I cannot presently appeal to my Father, and he would at once provide me with more than twelve legions of angels?
\v 54 How then will the Scriptures be fulfilled, that it must happen this way?
\v 55 At that hour, Jesus said to the crowds, 'Have you come out to seize me as you would a bandit, with swords and clubs? Every day I sat teaching in the temple, and you did not arrest me.
\v 56 But all this has taken place so that the writings of the prophets may be fulfilled. Then all the disciples forsook Him and fled.
\v 57 Those who had seized Jesus led Him away to Caiaphas the high priest, where the scribes and the elders had gathered.
\v 58 But Peter followed Him at a distance, right up to the courtyard of the high priest, and entering in, he sat down among the servants to see the outcome.
\v 59 Now the chief priests, the elders, and the entire council were seeking false testimony against Jesus in order to put Him to death.
\v 60 But they found none; and although many false witnesses came forward, they found none. At last, two false witnesses came forward.
\v 61 This man said, 'I am able to destroy the temple of God and rebuild it in three days.'
\v 62 And the high priest arose and said to Him, 'Do You answer nothing? What is it that these men testify against You?'
\v 63 But Jesus remained silent. And the high priest answered and said to Him, 'I put you under oath by the living God: Tell us if you are the Christ, the Son of God.'
\v 64 Jesus said to him, 'You have said so. But I tell you, from now on you will see the Son of Man seated at the right hand of the Power and coming on the clouds of heaven.'
\v 65 Then the high priest tore his robes, saying, 'He has spoken blasphemy! What further need do we have of witnesses? Behold, now you have heard His blasphemy!'
\v 66 What do you think?' They answered, 'He is guilty of death.'
\v 67 Then they spat in his face and struck him; and some slapped him.
\v 68 saying, "Prophesy to us, O Christ! Who is it that struck you?"
\v 69 Now Peter was sitting outside in the courtyard. And a servant girl came up to him and said, "You also were with Jesus of Galilee."
\v 70 But he denied it in front of them all, saying, "I do not know what you are talking about."
\v 71 When he had gone out to the gateway, another servant girl saw him and said to those nearby, "This man was with Jesus of Nazareth."
\v 72 And again he denied it with an oath, saying, "I do not know the man."
\v 73 After a little while, those who stood by approached Peter and said, 'Surely you are one of them; for your speech gives you away.'
\v 74 Then he began to call down curses and swore an oath, saying, 'I do not know the man!' And immediately, a rooster crowed.
\v 75 And Peter remembered the saying of Jesus, which had been spoken to him, 'Before the rooster crows, you will deny me three times.' And going outside, he wept with deep sorrow.

\v 1 As morning dawned, all the chief priests and the elders of the people took counsel against Jesus to put Him to death.
\v 2 And after binding Him, they led Him away and handed Him over to Pontius Pilate, the governor.
\v 3 Then Judas, who had betrayed Him, seeing that He was condemned, felt remorse and returned the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and the elders.
\v 4 saying, 'I have sinned, betraying innocent blood.' And they said, 'What is that to us? You will see to it.'
\v 5 And throwing down the silver coins in the temple, he went away; and having departed, he hanged himself.
\v 6 But the chief priests took the silver coins and said, 'It is not lawful to put these into the treasury, since it is the price of blood.'
\v 7 And after taking counsel, they purchased the potter's field with those funds, to serve as a burial place for foreigners.
\v 8 Therefore, that field was called the Field of Blood, a name it still bears to this day.
\v 9 Then what was spoken through the prophet Jeremiah was fulfilled, saying: 'And they took the thirty pieces of silver, the price of Him who was valued, whom they of the children of Israel valued.'
\v 10 And they gave the thirty pieces of silver to the potter's field, as the Lord had commanded me.
\v 11 Meanwhile, Jesus stood before the governor, and the governor questioned Him, saying, 'Are you the king of the Jews?' Jesus answered him, 'You say so.'
\v 12 And when He was being accused by the chief priests and the elders, He gave no answer.
\v 13 Then Pilate said to Him, "Do you not hear how many things they testify against you?"
\v 14 And He did not respond to him with even a single word, so that the governor was greatly amazed.
\v 15 Now at the feast, the governor was accustomed to release one prisoner to the crowd, whom they wanted.
\v 16 And they had then a notorious prisoner named Barabbas.
\v 17 So when they had gathered together, Pilate said to them, 'Whom do you want me to release to you? Barabbas or Jesus, who is called the Christ?'
\v 18 For he knew that it was out of envy that they had handed Him over.
\v 19 While he was sitting on the judgment seat, his wife sent him a message saying, 'Have nothing to do with that righteous man, for I have suffered much today in a dream because of him.'
\v 20 But the chief priests and the elders persuaded the crowds to ask for Barabbas and to have Jesus put to death.
\v 21 The governor answered and said to them, 'Which of the two do you wish me to release to you?' They said, 'Barabbas.'
\v 22 Pilate said to them, 'What then shall I do with Jesus who is called Christ?' They all answered, 'Let Him be crucified!'
\v 23 But the governor said, 'What evil has He done?' And they cried out all the more, 'Let Him be crucified!'
\v 24 When Pilate saw that he was getting nowhere, but instead a tumult was arising, he took water and washed his hands before the crowd, saying, ‘I am innocent of the blood of this righteous man. You will see to it.’
\v 25 And all the people answered, ‘His blood be on us and on our children.’
\v 26 Then he released to them Barabbas; but after having Jesus scourged, he delivered Him up to be crucified.
\v 27 Then the soldiers of the governor took Jesus into the praetorium and gathered the whole battalion against Him.
\v 28 And stripping Him of His garments, they dressed Him in a scarlet robe.
\v 29 And they wove a crown from thorns and placed it upon His head, and they put a reed in His right hand. Then, kneeling before Him, they mocked Him, saying, 'Hail, King of the Jews!'
\v 30 And they spat on Him, and taking the reed, they struck Him on the head.
\v 31 And when they had mocked Him, they stripped Him of the robe and put His own clothes back on Him, and led Him away to be crucified.
\v 32 As they were going out, they found a man of Cyrene, named Simon; they forced him to carry His cross.
\v 33 And when they came to a place called Golgotha, which means 'the place of a skull,' they prepared for the execution.
\v 34 They gave Him vinegar mixed with gall to drink; but when He tasted it, He would not drink.
\v 35 And after they had crucified Him, they divided His garments among themselves, casting lots for them.
\v 36 And sitting down, they kept watch over Him there.
\v 37 And they placed above His head the charge against Him, which was written: This is Jesus, the King of the Jews.
\v 38 Then two thieves were crucified with Him, one on the right and one on the left.
\v 39 And those who passed by reviled Him, shaking their heads at Him.
\v 40 And saying, 'You who are destroying the temple and rebuilding it in three days! Save Yourself; if You are the Son of God, come down from the cross!'
\v 41 In the same way, the chief priests, along with the scribes and elders, mocked Him, saying,
\v 42 He has saved others; He cannot save Himself. If He is the King of Israel, let Him come down now from the cross, and we will believe in Him.
\v 43 He trusts in God; let God rescue Him now, if He desires Him; for He said, 'I am the Son of God.'
\v 44 The same thing happened with the robbers who were crucified with Him; they also cast insults at Him.
\v 45 Now from the sixth hour, darkness fell over all the land until the ninth hour.
\v 46 About the ninth hour, Jesus cried out with a loud voice, saying, "My God, my God, why have you abandoned me?"
\v 47 Some of those standing there, upon hearing it, said, 'This man is calling for Elijah!'
\v 48 And immediately, one of those standing there ran and took a sponge, filled it with sour wine, and put it on a reed to give Him a drink.
\v 49 But the others said, 'Let us see if Elijah comes to save him.'
\v 50 But Jesus, once more crying out with a loud voice, yielded up His spirit.
\v 51 And behold, the curtain of the temple was torn in two from top to bottom; and the earth shook, and the rocks were split.
\v 52 And the tombs were opened, and many bodies of the holy ones who had fallen asleep were raised.
\v 53 And coming out of the tombs after His resurrection, they entered the holy city and appeared to many.
\v 54 But the centurion and those who were with him, watching over Jesus, when they saw the earthquake and all that had happened, were filled with great fear, saying, 'Truly, this was the Son of God!'
\v 55 And there were many women there, observing from a distance, who had followed Jesus from Galilee, serving Him.
\v 56 Among them was Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James and Joseph, and the mother of the sons of Zebedee.
\v 57 As evening approached, a wealthy man named Joseph, who was from Arimathea, came to take the body of Jesus. He was also a disciple of Jesus.
\v 58 This man went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus.
\v 59 And taking the body, Joseph wrapped it in a clean linen cloth.
\v 60 and laid it in his own new tomb, which he had hewn out of the rock. And he rolled a great stone to the entrance of the tomb and went away.
\v 61 And there were Mary Magdalene and the other Mary sitting opposite the tomb.
\v 62 The next day, which is after the Preparation, the chief priests and the Pharisees gathered together before Pilate.
\v 63 saying, 'Sir, we remember that deceiver said, while He was still alive, ‘After three days I will rise.’
\v 64 Therefore, command that the tomb be made secure until the third day, lest His disciples come by night and steal Him away, and say to the people, ‘He has risen from the dead,’ and the last deception will be worse than the first.
\v 65 Pilate said to them, "You have a guard. Go, make it as secure as you know how."
\v 66 So they went and made the tomb secure, sealing the stone and setting a guard.
\c 28
\p
\v 1 Now after the Sabbath, as the first light of the week dawned, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary came to observe the tomb.
\v 2 And behold, there was a great earthquake; for an angel of the Lord descended from heaven, rolled back the stone from the entrance, and sat upon it.
\v 3 His appearance was like lightning, and his clothing was white as snow.
\v 4 And because of their fear, the guards trembled and became as if they were dead.
\v 5 But the angel answered and said to the women, "Do not be afraid; for I know that you seek Jesus who was crucified."
\v 6 He is not here; for He has risen, just as He said. Come, see the place where the Lord lay.
\v 7 And go quickly and tell His disciples that He has risen from the dead; and behold, He goes before you into Galilee; there you will see Him. Behold, I have told you.
\v 8 And they quickly left the tomb with a mixture of fear and great joy, and ran to tell His disciples.
\v 9 As they went to bring the news to His disciples, behold, Jesus met them, saying, 'Rejoice!' And they came and held His feet, and worshipped Him.
\v 10 Then Jesus said to them, 'Do not be afraid; go and tell my brothers to go to Galilee; there they will see me.'
\v 11 As they were on their way, some of the guard went into the city and reported to the chief priests all that had taken place.
\v 12 And when they had gathered together with the elders and taken counsel, they gave a sufficient amount of silver to the soldiers, saying,
\v 13 Say that His disciples came at night and stole Him away while we were sleeping.
\v 14 And if this comes to the governor's ears, we will persuade him and keep you free from worry.
\v 15 So they took the silver and did as they were instructed. And this report has been widely circulated among the Jews to this day.
\v 16 Then the eleven disciples went to Galilee, to the mountain where Jesus had directed them.
\v 17 When they saw him, they worshiped him; but some doubted.
\v 18 And Jesus came and spoke to them, saying, 'All authority in heaven and on earth has been granted to me.'
\v 19 Therefore, as you go, make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit,
\v 20 Teaching them to observe all that I have commanded you. And behold, I am with you all the days, until the end of the age. Amen.
