\v 1 In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.
\v 2 He was in the beginning with God.
\v 3 All things came into being through Him, and without Him not even one thing was made that has been made.
\v 4 In Him was life, and that life was the light for humanity.
\v 5 And the light shines in the darkness, and the darkness did not overpower it.
\v 6 There came a man sent from God, whose name was John.
\v 7 He came as a witness, to bear witness about the Light, so that all might believe through him.
\v 8 He was not the light, but came to bear witness concerning the light.
\v 9 The true light that gives light to everyone was coming into the world.
\v 10 He was in the world, and though the world was made through him, the world did not recognize him.
\v 11 He came to his own, and his own people did not receive him.
\v 12 But to all who received him, he gave the authority to become children of God, to those who believe in his name.
\v 13 who were not born of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God.
\v 14 And the Word became flesh and dwelt among us, and we beheld His glory, the glory as of the only begotten from the Father, full of grace and truth.
\v 15 John bore witness of Him and cried out, saying, 'This is He of whom I said, “He who comes after me has surpassed me, for He was before me.”'
\v 16 And from His fullness we have all received, and grace upon grace.
\v 17 For the law was given through Moses; grace and truth came into being through Jesus Christ.
\v 18 No one has ever seen God; the only begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, He has declared Him.
\v 19 And this is the testimony of John, when the Jews sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem to ask him, 'Who are you?'
\v 20 And he confessed, and did not deny it; but he acknowledged, 'I am not the Christ.'
\v 21 And they asked him, 'What then? Are you Elijah?' And he said, 'I am not.' 'Are you the Prophet?' And he answered, 'No.'
\v 22 So they said to him, 'Who are you? Tell us, so that we can give an answer to those who sent us. What do you say about yourself?'
\v 23 He said, 'I am the voice of one crying out in the wilderness, ‘Make straight the way of the Lord,’ as said by the prophet Isaiah.'
\v 24 And those who were sent were from the Pharisees.
\v 25 And they asked him, 'Then why are you baptizing, if you are neither the Christ, nor Elijah, nor the Prophet?'
\v 26 John answered them, saying, 'I baptize with water; but there stands among you One whom you do not know.'
\v 27 It is He who comes after me, who was before me; I am not worthy to untie the strap of His sandal.
\v 28 These things took place in Bethany beyond the Jordan, where John was baptizing.
\v 29 The next day, John saw Jesus coming toward him, and said, 'Look, the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world!'
\v 30 This is he of whom I spoke: ‘A man comes after me who has surpassed me, for he existed before me.'
\v 31 And I did not know Him, but for this reason I came baptizing with water, that He might be revealed to Israel.
\v 32 And John bore witness, saying, 'I have seen the Spirit descending from heaven like a dove, and it remained on Him.'
\v 33 And I did not know Him, but He who sent me to baptize with water said to me, 'Upon whom you see the Spirit descending and remaining on Him, this is He who baptizes with the Holy Spirit.'
\v 34 And I have seen and have borne witness that this is the Son of God.
\v 35 The next day, John was standing again with two of his disciples.
\v 36 And he looked at Jesus as He walked by and said, "Behold, the Lamb of God!"
\v 37 The two disciples heard him speaking, and they followed Jesus.
\v 38 But Jesus turned and, seeing them following, said to them, 'What do you seek?'
\v 39 He said to them, 'What are you seeking?' They said to Him, 'Rabbi (which means Teacher), where are you staying?'
\v 40 He said to them, 'Come and see.' They went and saw where He was staying, and they remained with Him that day; it was about the tenth hour.
\v 41 He first found his own brother Simon and said to him, 'We have found the Messiah' (which is translated, the Christ).
\v 42 He found his own brother Simon and said to him, 'We have discovered the Messiah,' which is translated as 'the Christ.'
\v 43 The next day, Jesus decided to go to Galilee. He found Philip and said to him, ‘Follow me.’
\v 44 The following day, Jesus intended to go into Galilee, and He found Philip and said to him, ‘Come, be My disciple.’
\v 45 Philip was from Bethsaida, the city of Andrew and Peter.
\v 46 Philip found Nathanael and said to him, ‘We have found the one whom Moses wrote about in the Law, and whom the prophets also spoke, Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph.’
\v 47 Jesus saw Nathanael approaching and said of him, ‘Behold, an Israelite indeed, in whom there is no deceit.’
\v 48 Jesus saw Nathanael coming toward Him and said of him, 'Behold, an Israelite truly, in whom there is no guile.'
\v 49 Nathanael replied to Him, "Rabbi, you are the Son of God! You are the King of Israel!"
\v 50 Nathanael answered Him, 'Rabbi, you are the Son of God! You are the King of Israel!'
\v 51 And Jesus answered him, 'Truly, I say to you, you will see heaven opened, and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of Man.'
\c 2
\p
\v 1 On the third day, there was a wedding in Cana of Galilee, and the mother of Jesus was there.
\v 2 And Jesus and His disciples were also invited to the wedding.
\v 3 When the wine ran out, the mother of Jesus said to Him, 'They have no more wine.'
\v 4 Jesus said to her, 'What is that to you and to me, woman? My hour has not yet come.'
\v 5 His mother said to the servants, 'Whatever he tells you, do it.'
\v 6 Now there were six stone water jars there for the Jewish rites of purification, each holding twenty or thirty gallons.
\v 7 Jesus said to them, "Fill the jars with water." And they filled them to the brim.
\v 8 And he said to them, 'Draw some out now and take it to the master of the feast.' And they brought it.
\v 9 But when the head waiter tasted the water that had now become wine, and did not know where it had come from (though the servants who had drawn the water knew), he called the bridegroom.
\v 10 And he said to him, "Every man serves the good wine first, and when people have drunk freely, then the inferior. But you have kept the good wine until now."
\v 11 This, the first of His signs, Jesus performed at Cana in Galilee, and thus He manifested His glory; and His disciples believed in Him.
\v 12 After this, He went down to Capernaum with His mother, His brothers, and His disciples; and they stayed there a few days.
\v 13 The Passover of the Jews was approaching, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.
\v 14 And He found in the temple those who were selling oxen, sheep, and doves, and the money changers sitting there.
\v 15 And making a whip of cords, He drove them all out of the temple, both the sheep and the oxen; and He poured out the coins of the money changers and overturned their tables.
\v 16 And to those who were selling the pigeons He said, 'Take these things away; do not make My Father’s house a house of trade.'
\v 17 His disciples remembered that it is written, 'The zeal for Your house will consume me.'
\v 18 So the Jews answered Him, 'What sign do You show us for doing these things?'
\v 19 Jesus answered them, "Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up."
\v 20 Then the Jews said, "This temple has been under construction for forty-six years, and will you raise it up in three days?"
\v 21 But He was speaking of the temple of His body.
\v 22 Therefore, when He was raised from the dead, His disciples remembered that He had said this, and they believed the Scripture and the word which Jesus had spoken.
\v 23 Now when He was in Jerusalem at the Passover, during the feast, many believed in His name, observing the signs which He did.
\v 24 But Jesus did not entrust Himself to them, because He knew all people.
\v 25 and He did not need anyone to testify concerning man, for He Himself knew what was in man.
\c 3
\p
\v 1 Now there was a man of the Pharisees, named Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews.
\v 2 This man came to Jesus by night and said to Him, 'Rabbi, we know that You are a teacher come from God; for no one can perform the signs that You do unless God is with him.'
\v 3 Jesus answered and said to him, "Truly, truly, I say to you, unless one is born again, he cannot see the Kingdom of God."
\v 4 Nicodemus said to Him, "How can a man be born when he is old? Can he enter a second time into his mother’s womb and be born?"
\v 5 Jesus answered, "Truly, truly, I say to you, unless one is born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter the kingdom of God."
\v 6 That which is born of the flesh is flesh, and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit.
\v 7 Do not marvel that I said to you, 'You must be born from above.'
\v 8 The Spirit blows where it wishes, and you hear its sound, but you do not know where it comes from or where it goes. So it is with everyone who is born of the Spirit.
\v 9 Nicodemus answered and said to Him, "How can these things be?"
\v 10 Jesus answered and said to him, "You are the teacher of Israel, and you do not understand these things?"
\v 11 Truly, truly, I say to you, we speak of what we know and bear witness to what we have seen, yet you do not accept our testimony.
\v 12 If I have told you earthly things and you do not believe, how can you believe if I tell you heavenly things?
\v 13 And no one has ascended into heaven except the one who descended from heaven, the Son of Man who is in heaven.
\v 14 And just as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, so must the Son of Man be lifted up.
\v 15 that whoever believes in Him may not be lost, but may have everlasting life.
\v 16 For God so loved the world that He gave His one and only Son, that whoever believes in Him shall not perish but have eternal life.
\v 17 For God did not send His Son into the world to condemn the world, but to save the world through Him.
\v 18 Whoever believes in Him is not condemned; but whoever does not believe is already condemned, because he has not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God.
\v 19 And this is the judgment: the light has come into the world, but people preferred darkness over light, because their deeds were evil.
\v 20 For everyone who practices evil hates the light and does not come to the light, lest his works should be exposed.
\v 21 But the one who practices the truth comes to the light, so that his works may be clearly seen, that they have been accomplished through God.
\v 22 After this, Jesus and His disciples went into the Judean countryside, where He spent time with them and baptized.
\v 23 John was also baptizing in Aenon near Salim, because there was plenty of water there; and people were coming and being baptized.
\v 24 For John had not yet been cast into prison.
\v 25 Now a discussion arose among John's disciples with a Jew concerning the matter of purification.
\v 26 And they came to John and said to him, 'Rabbi, the one who was with you across the Jordan, whom you have testified about, behold, he is baptizing, and all are coming to him.'
\v 27 John answered and said, 'A person cannot receive even one thing unless it is given him from heaven.'
\v 28 You yourselves are witnesses that I said, ‘I am not the Christ, but I am the one sent before Him.’
\v 29 The one who has the bride is the bridegroom; but the friend who stands and hears him rejoices greatly at the bridegroom’s voice. Therefore, this joy of mine is now complete.
\v 30 He must increase, but I must decrease.
\v 31 He who comes from above is above all; he who is of the earth belongs to the earth and speaks in an earthly way; he who comes from heaven is above all.
\v 32 He bears witness to what he has seen and heard, yet no one receives his testimony.
\v 33 The one who has accepted his testimony has certified that God is true.
\v 34 For he whom God has sent speaks the words of God, for God gives the Spirit without measure.
\v 35 The Father loves the Son and has entrusted everything into his hands.
\v 36 Whoever believes in the Son has eternal life; but whoever disobeys the Son will not see life, but the wrath of God remains on him.

\p
\v 1 Now when Jesus learned that the Pharisees had heard that He was making and baptizing more disciples than John—
\v 2 Although Jesus Himself was not baptizing, it was His disciples who carried out the baptisms.
\v 3 He left Judea and went back once more to Galilee.
\v 4 But he had to pass through Samaria.
\v 5 So He came to a town of Samaria called Sychar, near the plot of ground that Jacob gave to his son Joseph.
\v 6 Now Jacob's well was there. Jesus, therefore, tired from His journey, sat thus by the well. It was about the sixth hour.
\v 7 A woman of Samaria came to draw water. Jesus said to her, "Give Me a drink."
\v 8 For His disciples had gone into the city to buy food.
\v 9 The Samaritan woman said to Him, 'How is it that you, a Jew, ask for a drink from me, a Samaritan woman?' For Jews have no dealings with Samaritans.
\v 10 Jesus answered and said to her, 'If you knew the gift of God, and who it is that says to you, “Give Me a drink,” you would have asked Him, and He would have given you living water.'
\v 11 The woman said to Him, 'Sir, You have no bucket, and the well is deep. Where then do You get that living water?'
\v 12 Are You greater than our father Jacob, who gave us the well and drank from it himself, as did his sons and his livestock?
\v 13 Jesus answered and said to her, "Everyone who drinks of this water will thirst again.
\v 14 But whoever drinks of the water that I will give him shall never thirst again; rather, the water that I give him will become in him a well of water springing up to eternal life.
\v 15 The woman said to Him, "Sir, give me this water, so that I will not thirst, nor come here to draw again."
\v 16 Jesus said to her, 'Go, call your husband and come here.'
\v 17 The woman answered him, 'I have no husband.' Jesus said to her, 'You are correct in saying, ‘I have no husband.’'
\v 18 For you have had five husbands, and the man you now have is not your husband. What you have said is true.
\v 19 The woman said to Him, 'Sir, I perceive that You are a prophet.'
\v 20 Our fathers worshiped on this mountain, but you say that in Jerusalem is the place where people ought to worship.
\v 21 Jesus said to her, 'Woman, believe Me, the time is coming when you will neither worship the Father on this mountain nor in Jerusalem.'
\v 22 You worship what you do not know; we worship what we know, for salvation is from the Jews.
\v 23 Yet the hour is coming, and now is here, when the true worshipers will worship the Father in spirit and in truth; for the Father seeks such people to be his worshipers.
\v 24 God is spirit, and those who worship him must worship in spirit and truth.
\v 25 The woman said to him, "I know that the Messiah is coming, the one called Christ. When he comes, he will declare all things to us."
\v 26 Jesus said to her, "I who speak to you am he."
\v 27 And at that moment, His disciples came, and they were amazed that He was speaking with a woman; yet no one said, "What do you seek?" or, "Why are you talking with her?"
\v 28 So the woman left her water jar and went into the city, and she said to the people:
\v 29 Come, see a man who told me everything I ever did. Could this be the Christ?
\v 30 So they left the city and began their journey toward Him.
\v 31 Meanwhile, the disciples urged Him, saying, "Rabbi, eat."
\v 32 But He said to them, 'I have food to eat that you do not know about.'
\v 33 Therefore, the disciples said to one another, 'Did someone bring Him food?'
\v 34 Jesus said to them, 'My food is to do the will of Him who sent me and to finish His work.'
\v 35 Do you not say, ‘There are still four months until the harvest’? Behold, I say to you, lift up your eyes and look at the fields, for they are already white for harvest.
\v 36 And he who reaps receives wages and gathers fruit for eternal life, so that both he who sows and he who reaps may rejoice together.
\v 37 For in this is the true saying, 'One sows and another reaps.'
\v 38 I sent you to reap what you have not labored for; others have worked hard, and you have entered into their labor.
\v 39 And many of the Samaritans from that city believed in him because of the woman's testimony, saying, "He told me everything I ever did."
\v 40 So when the Samaritans came to him, they urged him to stay with them, and he stayed there for two days.
\v 41 And many more believed because of His word.
\v 42 And they said to the woman, "Now we believe, not because of what you said; for we ourselves have heard Him and we know that this is indeed the Savior of the world, the Christ."
\v 43 After the two days, He departed from there and went to Galilee.
\v 44 For Jesus Himself testified that a prophet has no honor in his own country.
\v 45 So when He came to Galilee, the Galileans welcomed Him, having seen all the things He did in Jerusalem at the feast; for they also had gone to the feast.
\v 46 So Jesus came again to Cana of Galilee, where He had made the water wine. And there was a certain royal official whose son was sick at Capernaum.
\v 47 When this man heard that Jesus had come from Judea into Galilee, he went to Him and implored Him to come down and heal his son, for he was at the point of death.
\v 48 Jesus said to him, "Unless you see signs and wonders, you will not believe."
\v 49 The royal official said to him, "Sir, come down before my child dies."
\v 50 Jesus replied, "Go; your son is alive." The man believed the word that Jesus spoke to him, and he departed.
\v 51 As he was descending, his servants met him and reported, saying, 'Your son is alive!'
\v 52 So he asked them at what hour he had begun to get better. They told him that yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him.
\v 53 So the father knew that it was at that very hour when Jesus had said to him, 'Your son lives.' And he himself believed, along with his entire household.
\v 54 This was the second miraculous sign that Jesus performed when He came from Judea into Galilee.
\c 5
\p
\v 1 After this, there was a feast of the Jews, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.
\v 2 Now in Jerusalem, near the Sheep Gate, there is a pool, which is called in Hebrew Bethesda, having five covered colonnades.
\v 3 In these lay a multitude of the sick, blind, lame, and withered, waiting for the moving of the water.
\v 4 For an angel would come down at certain times into the pool and stir the water; whoever stepped in first after the stirring of the water was made whole of whatever disease he had.
\v 5 Now there was a certain man there who had been suffering from his ailment for thirty-eight years.
\v 6 When Jesus saw him lying there and knew that he had already been in that condition for a long time, he said to him, "Do you want to be made whole?"
\v 7 The sick man answered Him, "Sir, I have no one to put me into the pool when the water is stirred; but while I am coming, another steps down before me."
\v 8 Jesus said to him, "Get up, take your mat and walk."
\v 9 And immediately the man became well, and he took up his mat and walked. Now it was the Sabbath on that day.
\v 10 So the Jews said to the man who had been healed, 'It is the Sabbath; it is not lawful for you to take up your bed.'
\v 11 He answered them, 'The one who made me well said to me, ‘Take up your mat and walk.’'
\v 12 They asked him, ‘Who is the man who told you, ‘Pick up your mat and walk’?’
\v 13 But the man who had been healed did not know who it was, for Jesus had slipped away unnoticed in the crowd.
\v 14 Afterward, Jesus found him in the temple and said to him, 'Look, you are well! Sin no more, lest a worse thing happen to you.'
\v 15 The man went away and told the Jews that it was Jesus who had made him well.
\v 16 And because of this, the Jews began to persecute Jesus and sought to kill Him, because He was doing these things on the Sabbath.
\v 17 But Jesus answered them, 'My Father has been working until now, and I am working too.'
\v 18 For this reason, the Jews were seeking all the more to kill Him, because He not only was breaking the Sabbath, but also was saying that God was His own Father, making Himself equal with God.
\v 19 Jesus answered them, "Truly, truly, I say to you, the Son can do nothing by Himself, but only what He sees the Father doing; for whatever the Father does, that the Son does likewise."
\v 20 For the Father loves the Son and shows Him all that He Himself is doing, and greater works than these will He show Him, so that you may marvel.
\v 21 For just as the Father raises the dead and gives them life, so also the Son gives life to whom He wishes.
\v 22 For the Father does not judge anyone, but has entrusted all judgment to the Son.
\v 23 so that all may honor the Son just as they honor the Father. Whoever does not honor the Son does not honor the Father who sent Him.
\v 24 Truly, truly, I say to you, whoever hears My word and believes in Him who sent Me has eternal life; he will not come into judgment, but has passed from death to life.
\v 25 Truly, truly, I tell you, the hour is coming—and now is—when the dead will hear the voice of the Son of God, and those who hear will live.
\v 26 For just as the Father has life in Himself, so He has granted the Son to have life in Himself.
\v 27 And He has given Him authority to execute judgment, because He is the Son of Man.
\v 28 Do not marvel at this; for an hour is coming when all who are in the graves will hear His voice.
\v 29 And those who have done good will emerge to a resurrection of life, but those who have done evil will rise to a resurrection of judgment.
\v 30 I cannot do anything on my own. I judge only as I hear, and my judgment is just because I do not seek my own will, but the will of him who sent me.
\v 31 If I alone bear witness about myself, my testimony is not true.
\v 32 There is another who bears witness about me, and I know that the testimony he gives concerning me is true.
\v 33 You have sent to John, and he has borne witness to the truth.
\v 34 But I do not receive testimony from man; rather, I say these things so that you may be saved.
\v 35 He was a burning and shining lamp, and you were willing to rejoice for a while in his light.
\v 36 But I have a testimony greater than that of John; for the works that the Father has given me to complete, the very works that I am doing, bear witness about me that the Father has sent me.
\v 37 And the Father who sent me, He has testified about me. You have neither heard His voice at any time nor seen His form.
\v 38 But you do not have His word abiding in you, because whom He sent, Him you do not believe.
\v 39 You diligently search the Scriptures because you think that in them you have eternal life; yet they bear witness about Me.
\v 40 Yet you are not willing to come to Me that you may have life.
\v 41 I do not receive glory from men.
\v 42 But I know you, that you do not have the love of God within yourselves.
\v 43 I have come in my Father’s name, and you do not receive me; if another comes in his own name, him you will receive.
\v 44 How can you believe when you accept glory from one another and do not seek the glory that comes from the only God?
\v 45 Do not think that I will accuse you before the Father; there is one who accuses you—Moses, in whom you have placed your hope.
\v 46 For if you believed Moses, you would believe Me; for he wrote of Me.
\v 47 But if you do not believe his writings, how will you believe My words?
\c 6
\p
\v 1 After these things, Jesus went away to the other side of the Sea of Galilee, which is also called the Sea of Tiberias.
\v 2 And a great multitude followed Him, because they saw the signs which He performed on those who were sick.
\v 3 Then Jesus went up into the mountain, and there He sat down with His disciples.
\v 4 Now the Passover, the feast of the Jews, was near.
\v 5 Then Jesus lifted up His eyes and saw that a large crowd was coming toward Him. He said to Philip, "Where shall we buy bread for these people to eat?"
\v 6 This he said to test him, for he himself knew what he was about to do.
\v 7 Philip answered Him, 'Two hundred denarii worth of bread would not be enough for each of them to receive even a little.'
\v 8 One of His disciples, Andrew, the brother of Simon Peter, said to Him,
\v 9 There is a boy here who has five barley loaves and two small fish; but what are they for so many?
\v 10 Jesus said, 'Have the people sit down.' Now there was plenty of grass in that place, and so the men sat down, about five thousand in number.'
\v 11 Jesus took the loaves, and having given thanks, distributed them to the disciples, and the disciples to those who were reclining; likewise also from the fish, as much as they desired.
\v 12 And when they were filled, He said to His disciples, "Gather up the leftover pieces, so that nothing is wasted."
\v 13 So they gathered them up and filled twelve baskets with the fragments from the five barley loaves that had been left over by those who had eaten.
\v 14 When the people saw the sign that Jesus had performed, they exclaimed, 'Surely this is the Prophet who is to come into the world!'
\v 15 Therefore, when Jesus realized that they were about to come and take Him by force to make Him king, He withdrew again to the mountain by Himself.
\v 16 When evening came, His disciples went down to the sea.
\v 17 And when they had boarded the boat, they set out across the sea toward Capernaum. Darkness had already fallen, and Jesus had not yet come to them.
\v 18 The sea was stirred up because a great wind was blowing.
\v 19 So when they had rowed about twenty-five or thirty stadia, they saw Jesus walking on the sea and drawing near to the boat, and they were terrified.
\v 20 But He said to them, 'It is I; do not be afraid.'
\v 21 So they were willing to take Him into the boat, and immediately the boat reached the shore to which they were heading.
\v 22 The next day, the crowd that stood on the other side of the sea saw that there had been no other boat there except the one that His disciples had entered, and that Jesus had not gone with His disciples into the boat, but that His disciples had gone away alone.
\v 23 However, other boats came from Tiberias, near the place where they had eaten the bread after the Lord had given thanks.
\v 24 So when the crowd saw that Jesus was not there, nor His disciples, they got into boats and went to Capernaum, seeking Jesus.
\v 25 And when they found Him on the other side of the sea, they said to Him, 'Rabbi, when did You come here?'
\v 26 Jesus answered them and said, 'Truly, truly, I say to you, you seek Me, not because you saw signs, but because you ate of the loaves and were filled.'
\v 27 Do not labor for the food that perishes, but for the food that endures to eternal life, which the Son of Man will give you; for on Him God the Father has set His seal.
\v 28 Then they said to Him, "What must we do to be doing the works of God?"
\v 29 Jesus answered them, "This is the work of God, that you believe in the one whom He has sent."
\v 30 So they said to Him, 'What then do You do as a sign, so that we may see and believe You? What work do You perform?'
\v 31 Our fathers ate the manna in the wilderness, as it is written, ‘He gave them bread from heaven to eat.’
\v 32 Then Jesus said to them, ‘Truly, truly, I say to you, it was not Moses who gave you the bread from heaven, but my Father gives you the true bread from heaven.'
\v 33 For the bread of God is he who comes down from heaven and gives life to the world.
\v 34 Then they said to Him, 'Lord, always give us this bread.'
\v 35 Then Jesus declared, 'I am the bread of life. Whoever comes to me will never go hungry, and whoever believes in me will never be thirsty.'
\v 36 But I have told you that although you have seen me, you do not believe.
\v 37 All that the Father gives me will come to me, and whoever comes to me I will never cast out.
\v 38 For I have come down from heaven, not to do my own will, but the will of Him who sent me.
\v 39 And this is the will of the Father who sent me: that I should lose none of all that He has given me, but raise them up on the last day.
\v 40 For this is the will of my Father who sent me: that everyone who looks to the Son and believes in Him shall have eternal life, and I will raise him up at the last day.
\v 41 Therefore, the Jews began to complain about Him because He said, 'I am the bread that came down from heaven.'
\v 42 And they said, 'Isn't this Jesus, the son of Joseph, whose father and mother we know? How can he now say that he has come down from heaven?'
\v 43 Jesus answered them, 'Do not murmur among yourselves.'
\v 44 No one can come to me unless the Father who sent me draws him; and I will raise him up on the last day.
\v 45 It is written in the prophets, ‘And they shall all be taught by God.’ Everyone who hears from the Father and learns comes to me.
\v 46 Not that anyone has seen the Father, except he who is from God; he has seen the Father.
\v 47 Truly, truly, I say to you, whoever believes in me has eternal life.
\v 48 I am the bread of life.
\v 49 Your forefathers ate the manna in the wilderness, and they died.
\v 50 This is the bread that comes down from heaven, so that anyone who eats of it may not die.
\v 51 I am the living bread that came down from heaven; if anyone eats of this bread, he will live forever. And the bread that I will give is my flesh, which I will give for the life of the world.
\v 52 So the Jews began to argue among themselves, saying, "How can this man give us his flesh to eat?"
\v 53 So Jesus said to them, "Truly, truly, I say to you, unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink His blood, you do not have life within yourselves."
\v 54 Whoever eats my flesh and drinks my blood has eternal life, and I will raise him up on the last day.
\v 55 For my flesh is truly food, and my blood is truly drink.
\v 56 He who eats my flesh and drinks my blood abides in me, and I in him.
\v 57 Just as the living Father sent me, and I live because of the Father, so whoever feeds on me will also live because of me.
\v 58 This is the bread that came down from heaven; not like the bread that your forefathers ate and died. Whoever eats this bread will live forever.
\v 59 He said these things while teaching in the synagogue at Capernaum.
\v 60 Therefore, many of His disciples, upon hearing this, said, "This teaching is difficult; who can accept it?"
\v 61 But Jesus, knowing in Himself that His disciples were complaining about this, said to them, 'Does this offend you?'
\v 62 What if you were to see the Son of Man ascending to where He was before?
\v 63 It is the Spirit who gives life; the flesh profits nothing. The words that I speak to you are spirit and they are life.
\v 64 But there are some among you who do not believe. For Jesus knew from the beginning who they were who did not believe, and who it was that would betray Him.
\v 65 And He said, "This is why I told you that no one can come to me unless it has been granted him by my Father."
\v 66 From that time, many of His disciples turned back and no longer walked with Him.
\v 67 Jesus then said to the twelve, "Are you also intending to leave?"
\v 68 Simon Peter answered Him, "Lord, to whom shall we go? You have the words of eternal life."
\v 69 And we have come to believe and to know that You are the Christ, the Son of the living God.
\v 70 Jesus answered them, "Did I not choose you, the twelve? And yet one of you is a devil."
\v 71 He spoke of Judas, son of Simon Iscariot; for he was about to betray Him, being one of the twelve.
\c 7
\p
\v 1 After this, Jesus traveled through Galilee; He did not wish to walk in Judea, because the Jews sought to kill Him.
\v 2 Now the Feast of Tabernacles was near, a festival of the Jews.
\v 3 Therefore, His brothers said to Him, "Depart from here and go to Judea, that your disciples may see the works that you are doing."
\v 4 For no one does anything in secret while seeking to be known publicly. If you are doing these things, show yourself to the world.
\v 5 For even his own brothers did not believe in him.
\v 6 Jesus said to them, "My time has not yet come, but your time is always ready."
\v 7 The world cannot hate you, but it hates me because I testify about it that its deeds are evil.
\v 8 You go up to this feast. I am not going up to this feast, because my time has not yet come.
\v 9 After saying this to them, he stayed in Galilee.
\v 10 But when his brothers had gone up to the feast, then he also went up, not openly, but as if in secret.
\v 11 So the Jews were searching for him at the feast, and they were saying, 'Where is that man?'
\v 12 And there was much murmuring about Him among the crowds. Some were saying, 'He is a good man'; others were saying, 'No, He deceives the people.'
\v 13 Yet no one spoke openly about Him because of their fear of the Jews.
\v 14 Now, in the midst of the feast, Jesus went up to the temple and began to teach.
\v 15 And the Jews were astonished, saying, 'How does this man know letters, having never been educated?'
\v 16 Jesus answered them, saying, 'My teaching is not my own, but comes from the One who sent me.'
\v 17 If anyone is willing to do His will, he shall know concerning the teaching, whether it is from God or whether I speak on my own authority.
\v 18 The one who speaks on his own authority seeks his own glory; but the one who seeks the glory of the one who sent him is true, and in him there is no injustice.
\v 19 Did not Moses give you the Law? Yet none of you keeps the Law. Why are you seeking to kill me?
\v 20 The crowd answered, 'You have a demon! Who is seeking to kill you?'
\v 21 Jesus answered and said to them, 'I performed one work, and you all marvel at it for this reason.'
\v 22 Moses gave you the rite of circumcision, not because it is from Moses, but from our ancestors; and you circumcise a man on the Sabbath.
\v 23 If a man receives circumcision on the Sabbath so that the law of Moses may not be broken, are you angry with me because I made an entire man well on the Sabbath?
\v 24 Do not judge according to appearance, but judge with righteous judgment.
\v 25 Therefore some of the people of Jerusalem said, 'Is this not the man whom they seek to kill?'
\v 26 But behold, he speaks with boldness, and they do not say anything to him. Could it be that the rulers indeed know that this one is truly the Christ?
\v 27 But we know where this man comes from; when the Christ appears, no one will know where he comes from.
\v 28 Then Jesus cried out in the temple, teaching and saying, "You both know me and know where I am from; and I have not come on my own authority, but He who sent me is true, whom you do not know."
\v 29 But I know Him, for I am from Him, and He has sent me.
\v 30 Therefore they sought to seize Him, but no one laid hands on Him, because His hour had not yet come.
\v 31 But many of the crowd believed in Him and said, "When the Christ comes, will He perform more signs than this Man has done?"
\v 32 The Pharisees heard the crowd whispering these things about Him, and the Pharisees and the chief priests sent officers to arrest Him.
\v 33 Jesus therefore said, "I will be with you a little while longer, and then I will go to Him who sent Me."
\v 34 You will seek Me, but you will not find Me; and where I am going, you cannot come.
\v 35 Then the Jews said to one another, "Where is He planning to go that we will not find Him? Is He intending to go to the scattered among the Greeks and teach the Greeks?"
\v 36 Who is this man about whom He said, ‘You will seek Me, but you will not find Me; and where I am going, you cannot come’?
\v 37 On the last and greatest day of the feast, Jesus stood and cried out, saying, ‘If anyone thirsts, let him come to Me and drink.’
\v 38 Whoever believes in Me, as the Scripture has said, out of his innermost being will flow rivers of living water.
\v 39 He said this about the Spirit, whom those who believed in him were to receive; for the Spirit had not yet been given, because Jesus was not yet glorified.
\v 40 Many in the crowd, having heard His words, declared, "This man is truly the Prophet."
\v 41 Some said, "This is the Messiah." Others argued, "But does the Messiah come from Galilee?"
\v 42 Is it not written in the Scriptures that the Christ comes from the seed of David and from the village of Bethlehem, where David was?
\v 43 So there arose a division among the crowd because of Him.
\v 44 Some of them wanted to seize Him, but no one laid hands on Him.
\v 45 Then the officers came to the chief priests and Pharisees, who asked them, 'Why did you not bring Him?'
\v 46 The officers answered, 'Never has a man spoken like this Man!'
\v 47 The Pharisees then responded to them, 'Have you also been led astray?'
\v 48 Has any of the rulers or the Pharisees believed in him?
\v 49 But this crowd, which does not know the Law, is accursed!
\v 50 Nicodemus, who had come to Him by night, said to them, 'Does our law judge a man before it hears him and knows what he is doing?'
\v 51 Does our law condemn a man without first hearing from him and knowing what he has done?
\v 52 They answered him, "Are you from Galilee as well? Search and see that no prophet arises from Galilee."
\v 53 And each one went to his own house.
\c 8
\p
\v 1 But Jesus went to the Mount of Olives.
\v 2 But early in the morning, He came again to the temple, and all the people were coming to Him; and He sat down and taught them.
\v 3 Then the scribes and Pharisees brought a woman caught in adultery, and they set her in the midst of the crowd.
\v 4 They said to Him, 'Teacher, this woman has been caught in the act of adultery.'
\v 5 Now in the Law, Moses commanded us to stone such women. What do You say?
\v 6 But Jesus stooped down and wrote on the ground with His finger, as they continued to question Him. He raised His head and asked, "What do you say about this?".
\v 7 When they continued to press Him, He stood up and said to them, "Let the one among you who is without sin be the first to throw a stone at her."
\v 8 And again He bent down and wrote on the ground.
\v 9 But when they heard His words, they began to leave one by one, starting with the oldest, and only Jesus was left, along with the woman who remained standing in the middle.
\v 10 Jesus stood up and said to her, 'Woman, where are they? Has no one condemned you?'
\v 11 She replied, 'No one, Lord.' And Jesus said, 'Neither do I condemn you; go, and from now on, sin no more.'
\v 12 Again, Jesus spoke to them, saying, 'I am the light of the world. Whoever follows Me will never walk in darkness, but will have the light of life.'
\v 13 Then the Pharisees said to Him, 'You bear witness about Yourself; Your testimony is not valid.'
\v 14 Jesus answered and said to them, "Even if I testify about myself, my testimony is indeed valid, for I know where I came from and where I am going; but you do not know where I come from or where I am going."
\v 15 You judge according to human standards; I do not judge anyone.
\v 16 But if I do judge, my judgment is true, for I am not alone in it, but I and the Father who sent me.
\v 17 In your Law it is written that the testimony of two men is valid.
\v 18 I am the one who bears witness of myself, and the Father who sent me bears witness concerning me.
\v 19 They said to Him, 'Where is your Father?' Jesus answered, 'You neither know Me nor My Father. If you had known Me, you would have known My Father also.'
\v 20 These words Jesus spoke in the treasury, teaching in the temple; and no one seized Him, for His hour had not yet come.
\v 21 So again Jesus said to them, 'I am going away, and you will search for me, but you will die in your sin. Where I am going, you cannot come.'
\v 22 So the Jews said, 'Is He going to kill Himself because He says, 
\v 23 And He said to them, 'You are from below; I am from above. You are of this world; I am not of this world.'
\v 24 Therefore, I said to you that you will die in your sins; for unless you believe that I am He, you will die in your sins.
\v 25 So they said to Him, 'Who are You?' And Jesus said to them, 'The beginning, just as I have been telling you from the start.'
\v 26 I have much to say about you and to judge; but he who sent me is true, and I declare to the world what I have heard from him.
\v 27 They did not understand that he was speaking to them about the Father.
\v 28 So Jesus said to them, "When you have lifted up the Son of Man, then you will know that I am He, and that I do nothing on my own, but speak just as the Father taught me."
\v 29 And He who sent me is with me; the Father has not left me alone, for I always do the things that are pleasing to Him.
\v 30 As He spoke these things, many came to believe in Him.
\v 31 So Jesus said to the Jews who had believed Him, "If you hold fast to My word, you are truly My disciples."
\v 32 And you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free.
\v 33 They answered Him, "We are descendants of Abraham and have never been enslaved to anyone. How can You say, ‘You will become free’?"
\v 34 Jesus answered them, "Truly, truly, I say to you, everyone who commits sin is a slave to sin."
\v 35 The slave does not remain in the house forever; the son remains forever.
\v 36 So if the Son sets you free, you will truly be free.
\v 37 I know that you are descendants of Abraham; but you seek to kill me because my word has no place within you.
\v 38 I speak of what I have seen with my Father; so you do what you have seen with your father.
\v 39 They answered him, "Our father is Abraham." Jesus said to them, "If you were truly children of Abraham, you would do the works of Abraham."
\v 40 But now you seek to kill me, a man who has told you the truth that I heard from God; this Abraham did not do.
\v 41 You are doing the works of your father.” They said to him, “We were not born of sexual immorality; we have one Father—even God.”
\v 42 Jesus said to them, "If God were your Father, you would love me; for I came from God and now am here. I did not come of my own accord, but he sent me."
\v 43 Why do you not understand my words? It is because you are unable to listen to my message.
\v 44 You are of your father the devil, and you desire to do the will of your father. He was a murderer from the beginning and has never stood for the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaks, he speaks out of his own nature, for he is a liar and the father of lies.
\v 45 But because I tell you the truth, you do not believe me.
\v 46 Which of you can convict me of sin? If I speak the truth, why do you not believe me?
\v 47 Whoever is of God hears the words of God; therefore, you do not hear them because you are not of God.
\v 48 The Jews answered him, 'Aren’t we right in saying that you are a Samaritan and have a demon?'
\v 49 Jesus answered, "I do not have a demon, but I honor my Father, and you dishonor me."
\v 50 But I do not seek my own glory; there is One who seeks it and judges.
\v 51 Truly, truly, I say to you, if anyone keeps my word, he will never see death.
\v 52 So the Jews said to Him, 'Now we know that you are possessed by a demon. Abraham died, and the prophets as well, yet you say, if anyone keeps your word, he shall never taste death for all eternity.'
\v 53 Are you greater than our father Abraham, who died? And the prophets died as well. Who do you make yourself out to be?
\v 54 Jesus answered, "If I glorify myself, my glory is nothing; it is my Father who glorifies me, of whom you say, ‘He is our God.’"
\v 55 But you have not known Him; I know Him. If I were to say that I do not know Him, I would be a liar like you, but I do know Him and keep His word.
\v 56 Your father Abraham rejoiced at the thought of seeing My day; he saw it and was glad.
\v 57 So the Jews said to Him, 'You are not yet fifty years old, and have You seen Abraham?'
\v 58 Jesus said to them, 'Truly, truly, I say to you, before Abraham was born, I AM.'
\v 59 So they picked up stones to throw at Him, but Jesus evaded them and went out of the temple, passing through their midst.
\c 9
\p
\v 1 As Jesus was passing by, He saw a man who had been blind from birth.
\v 2 And His disciples asked Him, saying, "Rabbi, who sinned, this man or his parents, that he was born blind?"
\v 3 Jesus answered, "Neither this man nor his parents sinned, but this happened so that the works of God might be displayed in him."
\v 4 I must work the works of Him who sent me while it is day; night is coming when no one can work.
\v 5 As long as I am in the world, I am the light of the world.
\v 6 Having said these things, He spat on the ground, made clay with the saliva, and anointed the blind man's eyes with the clay.
\v 7 He said to him, "Go, wash in the Pool of Siloam," which is translated as 'Sent.' So he went and washed, and came back seeing.
\v 8 Therefore, the neighbors and those who had seen him previously as a beggar said, "Is this not the man who used to sit and beg?"
\v 9 Some said, "This is the man." Others said, "No, but he is like him." But he himself declared, "I am he."
\v 10 So they asked him, 'How were your eyes opened?'
\v 11 He answered, 'The man called Jesus made mud and anointed my eyes and told me, “Go to the pool of Siloam and wash.” So I went and washed, and I received my sight.'
\v 12 They asked him, 'Where is the man who healed you?' He replied, 'I do not know.'
\v 13 They brought him who had been blind to the Pharisees.
\v 14 Now it was the Sabbath when Jesus made the clay and opened his eyes.
\v 15 So the Pharisees again asked him how he had received his sight. He replied, 'He put mud on my eyes, and I washed, and now I see.'
\v 16 Therefore, some of the Pharisees said, "This man is not from God, for he does not keep the Sabbath." But others said, "How can a man who is a sinner do such miraculous signs?" And there was division among them.
\v 17 They said to the blind man again, "What do you say about him, since he opened your eyes?" He replied, "He is a prophet."
\v 18 Therefore, the Jews did not believe concerning him that he had been blind and had received his sight, until they called the parents of the one who had received his sight.
\v 19 And they asked them, saying, "Is this your son, whom you say was born blind? How then does he now see?"
\v 20 His parents answered them, saying, 'We know that this is our son, and that he was born blind;'
\v 21 But how he now sees, we do not know; or who opened his eyes, we do not know. He is of age; ask him, he will speak for himself.
\v 22 His parents said these things because they were afraid of the Jewish leaders; for already the Jewish leaders had agreed that if anyone confessed him as the Christ, he would be put out of the synagogue.
\v 23 Therefore, his parents said, ‘He is of age; ask him.’
\v 24 So they called the man who had been blind a second time and said to him, 'Give glory to God; we know that this man is a sinner.'
\v 25 He answered, 'Whether he is a sinner, I do not know; one thing I know: though I was blind, now I see.'
\v 26 They said to him again, 'What did he do to you? How did he open your eyes?'
\v 27 He answered them, 'I told you already, and you did not listen. Why do you want to hear it again? Do you also wish to become his disciples?'
\v 28 They reviled him, saying, 'You are his disciple, but we are disciples of Moses.'
\v 29 We know that God spoke to Moses; but as for this man, we do not know where he comes from.
\v 30 The man answered and said to them, "This is truly remarkable: you do not know where He comes from, and yet He has opened my eyes."
\v 31 We know that God does not listen to sinners, but if anyone is a worshiper of God and does His will, He hears them.
\v 32 Since the world began, it has never been heard that anyone opened the eyes of a man born blind.
\v 33 If this man were not from God, he could do nothing.
\v 34 They answered and said to him, 'You were born entirely in sin, and are you teaching us?' And they cast him out.
\v 35 Jesus heard that they had cast him out, and finding him, said, 'Do you believe in the Son of God?'
\v 36 He answered and said, 'Who is he, Lord, that I may believe in him?'
\v 37 Jesus said to him, 'You have both seen Him, and the one speaking with you is He.'
\v 38 He said, 'Lord, I believe!' And he worshiped Him.
\v 39 And Jesus said, 'For judgment I have come into this world, that those who do not see may see, and those who see may become blind.'
\v 40 Some of the Pharisees who were with Him heard these things and said to Him, 'Are we also blind?'
\v 41 Jesus said to them, "If you were blind, you would have no sin; but now that you say, 'We see,' your sin remains."
\c 10
\p
\v 1 Truly, truly, I say to you, the one who does not enter the sheepfold by the door but climbs in another way, that person is a thief and a robber.
\v 2 But the one who enters through the door is the shepherd of the sheep.
\v 3 To this one, the doorkeeper opens; and the sheep hear his voice, and he calls his own sheep by name and leads them out.
\v 4 And when he has brought out his own sheep, he goes before them, and the sheep follow him because they know his voice.
\v 5 Yet they will never follow a stranger, but will flee from him, for they do not recognize the voice of strangers.
\v 6 Jesus used this figure of speech, but they did not understand what he was telling them.
\v 7 Therefore, Jesus said again, "Truly, truly, I say to you, I am the door of the sheep."
\v 8 All who have come before me are thieves and robbers; but my sheep did not listen to them.
\v 9 I am the door; if anyone enters through me, he will be saved, and will go in and out, and find pasture.
\v 10 The thief comes only to steal, kill, and destroy. I have come that they may have life and have it abundantly.
\v 11 I am the good shepherd. The good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep.
\v 12 But the hired hand, who is not the shepherd, and to whom the sheep do not belong, sees the wolf coming and leaves the sheep and flees; and the wolf snatches them and scatters the flock.
\v 13 The hired hand flees because he is only a hired hand and cares nothing for the sheep.
\v 14 I am the good shepherd; I know my own, and my own know me.
\v 15 Just as the Father knows me, and I know the Father, and I lay down my life for the sheep.
\v 16 And I have other sheep that are not of this fold; I must bring them also, and they will listen to my voice. So there will be one flock, one shepherd.
\v 17 For this reason, the Father loves me, because I lay down my life that I may take it up again.
\v 18 No one takes it away from me, but I lay it down of my own accord. I have authority to lay it down, and I have authority to take it up again. This command I received from my Father.
\v 19 Once again there was a division among the Jews because of these words.
\v 20 Many among them declared, 'He is possessed by a demon and is raving mad; why do you listen to Him?'
\v 21 Others said, 'These are not the words of one possessed by a demon. Can a demon open the eyes of the blind?'
\v 22 Then came the Feast of Dedication in Jerusalem, and it was winter.
\v 23 And Jesus was walking in the temple, in the colonnade of Solomon.
\v 24 So the Jews gathered around him and said to him, 'How long will you keep us in suspense? If you are the Christ, tell us plainly.'
\v 25 Jesus answered them, 'I told you, and you do not believe. The works that I do in my Father’s name bear witness about me.'
\v 26 But you do not believe, because you do not belong to my sheep, as I said to you.
\v 27 My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me.
\v 28 And I give them eternal life, and they will never perish, and no one will snatch them out of my hand.
\v 29 My Father, who has given them to me, is greater than all, and no one can snatch them out of my Father's hand.
\v 30 I and the Father are one.
\v 31 Then the Jews picked up stones again to throw at Him.
\v 32 Jesus answered them, 'I have performed many good deeds before you from my Father. For which of these deeds are you attempting to stone Me?'
\v 33 The Jews answered Him, saying, 'We are not stoning you for a good work, but for blasphemy, and because you, being a man, make yourself God.'
\v 34 Jesus answered them, 'Is it not written in your law, 'I said, you are gods'?
\v 35 If He called them gods to whom the word of God came, and Scripture cannot be broken,
\v 36 Do you say of him whom the Father consecrated and sent into the world, 'You are blaspheming,' because I said, 'I am the Son of God'?}}
\v 37 If I am not performing the works of my Father, do not believe me.
\v 38 But if I do them, even if you do not believe me, believe the works, so that you may know and understand that the Father is in me, and I am in the Father.
\v 39 So they sought again to seize him, but he escaped out of their grasp.
\v 40 And he went away again across the Jordan, to the place where John had been baptizing at first, and there he stayed.
\v 41 And many came to Him and said, 'John performed no miraculous sign, but everything that John said about this man was true.'
\v 42 And many believed in Him there.
\c 11
\p
\v 1 Now a certain man named Lazarus was ill; he was from Bethany, the village of Mary and her sister Martha.
\v 2 Mary, who anointed the Lord with perfume and wiped His feet with her hair, was the sister of Lazarus, who was sick.
\v 3 So the sisters sent word to Him, saying, 'Lord, behold, he whom You love is sick.'
\v 4 When Jesus heard it, He said, "This sickness is not unto death, but for the glory of God, so that the Son of God may be glorified through it."
\v 5 Now Jesus loved Martha and her sister and Lazarus.
\v 6 So when He heard that he was ill, He stayed in the place where He was for two days.
\v 7 Then after this, He said to His disciples, "Let us go back to Judea."
\v 8 The disciples said to Him, "Rabbi, the Jews were just now seeking to stone You, and are You going there again?"
\v 9 Jesus answered, "Are there not twelve hours in the day? If anyone walks during the day, he will not stumble, because he sees the light of this world."
\v 10 But if anyone walks at night, he stumbles, because the light is not in him.
\v 11 He said these things, and after that, He told them, 'Our friend Lazarus has fallen asleep, but I go to awaken him.'
\v 12 The disciples said to Him, 'Lord, if he has fallen asleep, he will recover.'
\v 13 Jesus had spoken of his death, but they thought that He meant he was taking rest in sleep.
\v 14 Then Jesus told them plainly, "Lazarus has died."
\v 15 And I rejoice on account of you, so that you may believe, for I was not there; but let us go to him.
\v 16 Then Thomas, who is called the Twin, said to his fellow disciples, 'Let us also go, that we may die with him.'
\v 17 When Jesus arrived, he found that Lazarus had already been in the tomb for four days.
\v 18 Now Bethany was near Jerusalem, about fifteen stadia away.
\v 19 And many of the Jews had come to Martha and Mary to offer them consolation concerning their brother.
\v 20 So when Martha heard that Jesus was coming, she went out to meet Him; but Mary sat still in the house.
\v 21 Martha then said to Jesus, "Lord, if You had been here, my brother would not have died."
\v 22 But even now, I know that whatever you ask of God, God will grant you.
\v 23 Jesus said to her, "Your brother will rise again."
\v 24 Martha said to Him, "I know that he will rise again in the resurrection at the last day."
\v 25 Jesus said to her, 'I am the resurrection and the life.'
\v 26 And everyone who believes in me, even if he dies, will live; and everyone who is alive and believes in me shall never die. Do you believe this?
\v 27 She said to Him, "Yes, Lord; I have come to believe that You are the Christ, the Son of God, who is coming into the world."
\v 28 And having said this, she went away and secretly called her sister Mary, saying, "The Teacher is here and is calling for you."
\v 29 As soon as she heard this, she got up quickly and went to Him.
\v 30 But Jesus had not yet come into the village, but was still in the place where Martha met Him.
\v 31 So the Jews who were with her in the house, comforting her, noticed that Mary had quickly risen and gone out. They followed her, saying, "She is going to the tomb to weep there."
\v 32 When Mary arrived where Jesus was and saw him, she fell at his feet, saying to him, "Lord, if you had been here, my brother would not have died."
\v 33 When Jesus saw her weeping, and the Jews who had come with her also weeping, he was deeply moved in spirit and troubled himself.
\v 34 And He asked, 'Where have you laid him?' They replied, 'Lord, come and see.'
\v 35 Jesus wept.
\v 36 So the Jews said, "See how He loved him!"
\v 37 But some of them said, 'Could not this man, who opened the eyes of the blind, have also kept this man from dying?'
\v 38 Then Jesus, once more deeply moved within Himself, approached the tomb. It was a cave, and a stone was lying against it.
\v 39 Jesus said, 'Remove the stone.' Martha, the sister of the deceased, said to Him, 'Lord, by this time there will be a stench, for he has been dead four days.'
\v 40 Jesus said to her, 'Did I not tell you that if you believe, you will see the glory of God?'
\v 41 So they took away the stone from the place where the dead man was lying. And Jesus lifted His eyes upward and said, 'Father, I thank You that You have heard Me.'
\v 42 But I knew that You always hear Me; but because of the crowd standing here, I said this, so that they may believe that You sent Me.
\v 43 And when He had said these things, He called out in a loud voice, 'Lazarus, come forth!'
\v 44 And the dead man came out, his hands and feet still wrapped in grave clothes, and a cloth was around his face. Jesus said to them, 'Unbind him and let him go.'
\v 45 Therefore, many of the Jews who had come to Mary and had seen what Jesus did believed in Him.
\v 46 But some of them went to the Pharisees and told them what Jesus had done.
\v 47 So the chief priests and the Pharisees gathered the Sanhedrin and said, 'What are we to do? This man is performing many signs.'
\v 48 If we let him go on like this, everyone will believe in him, and the Romans will come and take away both our place and our nation.
\v 49 But one of them, Caiaphas, who was high priest that year, said to them, 'You know nothing at all.'
\v 50 You do not realize that it is better for us that one man should die for the people, rather than the whole nation be destroyed.
\v 51 But he did not say this on his own; as high priest that year, he prophesied that Jesus was going to die for the nation.
\v 52 And not for the nation only, but also to gather together in one the children of God who are scattered abroad.
\v 53 From that day on, they plotted together to put Him to death.
\v 54 Therefore, Jesus no longer walked openly among the Jews, but departed from there to a region near the wilderness, to a city called Ephraim, and there He stayed with His disciples.
\v 55 Now the Passover of the Jews was near, and many went up to Jerusalem from the country before the Passover to purify themselves.
\v 56 So they were seeking Jesus and were saying to one another in the temple, "What do you think? Will He not come to the feast?"
\v 57 So the chief priests and the Pharisees had given a command that if anyone knew where He was, he should report it, so that they might seize Him.
\c 12
\p
\v 1 Then Jesus came to Bethany six days before the Passover, where Lazarus was, the one who had died, whom He raised from the dead.
\v 2 So they made Him a dinner there, and Martha served; but Lazarus was one of those who sat at the table with Him.
\v 3 Then Mary took a pound of very costly perfume made from pure nard, anointed the feet of Jesus, and wiped His feet with her hair; and the house was filled with the fragrance of the perfume.
\v 4 But one of His disciples, Judas Iscariot, son of Simon, who would later betray Him, said:
\v 5 Why wasn’t this perfume sold for three hundred denarii and given to the poor?
\v 6 He said this not because he cared about the poor, but because he was a thief; and having the money bag, he used to steal what was put into it.
\v 7 Then Jesus said, "Leave her alone; she has kept this for the day of my burial."
\v 8 For you will always have the poor among you, but you will not always have me.
\v 9 Then a great crowd of Jews learned that he was there, and they came not only because of Jesus but also to see Lazarus, whom he had raised from the dead.
\v 10 But the chief priests plotted to kill Lazarus as well,
\v 11 because many of the Jews were going away and believing in Jesus because of him.
\v 12 The next day, a large crowd that had come to the feast heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem.
\v 13 They took palm branches and went out to meet him, and they cried out: 'Hosanna! Blessed is the one who comes in the name of the Lord, the King of Israel!'
\v 14 Jesus found a young donkey and sat upon it, just as it is written.
\v 15 Do not be afraid, Daughter of Zion; see, your King is coming, seated on a young donkey.
\v 16 These things His disciples did not understand at first; but when Jesus was glorified, then they remembered that these things were written about Him, and that they had done these things to Him.
\v 17 The crowd that had been with Him when He called Lazarus from the tomb and raised him from the dead continued to bear witness.
\v 18 For this reason, the crowd went out to meet Him, because they heard that He had performed this miraculous sign.
\v 19 Therefore, the Pharisees said to one another, "You see that you are gaining nothing. Look, the world has gone after Him."
\v 20 Now there were some Greeks among those who went up to worship at the feast.
\v 21 These approached Philip, who was from Bethsaida in Galilee, and asked him, saying, "Sir, we wish to see Jesus."
\v 22 Philip came and told Andrew; Andrew and Philip went and said to Jesus.
\v 23 But Jesus answered them, saying, 'The hour has come for the Son of Man to be glorified.'
\v 24 Truly, truly, I say to you, unless a grain of wheat falls into the earth and dies, it remains alone; but if it dies, it bears much fruit.
\v 25 The one who loves his life will lose it, but the one who hates his life in this world will keep it for eternal life.
\v 26 If anyone serves Me, let him follow Me; and where I am, there My servant will be also. If anyone serves Me, the Father will honor him.
\v 27 Now My soul is troubled, and what shall I say? Father, save Me from this hour? But for this very reason I came to this hour.
\v 28 Father, glorify Your name.' Then a voice came from heaven, saying, 'I have glorified it, and I will glorify it again.'
\v 29 The crowd that stood there and heard it said that it had thundered; others said, 'An angel spoke to Him.'
\v 30 Jesus answered and said, 'This voice was not for My sake, but for your sake.'
\v 31 Now is the judgment of this world; now the ruler of this world will be cast out.
\v 32 And I, when I am lifted up from the earth, will draw all people to myself.
\v 33 He said this to indicate the kind of death by which he was to die.
\v 34 The crowd answered him, "We have heard from the Law that the Christ remains forever. How can you say that the Son of Man must be lifted up? Who is this Son of Man?"
\v 35 Then Jesus said to them, "The light is with you a little longer; walk while you have the light, so that darkness does not overtake you. The one who walks in darkness does not know where he is going."
\v 36 While you have the light, believe in the light, so that you may become children of light.' After saying this, Jesus withdrew and concealed Himself from them.
\v 37 Despite all the miraculous signs He had performed in their presence, they still did not believe in Him.
\v 38 So that the word of the prophet Isaiah might be fulfilled, which he said: "Lord, who has believed our report? And to whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed?"
\v 39 For this reason, they were unable to believe, because again Isaiah said:
\v 40 He has blinded their eyes and hardened their hearts, so that they would not see with their eyes, nor understand with their hearts, and turn, and I would heal them.
\v 41 These things Isaiah said when he beheld His glory and spoke of Him.
\v 42 Yet even among the rulers, many believed in Him, but because of the Pharisees they did not confess Him, so that they would not be expelled from the synagogue.
\v 43 For they loved the glory that comes from men more than the glory that comes from God.
\v 44 Jesus cried out and said, 'Whoever believes in me does not merely believe in me, but in the One who sent me.'
\v 45 And the one who sees me sees the One who sent me.
\v 46 I have come as a light into the world, that whoever believes in me may not remain in darkness.
\v 47 And if anyone hears my words and does not believe, I do not judge him; for I did not come to judge the world, but to save the world.
\v 48 The one who rejects me and does not receive my words has a judge; the very word that I have spoken will judge him on the last day.
\v 49 For I have not spoken on my own authority, but the Father who sent me has given me a command: what I should say and what I should speak.
\v 50 And I know that His command is eternal life. Therefore, the things I speak, I speak just as the Father has told me.
\c 13
\p
\v 1 Now, before the Feast of Passover, Jesus, knowing that His hour had come to depart from this world to the Father, having loved His own who were in the world, He loved them to the end.
\v 2 And during the meal, when the devil had already put it into the heart of Judas Iscariot, the son of Simon, to betray Him.
\v 3 Knowing that the Father had given all things into His hands, and that He had come from God and was going to God,
\v 4 He arose from the meal, laid aside His outer garments, and taking a towel, He wrapped it around Himself.
\v 5 Then He poured water into a basin and began to wash the feet of the disciples, drying them with the towel with which He was girded.
\v 6 He came to Simon Peter, who said to him, 'Lord, are you washing my feet?'
\v 7 Jesus answered him, "What I am doing you do not understand now, but afterward you will know."
\v 8 Peter said to Him, "You shall never wash my feet!" Jesus answered him, "If I do not wash you, you have no part with Me."
\v 9 Simon Peter said to Him, 'Lord, not only my feet, but also my hands and my head!'
\v 10 Jesus said to him, "He who has bathed needs only to wash his feet, but is completely clean; and you are clean, though not all of you."
\v 11 For He knew the one who would betray Him; that is why He said, 'Not all of you are clean.'
\v 12 So when He had washed their feet and put on His outer garments, He reclined again and said to them, 'Do you understand what I have done for you?'
\v 13 You call me Teacher and Lord, and you speak rightly, for I am.
\v 14 If I then, your Lord and Teacher, have washed your feet, you also ought to wash one another's feet.
\v 15 For I have given you an example, that you should do as I have done to you.
\v 16 Truly, truly, I say to you, a servant is not greater than his master, nor is an apostle greater than the one who sent him.
\v 17 If you know these things, blessed are you if you do them.
\v 18 I do not speak concerning all of you; I know whom I have chosen. But this is to fulfill the Scripture: 'He who eats bread with me has lifted his heel against me.'
\v 19 From now on, I tell you before it happens, so that when it does happen, you may believe that I am.
\v 20 Truly, truly, I say to you, whoever receives anyone I send receives me; and whoever receives me receives the one who sent me.
\v 21 After saying this, Jesus was troubled in his spirit and testified, "Truly, truly, I say to you, one of you will betray me."
\v 22 The disciples looked at one another, confused about whom He was talking about.
\v 23 Now one of His disciples was reclining close to Jesus, the one whom Jesus loved.
\v 24 So Simon Peter motioned to this disciple to ask Jesus of whom He was speaking.
\v 25 So he leaned back against Jesus’ chest and asked Him, 'Lord, who is it?'
\v 26 Jesus answered, 'It is the one to whom I shall give this piece of bread after I have dipped it.' And having dipped the piece of bread, He gave it to Judas Iscariot, the son of Simon.
\v 27 And after the piece of bread, Satan entered into him. Jesus then said to him, 'What you are about to do, do it quickly.'
\v 28 But no one at the table understood why He said this to him.
\v 29 Some thought that because Judas had the money bag, Jesus was telling him to buy what we need for the feast, or to give something to the poor.
\v 30 So, after receiving the piece of bread, he immediately went out. And it was night.
\v 31 When he had gone out, Jesus said, "Now the Son of Man is glorified, and God is glorified in Him.
\v 32 If God is glorified in Him, God will also glorify Him in Himself, and will glorify Him immediately.
\v 33 Little children, I am with you only a little while longer. You will seek me, and just as I told the Jews, so I tell you now: where I am going, you cannot come.
\v 34 A new command I give to you: that you love one another, just as I have loved you, you also are to love one another.
\v 35 By this, all people will know that you are My disciples, if you have love for one another.
\v 36 Simon Peter said to Him, 'Lord, where are You going?' Jesus answered him, 'Where I am going, you cannot follow now, but you will follow afterward.'
\v 37 Peter said to Him, 'Lord, why can’t I follow You now? I will lay down my life for You.'
\v 38 Jesus answered him, 'Will you lay down your life for me? Truly, truly, I say to you, the rooster will not crow until you have denied me three times.'
\c 14
\p
\v 1 Let not your hearts be troubled. Trust in God; trust also in me.
\v 2 In my Father's house, there are many rooms; if it were not so, I would have told you. I am going to prepare a place for you.
\v 3 And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again and take you to myself, that where I am, you may also be.
\v 4 And you know where I am going, and you know the way to get there.
\v 5 Thomas said to Him, "Lord, we do not know where You are going, and how can we know the way?"
\v 6 Jesus said to him, "I am the way, the truth, and the life; no one comes to the Father except through me."
\v 7 If you had truly known me, you would have also known my Father. From now on, you know him and have seen him.
\v 8 Philip said to him, "Lord, show us the Father, and it is enough for us."
\v 9 Jesus said to him, "Have I been with you so long, and yet you do not know me, Philip? Whoever has seen me has seen the Father. How can you say, 'Show us the Father'?"
\v 10 Do you not believe that I am in the Father and the Father is in me? The words that I speak to you, I do not speak on my own authority, but it is the Father who dwells in me, performing His works.
\v 11 Believe me that I am in the Father and the Father is in me; but if you do not, believe because of the works themselves.
\v 12 Truly, truly, I say to you, whoever believes in me will also do the works that I do; and greater works than these will he do, because I am going to the Father.
\v 13 And whatever you ask in my name, that I will do, so that the Father may be glorified in the Son.
\v 14 If you ask me anything in my name, I will do it.
\v 15 If you love me, you will keep my commandments.
\v 16 And I will ask the Father, and He will give you another Helper, that He may abide with you forever.
\v 17 the Spirit of truth, whom the world cannot receive because it neither sees Him nor knows Him; but you know Him, for He dwells with you and will be in you.
\v 18 I will not leave you as orphans; I am coming to you.
\v 19 A little longer, and the world will no longer see me, but you will see me; because I live, you also will live.
\v 20 In that day you will know that I am in my Father, and you in me, and I in you.
\v 21 The one who has my commandments and keeps them, that person is the one who loves me. And the one who loves me will be loved by my Father, and I will love them and reveal myself to them.
\v 22 Judas (not Iscariot) said to Him, "Lord, what has happened that you will reveal yourself to us and not to the world?"
\v 23 Jesus answered and said to him, "If anyone loves me, he will keep my word, and my Father will love him, and we will come to him and make our dwelling with him."
\v 24 The one who does not love me does not keep my words; and the message you hear is not mine, but belongs to the Father who sent me.
\v 25 I have spoken these things to you while remaining with you.
\v 26 But the Helper, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in my name, he will teach you all things and bring to your remembrance all that I have said to you.
\v 27 Peace I leave with you; my peace I give to you. Not as the world gives do I give to you. Let not your hearts be troubled, neither let them be afraid.
\v 28 You heard me say to you, ‘I am going away and will return to you.’ If you loved me, you would have rejoiced because I said, ‘I am going to the Father,’ for the Father is greater than I.
\v 29 And now I have told you before it occurs, so that when it does happen, you may believe.
\v 30 I will not talk with you much longer, for the ruler of this world is coming, and he has no hold on me.
\v 31 But I do this so that the world may know that I love the Father, and as the Father commanded me, so I do. Rise, let us go from here.
\c 15
\p
\v 1 I am the true vine, and my Father is the vinedresser.
\v 2 Every branch in me that does not bear fruit, he takes away; and every branch that does bear fruit, he prunes, that it may bear more fruit.
\v 3 You are already clean because of the word I have spoken to you.
\v 4 Abide in me, and I in you. Just as the branch cannot bear fruit by itself unless it abides in the vine, neither can you bear fruit unless you abide in me.
\v 5 I am the vine; you are the branches. The one who remains in me, and I in them, bears much fruit; for apart from me you can do nothing.
\v 6 If anyone does not abide in me, he is thrown out like a withered branch and is gathered up and cast into the fire, where it is burned.
\v 7 If you abide in Me, and My words abide in you, ask whatever you wish, and it will be done for you.
\v 8 In this, my Father is glorified, that you bear much fruit and so prove to be my disciples.
\v 9 Just as the Father has loved me, so I have loved you; abide in my love.
\v 10 If you keep my commandments, you will abide in my love, just as I have kept my Father's commandments and abide in His love.
\v 11 I have spoken these things to you so that my joy may remain in you and that your joy may be made complete.
\v 12 This is my commandment, that you love one another just as I have loved you.
\v 13 Greater love has no one than this, that someone lays down his life for his friends.
\v 14 You are my friends if you do what I command you.
\v 15 I no longer call you servants, for the servant does not know what his master is doing; instead, I have called you friends, for all that I have heard from my Father I have made known to you.
\v 16 You did not choose me, but I chose you; and I appointed you to go and bear lasting fruit, so that whatever you ask the Father in my name, He may give you.
\v 17 These things I command you, that you love one another.
\v 18 If the world hates you, know that it has hated me before it hated you.
\v 19 If you belonged to the world, it would love you as its own; but because you do not belong to the world, and I have chosen you out of the world, therefore the world hates you.
\v 20 Remember the word that I spoke to you: 'A servant is not greater than his master.' If they persecuted me, they will also persecute you; if they kept my word, they will keep yours also.
\v 21 But all these things they will do to you because of my name, for they do not know the one who sent me.
\v 22 If I had not come and spoken to them, they would not be guilty of sin; but now they have no excuse for their sin.
\v 23 Whoever hates me also hates my Father.
\v 24 If I had not done among them the works that no one else did, they would not be guilty of sin; but now they have seen and hated both me and my Father.
\v 25 But this is to fulfill the word that is written in their Law: ‘They hated Me without a cause.’
\v 26 But when the Helper comes, whom I will send to you from the Father, the Spirit of truth who proceeds from the Father, He will bear witness about Me.
\v 27 And you also will testify, because you have been with Me from the beginning.
\c 16
\p
\v 1 These things I have spoken to you so that you would not be led astray.
\v 2 They will expel you from the synagogues; indeed, the hour is coming when anyone who kills you will think they are offering service to God.
\v 3 And they will do these things because they have not known the Father nor Me.
\v 4 But I have spoken these things to you so that when the hour comes, you may remember them, that I told you. These things I did not say to you from the beginning, because I was with you.
\v 5 But now I am going to Him who sent Me, and none of you asks Me, ‘Where are You going?’
\v 6 But because I have spoken these things to you, your hearts have been filled with grief.
\v 7 But truly, I tell you, it is for your benefit that I go away. For if I do not go away, the Helper will not come to you; but if I depart, I will send Him to you.
\v 8 And when He comes, He will convict the world concerning sin, righteousness, and judgment.
\v 9 about sin, because they do not believe in Me.
\v 10 and concerning righteousness, because I am going to the Father, and you will see Me no more.
\v 11 and concerning judgment, because the ruler of this world has been judged.
\v 12 I still have many things to say to you, but you cannot bear them now.
\v 13 But when that one comes, the Spirit of truth, he will guide you into all truth; for he will not speak from himself, but whatever he hears, that will he speak, and he will declare to you the things that are to come.
\v 14 He will glorify me, for he will take what is mine and declare it to you.
\v 15 All that the Father has is mine; therefore I said that He will take from what is mine and declare it to you.
\v 16 A little while, and you will no longer see me; and again a little while, and you will see me, because I am going to the Father.
\v 17 So some of his disciples said to one another, 'What does he mean by saying to us, “A little while, and you will not see me; and again a little while, and you will see me,” and, “Because I am going to the Father”?'
\v 18 So they were saying, 'What does he mean by saying, “A little while”? We do not understand what he is talking about.'
\v 19 Jesus knew they wanted to ask him about this, so he said to them, 'Are you discussing with one another what I meant when I said, “In a little while you will not see me, and then again in a little while you will see me”?'
\v 20 Truly, truly, I say to you, you will weep and mourn, but the world will rejoice; you will be sad, but your sadness will turn into joy.
\v 21 A woman, when she is in labor, experiences anguish because her time has come; but when she gives birth to the child, she no longer remembers the pain, for joy has come that a human being has been born into the world.
\v 22 So now you indeed have sorrow, but I will see you again, and your hearts will rejoice, and your joy no one will take from you.
\v 23 And in that day you will not ask Me anything. Truly, truly, I say to you, whatever you ask the Father in My name, He will give it to you.
\v 24 Until now, you have not asked anything in My name. Ask, and you will receive, so that your joy may be complete.
\v 25 These things I have spoken to you in figures of speech; but the time is coming when I will no longer speak to you in figures, but will tell you plainly about the Father.
\v 26 In that day, you will ask in My name; and I do not say that I will ask the Father on your behalf.
\v 27 For the Father himself loves you, because you have loved me and have believed that I came forth from God.
\v 28 I came forth from the Father and have come into the world; again, I leave the world and go to the Father.
\v 29 His disciples said, 'Now You are speaking plainly and not using a figure of speech.'
\v 30 Now we know that You know all things and do not need anyone to question You. By this, we believe that You came forth from God.
\v 31 Jesus answered them, "Now you believe."
\v 32 Behold, the hour is coming, and indeed has come, when you will be scattered, each to your own place, and you will leave me alone; yet I am not alone, for the Father is with me.
\v 33 I have spoken these things to you so that in me you may have peace. In the world you will have tribulation; but take heart, I have overcome the world.
\c 17
\p
\v 1 These things Jesus spoke, and lifting His eyes to heaven, He said: 'Father, the time has come; glorify Your Son, that the Son may also glorify You.
\v 2 As You have granted Him authority over all flesh, that He should give eternal life to all whom You have given Him.
\v 3 And this is eternal life: that they may know You, the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom You have sent.
\v 4 I have glorified You on earth by completing the work You gave Me to do.
\v 5 And now, Father, glorify Me alongside Yourself with the glory that I had with You before the world existed.
\v 6 I have manifested Your name to the people whom You gave Me out of the world. They were Yours, and You gave them to Me, and they have kept Your word.
\v 7 Now they know that everything You have given to Me is from You;
\v 8 For I have given them the words You gave Me, and they received them, and truly understood that I came forth from You, and they believed that You sent Me.
\v 9 I ask on behalf of them; I do not ask on behalf of the world, but for those whom You have given Me, for they are Yours.
\v 10 And all that is Mine is Yours, and all that is Yours is Mine; and I have been glorified in them.
\v 11 And I am no longer in the world, but these are in the world, and I am coming to You. Holy Father, protect them by the power of Your name, the name You gave Me, so that they may be one, just as We are one.
\v 12 While I was with them, I kept them in Your name. Those whom You gave Me I have preserved; none of them is lost except the son of perdition, so that the Scripture might be fulfilled.
\v 13 But now I come to You, and these things I speak in the world so that they may have My joy fulfilled in them.
\v 14 I have given them Your word; and the world has hated them because they are not of the world, just as I am not of the world.
\v 15 I do not ask that You take them out of the world, but that You keep them safe from the evil one.
\v 16 They are not of the world, just as I am not of the world.
\v 17 Sanctify them in Your truth; Your word is truth.
\v 18 As You sent Me into the world, I have sent them into the world.
\v 19 And for their sake, I consecrate Myself, that they also may be sanctified in the truth.
\v 20 I do not ask for these only, but also for those who will believe in Me through their word.
\v 21 That they may all be one, just as You, Father, are in Me and I in You; that they also may be one in Us, so that the world may believe that You sent Me.
\v 22 And I have given them the glory which You gave Me, that they may be one, just as We are one.
\v 23 I in them, and You in Me, that they may be made complete in one, and that the world may know that You sent Me and have loved them even as You have loved Me.
\v 24 Father, those whom You have given Me, I desire that they also, whom I will be with, may be where I am, to behold My glory which You have given Me, for You loved Me before the foundation of the world.
\v 25 Righteous Father, although the world has not known You, I have known You; and these have come to know that You sent Me.
\v 26 And I have made Your name known to them and will continue to make it known, so that the love with which You have loved Me may be in them, and I in them.
\c 18
\p
\v 1 When Jesus had spoken these words, He went forth with His disciples across the Kidron Valley, where there was a garden, into which He and His disciples entered.
\v 2 And Judas, who was betraying Him, knew the place, for Jesus had often met there with His disciples.
\v 3 So Judas, having taken the detachment of soldiers and officers from the chief priests and Pharisees, came there with lanterns, torches, and weapons.
\v 4 Jesus, knowing all that was about to happen to him, went forward and said to them, 'Whom do you seek?'
\v 5 They answered him, 'Jesus of Nazareth.' Jesus said to them, 'I am.' And Judas, who was betraying him, stood with them.
\v 6 When Jesus said to them, 'I am he,' they drew back and fell to the ground.
\v 7 Again he asked them, 'Whom do you seek?' And they replied, 'Jesus of Nazareth.'
\v 8 Jesus answered, 'I told you that I am He. Therefore, if you seek Me, let these go their way.'
\v 9 This was to fulfill the word that He had spoken: ‘Of those whom You gave Me, I have lost not one.'
\v 10 Then Simon Peter, having a sword, drew it and struck the servant of the high priest, cutting off his right ear; the servant's name was Malchus.
\v 11 Jesus said to Peter, "Put your sword back into its sheath. Shall I not drink the cup that the Father has given me?"
\v 12 So the cohort, along with the captain and the officers of the Jews, arrested Jesus and bound him.
\v 13 And they led him first to Annas, for he was the father-in-law of Caiaphas, who was the high priest that year.
\v 14 Caiaphas was the one who had advised the Jewish leaders that it was more advantageous for one man to die for the people.
\v 15 Simon Peter followed Jesus, and so did another disciple. This disciple was known to the high priest, and he entered with Jesus into the courtyard of the high priest.
\v 16 But Peter stood outside by the entrance. Then the other disciple, who was known to the high priest, went out and spoke to the doorkeeper and brought Peter in.
\v 17 The servant girl who kept the door said to Peter, "You are not also one of this man's disciples, are you?" He said, "I am not."
\v 18 Meanwhile, the servants and the officers had made a charcoal fire, because it was cold, and they were warming themselves. Peter was also with them, standing and warming himself.
\v 19 The high priest then questioned Jesus about his disciples and about his teaching.
\v 20 Jesus answered him, 'I spoke openly to the world. I always taught in synagogues and in the temple, where all the Jews come together; I have said nothing in secret.'
\v 21 Why do you ask me? Ask those who heard me what I said to them; behold, they know what I said.
\v 22 When He had said these things, one of the officers standing by gave a slap to Jesus, saying, "Is that how you answer the high priest?"
\v 23 Jesus answered him, "If I have spoken wrongly, testify concerning the wrong; but if I have spoken rightly, why do you strike me?"
\v 24 Annas then sent him bound to Caiaphas the high priest.
\v 25 Now Simon Peter stood and warmed himself. They said to him, "Are you not also one of His disciples?" He denied it and said, "I am not."
\v 26 But he denied it, saying, "I am not." One of the servants of the high priest, a relative of the one whose ear Peter had cut off, said to him, "Did I not see you in the garden with him?"
\v 27 Again, Peter denied it, and immediately a rooster crowed.
\v 28 Then they led Jesus from Caiaphas to the governor’s headquarters. It was early morning; and they themselves did not enter the governor’s headquarters, so that they would not be defiled, but could eat the Passover.
\v 29 So Pilate went out to them and said, 'What accusation do you bring against this man?'
\v 30 They answered him, 'If this man were not a wrongdoer, we would not have delivered him over to you.'
\v 31 Then Pilate said to them, 'Take him yourselves and judge him by your own law.' The Jews replied to him, 'It is not lawful for us to put anyone to death.'
\v 32 This was to fulfill the word that Jesus had spoken, signifying by what kind of death he was going to die.
\v 33 Pilate then entered the praetorium again, called for Jesus, and said to Him, 'Are You the King of the Jews?'
\v 34 Jesus answered him, 'Are you saying this on your own, or have others told you about Me?'
\v 35 Pilate replied, 'Am I a Jew? Your own nation and the chief priests have delivered You to me. What have You done?'
\v 36 Jesus answered, 'My kingdom is not of this world; if My kingdom were of this world, My servants would fight, so that I should not be delivered to the Jews. But now My kingdom is not from here.'
\v 37 Therefore Pilate said to Him, 'So you are a king?' Jesus answered, 'You say that I am a king. For this purpose I was born, and for this purpose I have come into the world, to bear witness to the truth. Everyone who is of the truth hears My voice.'
\v 38 Pilate said to Him, 'What is truth?' And having said this, he went out again to the Jews and told them, 'I find no fault in Him.'
\v 39 But it is your custom that I release one prisoner to you at Passover. Therefore, do you want me to release to you the King of the Jews?
\v 40 So they all shouted again, saying, "Not this man, but Barabbas!" Now Barabbas was a robber.
\c 19
\p
\v 1 Then Pilate took Jesus and had Him scourged.
\v 2 And the soldiers, weaving a crown of thorns, placed it upon His head, and arrayed Him in a purple garment.
\v 3 And they kept saying, 'Hail, King of the Jews!' and they struck Him with their hands.
\v 4 Then Pilate went out again and said to them, 'Behold, I am bringing Him out to you, so that you may know that I find no fault in Him.'
\v 5 Then Jesus came out wearing the crown of thorns and the purple robe. And Pilate said to them, 'Behold the Man!'
\v 6 When the chief priests and officers saw Him, they cried out, saying, 'Crucify Him! Crucify Him!' Pilate said to them, 'You take Him and crucify Him, for I find no fault in Him.'
\v 7 The Jews answered him, 'We have a law, and according to our law, He ought to die because He made Himself the Son of God.'
\v 8 When Pilate heard this statement, he became even more afraid.
\v 9 And he entered the Praetorium again and said to Jesus, "Where are You from?" But Jesus gave him no answer.
\v 10 Pilate said to Him, "Are You not speaking to me? Do You not know that I have the power to crucify You and the power to release You?"
\v 11 Jesus answered, "You would have no authority over Me at all unless it had been given to you from above. Therefore, the one who has delivered Me to you has the greater sin."
\v 12 From then on, Pilate sought to release Him; but the Jews cried out, saying, "If you let this Man go, you are not Caesar's friend. Whoever makes himself a king speaks against Caesar."
\v 13 When Pilate heard these words, he brought Jesus out and sat down on the judgment seat at a place called Lithostratos, which in Hebrew is called Gabbatha.
\v 14 Now it was the day of preparation for the Passover, about the sixth hour. He said to the Jews, "Behold, your King!"
\v 15 But they shouted, 'Away with Him! Away with Him! Crucify Him!' Pilate said to them, 'Shall I crucify your King?' The chief priests answered, 'We have no king but Caesar.'
\v 16 Then Pilate handed Him over to them to be crucified.
\v 17 So they took Jesus, and He went out, bearing His cross to the place called The Skull, which is called in Hebrew, Golgotha.
\v 18 There they crucified Him, and with Him were two others, one on either side, and Jesus in the middle.
\v 19 Pilate also wrote a title and put it on the cross. It was written: "Jesus of Nazareth, the King of the Jews."
\v 20 Therefore, this title was read by many of the Jews, for the place where Jesus was crucified was near the city; and it was written in Hebrew, Greek, and Latin.
\v 21 Therefore the chief priests of the Jews said to Pilate, "Do not write, 'The King of the Jews,' but rather, 'This man said, I am the King of the Jews.'"
\v 22 Pilate answered, "What I have written, I have written."
\v 23 Then the soldiers, when they had crucified Jesus, took His garments and made four parts, to each soldier a part, and also the tunic; now the tunic was seamless, woven in one piece from the top.
\v 24 So they said to one another, 'Let us not tear it, but cast lots for it to see whose it will be,' so that the scripture might be fulfilled which says: 'They divided my garments among themselves, and for my clothing, they cast lots.'
\v 25 So the soldiers did these things. But standing near the cross of Jesus were his mother, and his mother’s sister, Mary the wife of Clopas, and Mary Magdalene.
\v 26 When Jesus saw his mother and the disciple whom he loved standing nearby, he said to her, "Woman, behold your son!"
\v 27 Then he said to the disciple, 'Behold, your mother!' And from that hour, the disciple took her into his own home.
\v 28 After this, knowing that all things were now accomplished, that the Scripture might be fulfilled, Jesus said, 'I thirst.'
\v 29 Now a jar full of sour wine was sitting there; so they put a sponge soaked in the sour wine on a branch of hyssop and held it up to His mouth.
\v 30 When Jesus had received the sour wine, He said, 'It is finished!' And bowing His head, He gave up His spirit.
\v 31 Therefore, the Jews, because it was the day of Preparation, so that the bodies would not remain on the cross during the Sabbath (for that Sabbath was a high day), asked Pilate to have their legs broken and that they might be taken away.
\v 32 So the soldiers came, and they broke the legs of the first man who was crucified with Jesus, and then they broke the legs of the other man who was crucified alongside Him.
\v 33 But when they came to Jesus and saw that He was already dead, they did not break His legs.
\v 34 But one of the soldiers pierced His side with a spear, and immediately there came out blood and water.
\v 35 And he who saw it has borne witness, and his testimony is true; and he knows that he is telling the truth, so that you may also believe.
\v 36 For these things occurred so that the Scripture would be fulfilled: 'Not one of his bones shall be broken.'
\v 37 And again another scripture says: 'They will look upon the one whom they have pierced.'
\v 38 After these things, Joseph of Arimathea, who was a disciple of Jesus but secretly for fear of the Jews, asked Pilate that he might take away the body of Jesus; and Pilate gave him permission. So he came and took the body of Jesus.
\v 39 Nicodemus also came, the one who had gone to Jesus before by night, bringing a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about a hundred pounds.
\v 40 So they took the body of Jesus and bound it in linen cloths with the spices, as is the custom among the Jews for burial.
\v 41 Now in the place where He was crucified there was a garden, and in the garden a new tomb, in which no one had yet been laid.
\v 42 So they placed Jesus there because of the Jewish preparation day, for the tomb was nearby.
\c 20
\p
\v 1 On the first day of the week, Mary Magdalene came early, while it was still dark, to the tomb, and she saw that the stone had been taken away from the tomb.
\v 2 So she ran and went to Simon Peter and to the other disciple, the one whom Jesus loved, and said to them, ‘They have taken the Lord out of the tomb, and we do not know where they have laid Him.’
\v 3 Then Peter went out, along with the other disciple, and they headed towards the tomb.
\v 4 The two disciples ran together, but the other disciple outran Peter and reached the tomb first.
\v 5 And he bent down to look in and saw the linen cloths lying there, yet he did not go in.
\v 6 Then Simon Peter came, following him, and went into the tomb; he saw the linen cloths lying there.
\v 7 and the napkin that had been on His head was not lying with the linen cloths, but was folded up in a separate place.
\v 8 Then the other disciple, who had come first to the tomb, entered as well; and he saw and believed.
\v 9 For they had not yet understood the Scripture that he must rise from the dead.
\v 10 So the disciples went back to their own places.
\v 11 But Mary stood outside the tomb, weeping.
\v 12 And as she wept, she stooped down to look into the tomb, and she saw two angels in white sitting, one at the head and the other at the feet, where the body of Jesus had been laid.
\v 13 And they said to her, "Woman, why are you weeping?" She said to them, "Because they have taken away my Lord, and I do not know where they have laid Him."
\v 14 Having said this, she turned around and saw Jesus standing there, but she did not recognize that it was Jesus.
\v 15 Jesus said to her, 'Woman, why are you weeping? Whom are you seeking?' She, thinking Him to be the gardener, said to Him, 'Sir, if you have carried Him away, tell me where you have laid Him, and I will take Him away.'
\v 16 Jesus said to her, 'Mary.' Turning around, she said to Him, 'Rabboni!' (which means Teacher).
\v 17 Jesus said to her, 'Do not hold on to me, for I have not yet ascended to my Father. But go to my brothers and tell them, ‘I am ascending to my Father and your Father, to my God and your God.’
\v 18 Mary Magdalene came announcing to the disciples, ‘I have seen the Lord!’ And she told them the things he had said to her.
\v 19 On the evening of that day, the first day of the week, when the doors were locked where the disciples were gathered for fear of the Jews, Jesus came and stood among them and said to them, ‘Peace be with you.’
\v 20 And having said this, He showed them His hands and His side. The disciples rejoiced at seeing the Lord.
\v 21 Then Jesus said to them again, "Peace be with you. Just as the Father has sent Me, I am sending you."
\v 22 And when He had said this, He breathed on them and said, 'Receive the Holy Spirit.'
\v 23 If you forgive anyone's sins, they are forgiven; if you retain anyone's sins, they are retained.
\v 24 Now Thomas, one of the twelve, called the Twin, was not with them when Jesus came.
\v 25 So the other disciples told him, "We have seen the Lord!" But he said to them, "Unless I see the marks of the nails in his hands and put my finger into the nail marks and put my hand into his side, I will not believe."
\v 26 Eight days later, His disciples were again gathered inside, and Thomas was with them. Jesus came, though the doors were locked, and stood in the midst, and said, 'Peace be with you.'
\v 27 Then He said to Thomas, 'Put your finger here and see My hands; and put your hand here and place it in My side. Do not be faithless, but believe.'
\v 28 Thomas responded to Him, "My Lord and my God!"
\v 29 Jesus said to him, "Because you have seen Me, you have believed. Blessed are those who have not seen and yet have believed."
\v 30 Therefore, Jesus also performed many other signs in the presence of His disciples, which are not written in this book.
\v 31 But these things are written so that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that by believing, you may have life in His name.
\c 21
\p
\v 1 After these things, Jesus revealed Himself again to the disciples at the Sea of Tiberias; and He revealed Himself in this way.
\v 2 Simon Peter, Thomas (called the Twin), Nathanael from Cana in Galilee, the sons of Zebedee, and two others of His disciples were together.
\v 3 Simon Peter said to them, "I am going fishing." They said to him, "We will go with you." They went out and immediately got into the boat, and that night they caught nothing.
\v 4 But when morning had now come, Jesus stood on the shore; yet the disciples did not know that it was Jesus.
\v 5 Then Jesus said to them, "Children, do you have any fish?" They answered Him, "No."
\v 6 He said to them, 'Cast your net on the right side of the boat, and you will find some.' So they cast it, and now they were not able to haul it in because of the multitude of fish.
\v 7 Then that disciple, whom Jesus loved, said to Peter, 'It is the Lord!' As soon as Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord, he wrapped his outer garment around him (for he had taken it off) and jumped into the sea.
\v 8 The other disciples came in the boat, for they were not far from land, but about two hundred cubits away, dragging the net full of fish.
\v 9 When they had stepped onto the land, they saw a charcoal fire set up there, with fish laid upon it and bread.
\v 10 Jesus said to them, 'Bring some of the fish that you have just caught.'
\v 11 Simon Peter went up and drew the net to land, full of large fish, one hundred fifty-three; and although there were so many, the net was not broken.
\v 12 Jesus said to them, "Come and eat breakfast." None of the disciples dared to ask him, "Who are you?" They knew it was the Lord.
\v 13 Jesus came and took the bread, and gave it to them; and likewise the fish.
\v 14 This was now the third time that Jesus revealed himself to his disciples after he had risen from the dead.
\v 15 When they had finished eating, Jesus said to Simon Peter, 'Simon son of John, do you love me more than these?' He replied, 'Yes, Lord; you know that I have affection for you.' Jesus said to him, 'Feed my lambs.'
\v 16 He said to him a second time, 'Simon son of John, do you love me?' Peter answered, 'Yes, Lord; you know that I hold deep affection for you.' Jesus said to him, 'Tend my sheep.'
\v 17 He said to him the third time, 'Simon, son of John, do you love me?' Peter was grieved because He asked him the third time, 'Do you love me?' And he said to Him, 'Lord, you know all things; you know that I love you.' Jesus said to him, 'Feed my sheep.'
\v 18 Truly, truly, I say to you, when you were younger, you used to dress yourself and walk wherever you wished; but when you grow old, you will stretch out your hands, and another will gird you and carry you where you do not wish to go.
\v 19 This he said, signifying by what kind of death he would glorify God. And after saying this, he said to him, "Follow me."
\v 20 Turning around, Peter saw the disciple whom Jesus loved following them, the one who had leaned back against Jesus at the dinner and had said, 'Lord, who is it that is going to betray you?'
\v 21 When Peter saw him, he said to Jesus, 'Lord, what about this man?'
\v 22 Jesus said to him, "If I want him to remain until I come, what is that to you? You follow me!"
\v 23 Therefore, this saying spread among the brothers that this disciple would not die; yet Jesus did not say to him that he would not die, but, 'If I desire him to remain until I come, what is that to you?'
\v 24 This is the disciple who testifies about these things and has written them down. We know that his testimony is true.
\v 25 And there are also many other things that Jesus did, which if they were to be written one by one, I suppose that even the world itself could not contain the books that would be written. Amen.
