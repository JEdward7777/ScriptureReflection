\v 1 Paul, a servant of God and an apostle of Jesus Christ, for the faith of Godâ€™s chosen ones and the knowledge of the truth that leads to godliness.
\v 2 in hope of eternal life, which God, who cannot lie, promised before the ages began.
\v 3 But at the proper times He revealed His word through preaching, which I was entrusted with by the command of our Savior, God.
\v 4 To Titus, my true child in our common faith: Grace, mercy, and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Savior.
\v 5 For this reason, I left you in Crete, so that you might put what remains in order and appoint elders in every town, as I directed you.
\v 6 If anyone is blameless, the husband of one wife, having faithful children not accused of rebellion or disorder.
\v 7 For an overseer must be blameless, as a steward of God; not self-willed, not quick-tempered, not given to wine, not violent, not greedy for dishonest gain.
\v 8 But he must be hospitable, a lover of good, self-controlled, just, holy, and disciplined.
\v 9 He must hold firmly to the trustworthy message as it has been taught, so that he can encourage others by sound doctrine and refute those who oppose it.
\v 10 For there are many rebellious individuals, full of empty talk and deception, especially those of the circumcision.
\v 11 They must be silenced, for they are upsetting entire households by teaching things they ought not to teach for the sake of dishonest gain.
\v 12 One of them, a prophet from their own, has said, 'Cretans are always liars, evil beasts, lazy gluttons.'
\v 13 This testimony is true. Therefore, rebuke them sharply, so that they may be sound in the faith.
\v 14 not paying attention to Jewish myths and the commands of men who turn away from the truth.
\v 15 To the pure, all things are pure, but to those who are corrupted and unbelieving, nothing is pure; both their minds and consciences are defiled.
\v 16 They profess to know God, but by their deeds they deny Him, being detestable, disobedient, and worthless for every good work.
\c 2
\p
\v 1 But as for you, speak the things which are fitting for sound doctrine.
\v 2 Older men are to be temperate, dignified, self-controlled, sound in faith, in love, and in steadfastness.
\v 3 Likewise, older women are to be reverent in behavior, not slanderers or slaves to much wine, but teachers of good things.
\v 4 that they may teach the young women to be sensible, to love their husbands, and to love their children.
\v 5 to be discreet, pure, keepers at home, kind, and submissive to their own husbands, so that the word of God may not be blasphemed.
\v 6 In the same way, encourage the young men to be self-controlled.
\v 7 In all things, show yourself to be a model of good works; in your teaching, exhibit integrity, dignity, and incorruptibility.
\v 8 and sound speech that cannot be condemned, so that those who oppose you may be ashamed, having nothing evil to say about us.
\v 9 Slaves are to be submissive to their own masters in everything, aiming to be pleasing and not argumentative.
\v 10 not pilfering, but showing all good faith, so that in everything they may adorn the doctrine of our Savior, God.
\v 11 For the grace of God that brings salvation has appeared to all men.
\v 12 Instructing us to deny ungodliness and worldly desires, and to live soberly, righteously, and godly in the present age.
\v 13 awaiting our blessed hope, the glorious appearing of our great God and Savior, Jesus Christ.
\v 14 Who gave Himself for us, to redeem us from all lawlessness and to purify for Himself a people who are His very own, eager to do good works.
\v 15 Declare these things; exhort and rebuke with all authority. Let no one disregard you.
\c 3
\p
\v 1 Remind them to be submissive to rulers and authorities, to be obedient, and to be ready for every good work.
\v 2 to speak evil of no one, to be peaceable, gentle, showing all humility toward all men.
\v 3 For we ourselves were once foolish, disobedient, led astray, slaves to various passions and pleasures, passing our days in malice and envy, hated by others and hating one another.
\v 4 But when the goodness and loving kindness of our God and Savior appeared,
\v 5 He saved us, not because of any righteous deeds we had done, but according to His own mercy, through the washing of regeneration and renewing of the Holy Spirit.
\v 6 He generously poured out His Spirit on us through Jesus Christ our Savior.
\v 7 So that being justified by His grace, we might become heirs according to the hope of eternal life.
\v 8 This is a faithful saying, and I want you to affirm strongly regarding these matters, so that those who have believed in God may be careful to engage in good works. These things are good and profitable for all people.
\v 9 But avoid foolish disputes, genealogies, arguments, and quarrels about the Law; for they are unprofitable and worthless.
\v 10 Reject a divisive person after the first and second admonition.
\v 11 knowing that such a person is warped and sinful; they are self-condemned.
\v 12 When I send Artemas or Tychicus to you, make every effort to come to me in Nicopolis, for I have decided to spend the winter there.
\v 13 Send Zenas the lawyer and Apollos on their way diligently, so that nothing may be lacking for them.
\v 14 And let our people learn to engage in good deeds to meet urgent needs, so that they will not be unfruitful.
\v 15 All who are with me send you greetings. Greet those who love us in faith. Grace be with all of you.
