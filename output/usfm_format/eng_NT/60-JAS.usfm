\v 1 James, a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ, to the twelve tribes scattered among the nations: Greetings.
\v 2 Consider it pure joy, my brothers and sisters, whenever you face trials of many kinds.
\v 3 Knowing that the testing of your faith produces patience.
\v 4 But let patience have its full effect, so that you may be perfect and complete, lacking in nothing.
\v 5 If any of you lacks wisdom, let him ask of God, who gives generously to all without finding fault, and it will be given to him.
\v 6 But let him ask in faith, with no doubting; for he who doubts is like a wave of the sea, driven and tossed by the wind.
\v 7 For let not that man suppose that he will receive anything from the Lord.
\v 8 A double-minded man is unstable in all his ways.
\v 9 But let the lowly brother boast in his exaltation.
\v 10 But the rich should take pride in their humiliation, because like a wildflower, they will pass away.
\v 11 For the sun rises with scorching heat and withers the grass; its flower falls and the beauty of its appearance perishes. So also will the rich fade away in the midst of their pursuits.
\v 12 Blessed is the man who endures temptation; for when he has stood the test, he will receive the crown of life that the Lord has promised to those who love Him.
\v 13 Let no one who is being tempted say, 'I am being tempted by God,' for God cannot be tempted by evil, nor does He Himself tempt anyone.
\v 14 But each person is tempted when he is drawn away and enticed by his own desire.
\v 15 Then, when desire has fully conceived, it gives birth to sin; and sin, when it is fully grown, brings forth death.
\v 16 Do not be misled, my beloved brothers; 
\v 17 Every good gift and every perfect blessing is from above, coming down from the Father of lights, with whom there is no variation or shadow due to change.
\v 18 Of His own will He brought us forth by the word of truth, that we should be a kind of firstfruits of His creatures.
\v 19 Therefore, my beloved brothers, let every person be quick to listen, slow to speak, and slow to anger.
\v 20 For the anger of man does not produce the righteousness of God.
\v 21 Therefore, laying aside all filthiness and abundance of wickedness, with meekness receive the implanted Word, which is able to save your souls.
\v 22 But be doers of the word, and not merely hearers, deceiving yourselves.
\v 23 For if anyone is a hearer of the word and not a doer, he is like a man observing his natural face in a mirror;.
\v 24 For he observed himself, went away, and immediately forgot what kind of man he was.
\v 25 But he who looks into the perfect law of liberty and perseveres, not being a forgetful hearer but a doer of the work, this man will be blessed in what he does.
\v 26 If anyone thinks himself to be religious and does not bridle his tongue, but deceives his own heart, this one's religion is worthless.
\v 27 Pure and undefiled religion before God the Father is this: to visit orphans and widows in their affliction, and to keep oneself unblemished from the world.

\v 1 My brothers and sisters, do not hold your faith in our glorious Lord Jesus Christ with partiality.
\v 2 For if there should come into your assembly a man with a gold ring, dressed in splendid clothes, and also there comes in a poor man in filthy garments,
\v 3 And if you pay attention to the one wearing the fine clothing and say, 'You sit here in a good place,' but to the poor man you say, 'You stand there' or 'Sit here at my feet,'
\v 4 Have you not then made distinctions among yourselves and become judges with evil thoughts?
\v 5 Listen, my beloved brothers. Has not God chosen the poor of this world to be rich in faith and heirs of the kingdom which He promised to those who love Him?
\v 6 But you have dishonored the poor man. Do not the rich oppress you and drag you into courts?
\v 7 Are they not the ones who blaspheme the honorable name by which you are called?
\v 8 If you truly fulfill the royal law according to the Scripture, ‘You shall love your neighbor as yourself,’ you are doing well.
\v 9 But if you show favoritism, you commit sin and are convicted by the law as transgressors.
\v 10 For whoever keeps the whole law but stumbles at just one point is guilty of breaking all of it.
\v 11 For He who said, 'You shall not commit adultery,' also said, 'You shall not murder.' If you do not commit adultery but you murder, you have become a lawbreaker.
\v 12 So speak and act as those who are to be judged under the law of liberty.
\v 13 For judgment is without mercy to the one who has shown no mercy. Mercy triumphs over judgment.
\v 14 What good is it, my brothers, if someone claims to have faith but does not have works? Can that faith save him?
\v 15 If a brother or sister is without clothing and lacks daily food,
\v 16 And if someone says to them, 'Go in peace, be warm and filled,' yet does not provide for their physical needs, what good is that?
\v 17 So also faith, if it does not have works, is dead by itself.
\v 18 But someone will say, 'You have faith, and I have works.' Show me your faith apart from your works, and I will show you my faith by my works.
\v 19 You believe that God is one; you do well. Even the demons believe—and shudder.
\v 20 But do you want to know, O foolish man, that faith without works is dead?
\v 21 Was not our father Abraham justified by works when he offered Isaac his son on the altar?
\v 22 You see that faith was active together with his works, and by works, faith was brought to completion.
\v 23 And the Scripture was fulfilled that says, 'Abraham believed God, and it was credited to him as righteousness,' and he was called a friend of God.
\v 24 You see that a person is justified by works and not by faith alone.
\v 25 In the same way, was not Rahab the harlot also justified by her actions when she welcomed the spies and sent them out by another way?
\v 26 For just as the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without deeds is also dead.

\v 1 Not many of you should become teachers, my brothers, because you know that we who teach will be judged more strictly.
\v 2 For we all stumble in many ways. And if anyone does not stumble in what he says, he is a perfect man, able to control his whole body.
\v 3 Consider the horses; we put bits in their mouths to guide them, and with them, we can steer their entire body.
\v 4 Look at the ships; though they are so large and driven by fierce winds, they are turned about by a very small rudder wherever the helmsman desires.
\v 5 So also the tongue is a small member, yet it boasts of great things. Behold, how great a forest is set ablaze by such a small fire!
\v 6 And the tongue is a fire, the world of iniquity. Thus, the tongue can defile the whole body and set ablaze the course of our lives, being ignited by hell.
\v 7 For every kind of beast and bird, reptile and sea creature, can be tamed and has been tamed by mankind's nature.
\v 8 But no human being can tame the tongue; it is a restless evil, full of deadly poison.
\v 9 With it we bless our Lord and Father, and with it we curse people made in the likeness of God.
\v 10 From the same mouth come both blessing and cursing. My brothers, this should not be so.
\v 11 Does a spring pour forth from the same opening both fresh and bitter water?
\v 12 My brothers, can a fig tree bear olives, or a grapevine produce figs? Neither can a salt spring yield fresh water.
\v 13 Who among you is wise and understanding? Let them show it by their good life, by deeds done in the humility that comes from wisdom.
\v 14 But if you harbor bitter envy and selfish ambition in your hearts, do not boast about it or deny the truth.
\v 15 This wisdom is not that which comes down from above, but is earthly, unspiritual, and demonic.
\v 16 For where jealousy and selfish ambition exist, there is disorder and every vile practice.
\v 17 But the wisdom that comes from above is first pure, then peace-loving, considerate, submissive, full of mercy and good fruit, impartial and sincere.
\v 18 And the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace by those who make peace.

\v 1 What causes conflicts and quarrels among you? Is it not your passions that wage war within you?
\v 2 You desire but do not have; you kill and covet, but you cannot obtain; you fight and quarrel. You do not have because you do not ask.
\v 3 You ask, and yet you do not receive, because you ask with wrong motives, so that you may spend it on your pleasures.
\v 4 You adulterous people! Don’t you know that friendship with the world means enmity against God? Therefore, anyone who chooses to be a friend of the world becomes an enemy of God.
\v 5 Or do you think that the Scripture says without reason, 'He yearns jealously for the spirit He has caused to dwell in us'?
\v 6 But He gives a greater grace. Therefore it says, 'God opposes the proud, but gives grace to the humble.'
\v 7 Therefore, submit yourselves to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you.
\v 8 Draw near to God, and He will draw near to you. Cleanse your hands, you sinners, and purify your hearts, you double-minded.
\v 9 Be afflicted, and mourn, and weep; let your laughter be turned to mourning, and your joy to heaviness.
\v 10 Humble yourselves in the presence of the Lord, and He will lift you up.
\v 11 Do not speak against one another, brothers. The one who speaks against a brother or judges his brother speaks against the law and judges the law. But if you judge the law, you are not a doer of the law but a judge.
\v 12 There is only one Lawgiver and Judge, the one who has the power to save and to destroy. But who are you to judge your neighbor?
\v 13 Come now, you who say, 'Today or tomorrow we will go into this city and spend a year there, and trade and make a profit.'
\v 14 Yet you do not know what tomorrow will bring. For what is your life? It is a mist that appears for a little while and then vanishes.
\v 15 Instead, you ought to say, 'If the Lord wills, we will live and do this or that.'
\v 16 But now you boast in your arrogance; all such boasting is evil.
\v 17 Therefore, to know the good that one ought to do and not to do it, is sin for that person.

\v 1 Come now, you rich, weep and wail for the miseries that are coming upon you!
\v 2 Your wealth has rotted, and your garments are moth-eaten.
\v 3 Your gold and silver are corroded, and their corrosion will be a testimony against you and will eat your flesh like fire. You have laid up treasure in the last days.
\v 4 Behold, the wages of the laborers who harvested your fields, which you kept back by fraud, cry out; and the cries of the reapers have reached the ears of the Lord of hosts.
\v 5 You have lived luxuriously on the earth and indulged yourselves; you have fattened your hearts in a day of slaughter.
\v 6 You have condemned and murdered the righteous one; he does not resist you.
\v 7 Therefore, brothers, be patient until the coming of the Lord. See how the farmer waits for the precious fruit of the earth, being patient for it until he receives the early and late rains.
\v 8 You also, be patient; strengthen your hearts, for the coming of the Lord is near.
\v 9 Do not grumble against one another, brothers, lest you be judged; behold, the Judge is standing at the door.
\v 10 As examples of suffering and patience, brothers, take the prophets who spoke in the name of the Lord.
\v 11 Indeed, we consider those blessed who have persevered. You have heard of the endurance of Job, and you have seen the outcome that the Lord brought about—how the Lord is full of compassion and mercy.
\v 12 Above all, my brothers, do not swear, either by heaven or by earth or by any other oath; but let your yes be yes, and your no be no, so that you may not fall under judgment.
\v 13 Is anyone among you suffering? Let him pray. Is anyone cheerful? Let him sing praise.
\v 14 Is anyone among you sick? Let him call for the elders of the church, and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord.
\v 15 And the prayer offered in faith will heal the sick, and the Lord will raise him up; and if he has committed sins, they will be forgiven him.
\v 16 Therefore, confess your sins to one another and pray for each other, so that you may be healed. The prayer of a righteous person is powerful and effective.
\v 17 Elijah was a man with a nature like ours, and he fervently prayed that it would not rain; and it did not rain on the earth for three years and six months.
\v 18 And again he prayed, and the heavens gave rain, and the earth yielded its fruit.
\v 19 Brothers, if anyone among you wanders from the truth and someone brings him back,
\v 20 Let him know that whoever turns a sinner back from the error of his way will save a soul from death and will cover a multitude of sins.
