\v 1 Paul and Timothy, servants of Christ Jesus, to all the saints in Christ Jesus who are at Philippi, with the overseers and deacons.
\v 2 Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
\v 3 I thank my God for every remembrance of you.
\v 4 In every prayer of mine, for all of you, I always pray with joy.
\v 5 because of your partnership in the Gospel from the very first day until now.
\v 6 I am confident of this very thing, that He who began a good work in you will carry it on to completion until the day of Jesus Christ.
\v 7 It is right for me to think this way about all of you, because I have you in my heart; for whether I am in chains or defending and confirming the gospel, you all share in God’s grace with me.
\v 8 For God is my witness, how I long for all of you with the tender affection of Christ Jesus.
\v 9 And this is my prayer: that your love may abound more and more in knowledge and all discernment.
\v 10 so that you may be able to discern what is best, and may be pure and blameless for the day of Christ.
\v 11 filled with the fruits of righteousness that come through Jesus Christ, to the glory and praise of God.
\v 12 I want you to know, brothers, that what has happened to me has really served to advance the gospel.
\v 13 So that my chains have become known throughout the entire imperial guard and to all the others in Christ.
\v 14 And most of the brothers, having confidence in the Lord because of my chains, are now more boldly proclaiming the word without fear.
\v 15 Some indeed preach Christ out of envy and rivalry, but others out of goodwill.
\v 16 The former preach Christ out of selfish ambition, not sincerely, thinking to afflict me in my imprisonment.
\v 17 But the latter preach Christ out of love, knowing that I am put here for the defense of the gospel.
\v 18 What then? Only that in every way, whether in pretense or in truth, Christ is proclaimed; and in this I rejoice, yes, and I will rejoice.
\v 19 For I know that this will turn out for my deliverance through your prayers and the support of the Spirit of Jesus Christ.
\v 20 According to my eager expectation and hope, I will not be ashamed in anything, but with all boldness, as always, Christ will be magnified in my body, whether by life or by death.
\v 21 For to me, to live is Christ, and to die is gain.
\v 22 But if living in the flesh means fruitful labor for me, then I do not know which I would choose.
\v 23 But I am torn between the two; I long to depart and be with Christ, which is far better.
\v 24 But to remain in the flesh is more necessary for your sake.
\v 25 And being confident of this, I know that I will remain and continue with all of you for your progress and joy in the faith,
\v 26 so that your boast may abound in Christ Jesus through my coming to you again.
\v 27 Only let your lives be worthy of the gospel of Christ, so that whether I come and see you or am absent, I may hear of your affairs, that you stand firm in one spirit, striving together with one mind for the faith of the gospel.
\v 28 And not being frightened in any way by those who oppose you; this is a clear sign to them of their destruction, but of your salvation, and that from God.
\v 29 For to you it has been granted on behalf of Christ, not only to believe in Him but also to suffer for His sake.
\v 30 Engaging in the same struggle, as you saw in me and now hear about in me.
\c 2
\p
\v 1 Therefore, if there is any encouragement in Christ, any comfort from love, any participation in the Spirit, any affection and sympathy,
\v 2 Complete my joy by being of the same mind, having the same love, being in full accord and of one mind.
\v 3 Do nothing from selfish ambition or conceit, but in humility count others more significant than yourselves.
\v 4 Let each of you not only look to your own interests, but also to the interests of others.
\v 5 Let this mindset be in you which was also in Christ Jesus.
\v 6 Who, existing in the very nature of God, did not consider equality with God something to be used for His own advantage.
\v 7 but emptied Himself, taking on the form of a servant, being made in the likeness of men.
\v 8 And being found in appearance as a man, he humbled himself by becoming obedient to the point of death, even death on a cross.
\v 9 Therefore, God also exalted Him to the highest place and granted Him the name that is above every name.
\v 10 That at the name of Jesus, every knee should bow, in heaven and on earth and under the earth.
\v 11 And every tongue will confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.
\v 12 Therefore, my beloved, as you have always obeyed, not only in my presence but now much more in my absence, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling.
\v 13 For it is God who is at work within you, enabling both your desire and your ability to fulfill His good purpose.
\v 14 Do everything without complaining or arguing.
\v 15 so that you may become blameless and pure, children of God without fault in a crooked and depraved generation, in which you shine like stars in the universe.
\v 16 Holding fast to the word of life, so that I may boast on the day of Christ that I did not run in vain or labor in vain.
\v 17 But even if I am being poured out like a drink offering on the sacrifice and service of your faith, I rejoice and share my joy with all of you.
\v 18 In the same way, you also should rejoice and celebrate with me.
\v 19 But I hope in the Lord Jesus to send Timothy to you soon, so that I may also be cheered by news of you.
\v 20 For I have no one else of equal soul who will genuinely care for your welfare.
\v 21 For all seek their own interests, not those of Christ Jesus.
\v 22 But you know his proven character, that as a son with a father, he has served with me in the work of the gospel.
\v 23 Therefore, I hope to send him as soon as I see how things go with me.
\v 24 And I have confidence in the Lord that I will come to you quickly.
\v 25 But I thought it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus, my brother and fellow worker and companion in arms, and your messenger and minister to my needs.
\v 26 For he has been longing for all of you and is distressed because he heard that you were sick.
\v 27 Indeed, he was ill and close to death; but God had mercy on him, and not only on him, but also on me, to spare me sorrow upon sorrow.
\v 28 Therefore, I am all the more eager to send him, so that when you see him again, you may rejoice, and I may be less anxious.
\v 29 So receive him in the Lord with all joy, and honor such men.
\v 30 For he came close to death for the work of Christ, risking his life to supply what was lacking in your service to me.
\c 3
\p
\v 1 Finally, my brothers, rejoice in the Lord. To write the same things to you is no trouble to me, and it is a safeguard for you.
\v 2 Beware of the dogs, beware of the evil workers, beware of the mutilation!
\v 3 For we are the true circumcision, who worship God in the Spirit, rejoice in Christ Jesus, and place no confidence in the flesh.
\v 4 Though I myself have reason for confidence in the flesh. If anyone thinks he has reason for confidence in the flesh, I have more:
\v 5 Circumcised on the eighth day, of the nation of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, a Hebrew born of Hebrews; according to the law, a Pharisee.
\v 6 As for zeal, I was a persecutor of the church; as for righteousness based on the law, I was faultless.
\v 7 But whatever gains I had, these I now consider a loss because of Christ.
\v 8 Indeed, I consider everything a loss because of the surpassing worth of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord. For his sake, I have suffered the loss of all things and count them as rubbish, that I may gain Christ.
\v 9 and be found in Him, not having my own righteousness that comes from the law, but that which is through faith in Christ, the righteousness from God that depends on faith.
\v 10 that I may know Him and the power of His resurrection, and may share in His sufferings, becoming like Him in His death,
\v 11 if by any means I might attain to the resurrection of the dead.
\v 12 Not that I have already obtained it, or have already reached perfection; but I press on to take hold of that for which Christ Jesus took hold of me.
\v 13 Brothers, I do not consider myself to have fully grasped it yet; but one thing I do: forgetting what lies behind and straining forward to what lies ahead.
\v 14 I press on toward the goal for the prize of the upward call of God in Christ Jesus, forgetting what lies behind and straining forward to what lies ahead.
\v 15 Therefore, let those of us who are mature think this way; and if in anything you think otherwise, God will reveal that also to you.
\v 16 Nevertheless, let us hold firm to the standard we have attained, and let us think with the same mind.
\v 17 Brothers, be imitators of me, and observe those who walk according to the example you have in us.
\v 18 For many walk, of whom I have often told you and now tell you even with tears, that they are enemies of the cross of Christ.
\v 19 Their end is destruction; their god is their belly, and they glory in their shame, with minds set on earthly things.
\v 20 For our citizenship is in heaven, from which we also eagerly await a Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ.
\v 21 who will transform our humble body to be like His glorious body, by the power that enables Him even to subject all things to Himself.
\c 4
\p
\v 1 Therefore, my beloved and longed-for brethren, my joy and crown, stand firm thus in the Lord, beloved.
\v 2 I urge Euodia and I urge Syntyche to think the same way in the Lord.
\v 3 Yes, I ask you also, true companion, help these women who have contended at my side in the cause of the gospel, along with Clement and the rest of my fellow workers, whose names are in the book of life.
\v 4 Rejoice in the Lord always; again I will say, rejoice.
\v 5 Let your gentle spirit be known to all men. The Lord is near.
\v 6 Do not be anxious about anything, but in every situation, by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving, let your requests be made known to God.
\v 7 And the peace of God, which surpasses all understanding, will guard your hearts and your thoughts in Christ Jesus.
\v 8 Finally, brothers and sisters, whatever is true, whatever is noble, whatever is right, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is admirable—if anything is excellent or praiseworthy—think about such things.
\v 9 Whatever you have learned and received and heard and seen in me—put these things into practice, and the God of peace will be with you.
\v 10 I greatly rejoiced in the Lord that now at last you have revived your concern for me. Indeed, you were concerned, but you lacked the opportunity to show it.
\v 11 Not that I speak out of need, for I have learned to be content in whatever situation I find myself.
\v 12 I know how to be abased, and I know how to abound. In every circumstance, I have learned both to be full and to be hungry, to abound and to suffer need.
\v 13 I am able to do all things through Christ who empowers me.
\v 14 Nevertheless, you have done well to share in my affliction.
\v 15 You also know, O Philippians, that in the very beginning of the gospel, when I left Macedonia, no church shared with me in the matter of giving and receiving except you alone.
\v 16 For even in Thessalonica, you sent me help more than once for my needs.
\v 17 Not that I seek the gift itself, but I seek the abundant fruit that increases to your account.
\v 18 But I have received everything in full, and I abound. I am fully supplied, having received from Epaphroditus the gifts you sent, a fragrant aroma, an acceptable sacrifice, well-pleasing to God.
\v 19 And my God will fully supply your every need according to His riches in glory in Christ Jesus.
\v 20 To our God and Father be glory forever and ever. Amen.
\v 21 Greet every saint in Christ Jesus. The brothers who are with me send their greetings to you.
\v 22 All the saints send their greetings to you, especially those from the household of Caesar.
\v 23 The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with all of you. Amen.
