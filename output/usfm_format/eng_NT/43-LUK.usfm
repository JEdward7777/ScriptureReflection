\v 1 Inasmuch as many have undertaken to compile a narrative of the events that have been fulfilled among us,
\v 2 just as those who from the beginning were eyewitnesses and ministers of the word delivered them to us,
\v 3 It seemed good to me, having closely followed all things from the beginning, to write to you in orderly fashion, most excellent Theophilus,
\v 4 so that you may have certainty concerning the things you have been taught.
\v 5 In the days when Herod was king of Judea, there was a certain priest named Zechariah, belonging to the division of Abijah; and his wife was from the daughters of Aaron, and her name was Elizabeth.
\v 6 Both were righteous in the sight of God, walking blamelessly in all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord.
\v 7 But they had no child, because Elizabeth was barren, and they were both advanced in age.
\v 8 Now it happened that while he was serving as a priest before God in the order of his division,
\v 9 according to the custom of the priesthood, he was chosen by lot to enter the temple of the Lord and burn incense.
\v 10 And the whole multitude of the people was praying outside at the hour of incense.
\v 11 And an angel of the Lord appeared to him, standing at the right side of the altar of incense.
\v 12 And Zacharias was troubled when he saw the angel, and fear fell upon him.
\v 13 But the angel said to him, 'Do not be afraid, Zacharias; for your prayer has been heard, and your wife Elizabeth will bear you a son, and you shall call his name John.'
\v 14 And you will have joy and gladness, and many will rejoice at his birth.
\v 15 For he will be great in the sight of the Lord; he will not drink wine or strong drink, and he will be filled with the Holy Spirit even from his mother’s womb.
\v 16 And he will turn many of the children of Israel back to the Lord their God.
\v 17 And he will go before Him in the spirit and power of Elijah, to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children and the disobedient to the wisdom of the just, to make ready a people prepared for the Lord.
\v 18 And Zechariah said to the angel, "How shall I know this? For I am an old man, and my wife is advanced in years."
\v 19 And the angel answered him, 'I am Gabriel, who stands in the presence of God, and I was sent to speak to you and to bring you this good news.'
\v 20 And behold, you will be silent and unable to speak until the day these things take place, because you did not believe my words, which will be fulfilled in their time.
\v 21 Meanwhile, the people were waiting for Zechariah, and they marveled that he stayed so long in the temple.
\v 22 Upon exiting, he was unable to speak to them, and they understood that he had seen a vision in the temple; he remained mute, gesturing to them.
\v 23 And it came to pass that when the days of his ministry were fulfilled, he departed to his own house.
\v 24 After those days, his wife Elizabeth conceived, and she kept herself hidden for five months.
\v 25 She said, 'Thus the Lord has done for me in the days when He looked upon me to take away my reproach among people.'
\v 26 In the sixth month, the angel Gabriel was sent from God to a city of Galilee named Nazareth,
\v 27 to a virgin pledged to be married to a man named Joseph, of the house of David; and the virgin’s name was Mary.
\v 28 And the angel entered to her and said, 'Rejoice, favored one! The Lord is with you; blessed are you among women.'
\v 29 But she was greatly troubled at his word, and wondered what kind of greeting this might be.
\v 30 And the angel said to her, 'Do not be afraid, Mary, for you have found favor with God.'
\v 31 And behold, you will conceive in your womb and bear a son, and you shall call his name Jesus.
\v 32 He will be great, and he will be called the Son of the Most High; and the Lord God will give him the throne of his father David.
\v 33 And he will reign over the house of Jacob forever, and of his kingdom there will be no end.
\v 34 And Mary said to the angel, "How will this happen, since I am a virgin?"
\v 35 And the angel answered her, 'The Holy Spirit will come upon you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you; therefore, the one to be born will be called holy, the Son of God.'
\v 36 And behold, your relative Elizabeth has also conceived a son in her old age, and this is the sixth month for her who was called barren.
\v 37 For nothing will be impossible with God.
\v 38 Then Mary said, 'Behold, I am the servant of the Lord; let it be to me according to your word.' And the angel departed from her.
\v 39 In those days, Mary arose and went with haste to the hill country, to a city of Judah.
\v 40 And she entered the house of Zacharias and greeted Elizabeth.
\v 41 And when Elizabeth heard the greeting of Mary, the baby leaped in her womb; and Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit.
\v 42 And she cried out with a loud voice and said, "Blessed are you among women, and blessed is the fruit of your womb!"
\v 43 But why am I so favored, that the mother of my Lord should come to me?
\v 44 For behold, as soon as the sound of your greeting reached my ears, the baby leaped in joy within my womb.
\v 45 And blessed is she who has believed that what the Lord has spoken to her will be fulfilled.
\v 46 And Mary said, "My soul magnifies the Lord.
\v 47 and my spirit exults in God my Savior,
\v 48 For He has looked with favor upon the humble state of His servant. Behold, from now on, all generations will call me blessed.
\v 49 For the Mighty One has done great things for me, and holy is His name.
\v 50 And His mercy is for generations upon generations for those who revere Him.
\v 51 He has displayed His might with His arm; He has scattered those who are proud in the thoughts of their hearts.
\v 52 He has toppled the powerful from their thrones and has raised up the humble.
\v 53 He has filled the hungry with good things, but the rich He has sent away empty.
\v 54 He has taken hold of His servant Israel, to remember His mercy.
\v 55 just as He spoke to our ancestors, to Abraham and his descendants forever.
\v 56 And Mary stayed with her about three months, and returned to her home.
\v 57 Now the time came for Elizabeth to give birth, and she bore a son.
\v 58 And the neighbors and relatives heard that the Lord had shown great mercy to her, and they rejoiced with her.
\v 59 And it came to pass on the eighth day that they came to circumcise the child, and they called him by the name of his father, Zechariah.
\v 60 And his mother answered, saying, "No, he shall be called John."
\v 61 And they said to her, 'There is no one among your relatives who is called by this name.'
\v 62 They made signs to his father, asking what he would have him called.
\v 63 And he asked for a writing tablet and wrote, saying, 'His name is John.' And they all marveled.
\v 64 And immediately his mouth was opened, and his tongue was loosed, and he spoke, blessing God.
\v 65 And there came fear upon all who lived around them, and throughout all the hilly region of Judea, these matters were spoken of extensively.
\v 66 And all who heard these things pondered in their hearts, saying, 'What then will this child be?' For the hand of the Lord was with him.
\v 67 And his father Zechariah was filled with the Holy Spirit and prophesied, saying,
\v 68 Blessed be the Lord God of Israel, for He has visited and brought redemption to His people.
\v 69 And He has raised up a mighty horn of salvation for us in the house of His servant David.
\v 70 just as He spoke by the mouth of His holy prophets, who have been since the world began.
\v 71 salvation from our enemies, and from the hand of all who hate us,
\v 72 to show mercy to our fathers, and to remember His holy covenant.
\v 73 the oath He swore to our forefather Abraham, to grant us.
\v 74 to grant us, that we, being delivered from the hand of our enemies, might serve Him without fear.
\v 75 in holiness and righteousness before Him all the days of our life.
\v 76 And you, child, will be called the prophet of the Most High; for you will go before the Lord to prepare His ways.
\v 77 to give knowledge of salvation to His people by the forgiveness of their sins.
\v 78 Because of the tender mercy of our God, with which the rising sun will visit us from on high,
\v 79 to shine upon those who sit in darkness and in the shadow of death, to guide our feet into the way of peace.
\v 80 And the child grew and became strong in spirit, and he was in the wilderness until the day of his manifestation to Israel.

\p
\v 1 In those days, a decree went out from Caesar Augustus that all the inhabited earth should be registered.
\v 2 This was the first registration that took place while Quirinius was governing Syria.
\v 3 And all were going to be registered, each to his own city.
\v 4 And Joseph also went up from Galilee, out of the city of Nazareth, to Judea, to the city of David, which is called Bethlehem, because he was of the house and lineage of David.
\v 5 to register along with Mary, his betrothed wife, who was with child.
\v 6 And while they were there, the days were completed for her to give birth.
\v 7 And she gave birth to her firstborn son, and wrapped him in swaddling cloths, and laid him in a manger, because there was no room for them in the inn.
\v 8 And there were shepherds in the same region, staying out in the fields and keeping watch over their flock by night.
\v 9 And behold, an angel of the Lord stood before them, and the glory of the Lord shone around them, and they were greatly afraid.
\v 10 But the angel said to them, 'Do not be afraid; for behold, I bring you good news of great joy that will be for all the people.'
\v 11 For today in the city of David, a Savior has been born for you, who is Christ the Lord.
\v 12 And this will be the sign for you: You will find a newborn baby wrapped in swaddling clothes and lying in a manger.
\v 13 And suddenly, there appeared with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host praising God and saying,
\v 14 Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace among those with whom he is pleased.
\v 15 And it came to pass, when the angels had departed from them into heaven, the shepherds said to one another, "Let us go now to Bethlehem and see this thing that has been made known to us by the Lord."
\v 16 And they hurriedly went and found Mary and Joseph, and the baby lying in the manger.
\v 17 And when they saw it, they made known the saying that had been told to them concerning this child.
\v 18 And all who heard it were amazed at what the shepherds told them.
\v 19 But Mary treasured up all these words, pondering them in her heart.
\v 20 And the shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all the things they had heard and seen, which were just as they had been told.
\v 21 And when the eight days were fulfilled for the circumcising of the child, his name was called Jesus, which was given by the angel before he was conceived in the womb.
\v 22 And when the days of their purification according to the law of Moses were completed, they brought him up to Jerusalem to present him to the Lord.
\v 23 as it is written in the Law of the Lord, ‘Every male that opens the womb shall be called holy to the Lord.’
\v 24 and to offer a sacrifice in accordance with what is said in the Law of the Lord: 'a pair of turtledoves or two young pigeons.'
\v 25 And behold, there was a man in Jerusalem, whose name was Simeon, and this man was righteous and devout, awaiting the consolation of Israel; and the Holy Spirit was upon him.
\v 26 And it had been revealed to him by the Holy Spirit that he would not see death before he had seen the Lord's Christ.
\v 27 And he came into the temple in the Spirit; and when the parents brought in the child Jesus to do for him according to the custom of the Law,
\v 28 He took Him up in his arms, blessed God, and said,
\v 29 Now, Sovereign Lord, you can dismiss your servant in peace, just as you have promised.
\v 30 For my eyes have seen your salvation,
\v 31 which You have prepared in the presence of all nations,
\v 32 a light for revelation to the Gentiles, and the glory of Your people Israel.
\v 33 And Joseph and His mother were astonished at the things being said about Him.
\v 34 And Simeon blessed them and said to Mary, His mother, 'Behold, this child is destined for the fall and the rising of many in Israel, and for a sign that will be opposed.'
\v 35 And a sword will pierce your own soul, so that the thoughts of many hearts may be revealed.
\v 36 And there was a prophetess, Anna, the daughter of Phanuel, of the tribe of Asher; she was advanced in years, having lived with a husband for seven years from her virginity,
\v 37 and this woman was a widow of eighty-four years, who did not depart from the temple, serving God with fastings and prayers, night and day.
\v 38 And at that very moment, she came up and began to give thanks to the Lord and spoke about Him to all who were waiting for the redemption of Jerusalem.
\v 39 And when they had completed everything in accordance with the Law of the Lord, they returned to Galilee, to their own city of Nazareth.
\v 40 And the child grew and became strong in spirit, filled with wisdom, and the grace of God was upon him.
\v 41 Now his parents went to Jerusalem every year for the feast of Passover.
\v 42 And when he was twelve years old, they went up to Jerusalem according to the custom of the feast.
\v 43 And when they had completed the days of the feast, as they were returning, Jesus, the child, remained behind in Jerusalem, and Joseph and his mother did not know it.
\v 44 But thinking that he was in their company, they traveled for a day’s journey; then they began to search for him among their relatives and acquaintances.
\v 45 And not finding him, they returned to Jerusalem, searching for him.
\v 46 After three days, they found him in the temple, sitting among the teachers, listening to them and asking them questions.
\v 47 And all who heard him were astonished at his understanding and his answers.
\v 48 And when they saw him, they were amazed, and his mother said to him, 'Child, why have you treated us like this? Behold, your father and I have been searching for you in great distress.'
\v 49 And He said to them, 'Why were you searching for Me? Did you not know that I must be in my Father's house?'
\v 50 And they did not comprehend the statement He had made to them.
\v 51 And He went down with them and came to Nazareth, and was obedient to them. And His mother kept all these sayings in her heart.
\v 52 And Jesus increased in wisdom and stature, and in favor with God and man.

\p
\v 1 In the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar, when Pontius Pilate was governor of Judea, and Herod was tetrarch of Galilee, his brother Philip was tetrarch of the region of Ituraea and Trachonitis, and Lysanias was tetrarch of Abilene,
\v 2 during the high priesthood of Annas and Caiaphas, the word of God came to John the son of Zacharias in the wilderness.
\v 3 And he went throughout all the region around the Jordan, proclaiming a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins.
\v 4 As it is written in the book of the words of the prophet Isaiah, saying: 'A voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare the way of the Lord, make His paths straight;'
\v 5 Every valley shall be filled, and every mountain and hill shall be made low; the crooked places shall be made straight, and the rough ways smooth.
\v 6 And all humanity will see the salvation of God.
\v 7 Therefore he said to the crowds coming out to be baptized by him, "You offspring of vipers, who warned you to flee from the coming wrath?"
\v 8 Therefore, produce fruits that are worthy of repentance, and do not begin to say to yourselves, ‘We have Abraham as our father.’ For I tell you that God is able to raise up children to Abraham from these stones.
\v 9 Already the axe is laid to the root of the trees; therefore, every tree that does not produce good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.
\v 10 And the crowds were asking him, "What then should we do?"
\v 11 He answered them, saying, 'Whoever has two coats must share with the one who has none, and whoever has food must do likewise.'
\v 12 Tax collectors also came to be baptized, and they asked him, 'Teacher, what should we do?'
\v 13 But he said to them, 'Collect no more than you are authorized to collect.'
\v 14 And the soldiers also asked him, 'And what shall we do?' He said to them, 'Do not intimidate anyone or accuse falsely, and be content with your wages.'
\v 15 As the people were in expectation and all were reasoning in their hearts about John, whether he might be the Christ,
\v 16 John answered them all, saying, 'I indeed baptize you with water; but there comes one who is mightier than I, whose sandals I am not worthy to untie. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and with fire.'
\v 17 He has his winnowing fork in his hand, and He will thoroughly clean out His threshing floor; He will gather the wheat into His barn, but the chaff He will burn with unquenchable fire.
\v 18 So with many other words of encouragement, he announced the good news to the people.
\v 19 But Herod the tetrarch, being rebuked by him concerning Herodias, his brother’s wife, and for all the evil things that Herod had done,
\v 20 Herod added this to all his other evils: he imprisoned John.
\v 21 Now it happened that when all the people were baptized, and Jesus also had been baptized and was praying, the heavens were opened.
\v 22 And the Holy Spirit descended upon him in bodily form like a dove, and a voice came from heaven saying, 'You are my beloved Son; in you I am well pleased.'
\v 23 Now Jesus, when he began his ministry, was about thirty years old, being considered the son of Joseph, the son of Heli.
\v 24 the son of Matthan, the son of Levi, the son of Melchi, the son of John, the son of Joseph,
\v 25 the son of Mattathias, the son of Amos, the son of Nahum, the son of Esli, the son of Naggai,
\v 26 the son of Maath, the son of Mattathias, the son of Semein, the son of Joseph, the son of Jodah,
\v 27 the son of John, the son of Rhesa, the son of Zerubbabel, the son of Shealtiel, the son of Neri,
\v 28 the son of Melchi, the son of Addi, the son of Cosam, the son of Elmadan, the son of Ir,
\v 29 the son of Joseph, the son of Eleazar, the son of Jorim, the son of Mattath, the son of Levi.
\v 30 the son of Simeon, the son of Judah, the son of Joseph, the son of Jonah, the son of Eliakim.
\v 31 the son of Melea, the son of Mainan, the son of Mattatha, the son of Nathan, the son of David,
\v 32 the son of Jesse, the son of Obed, the son of Boaz, the son of Salmon, the son of Nahshon,
\v 33 the son of Amminadab, the son of Ram, the son of Hezron, the son of Perez, the son of Judah,
\v 34 the son of Jacob, the son of Isaac, the son of Abraham, the son of Terah, the son of Nahor.
\v 35 the son of Serug, the son of Reu, the son of Peleg, the son of Eber, the son of Salah.
\v 36 the son of Cainan, the son of Arphaxad, the son of Shem, the son of Noah, the son of Lamech,
\v 37 the son of Methuselah, the son of Enoch, the son of Jared, the son of Mahalalel, the son of Cainan,
\v 38 the son of Enos, the son of Seth, the son of Adam, the son of God.
\c 4
\p
\v 1 Then Jesus, filled with the Holy Spirit, returned from the Jordan and was led by the Spirit into the wilderness.
\v 2 He was tempted by the devil for forty days. He ate nothing during those days, and when they were ended, he was hungry.
\v 3 And the devil said to Him, "If You are the Son of God, command this stone to become bread."
\v 4 And Jesus answered him, saying, "It is written, ‘Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that comes forth from the mouth of God.’"
\v 5 Then the devil took Him up to a high mountain and showed Him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time.
\v 6 And the devil said to Him, "I will give you all this authority and the glory of these kingdoms, for it has been handed over to me, and I can give it to whomever I wish."
\v 7 Therefore, if you will bow down and worship before me, it will all be yours.
\v 8 And Jesus answered him, "Get behind me, Satan; for it is written, 'You shall worship the Lord your God, and Him alone shall you serve.'"
\v 9 And he brought him to Jerusalem, set him on the pinnacle of the temple, and said to him, 'If you are the Son of God, throw yourself down from here;'
\v 10 For it is written, ‘He shall command His angels concerning you, to guard you,’
\v 11 and, 'They will lift you up in their hands, so that you will not strike your foot against a stone.'
\v 12 And Jesus answered him, saying, "It is said, 'You shall not put the Lord your God to the test.'"
\v 13 And when the devil had completed every temptation, he departed from Him until an opportune time.
\v 14 And Jesus returned to Galilee in the power of the Spirit, and news about Him spread throughout all the surrounding region.
\v 15 And He was teaching in their synagogues, being praised by everyone.
\v 16 And He came to Nazareth, where He had been raised, and as was His custom, He entered the synagogue on the Sabbath day, and He stood up to read.
\v 17 And the scroll of the prophet Isaiah was handed to Him, and He unrolled the scroll and found the place where it was written:
\v 18 The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because He has anointed me to proclaim good news to the poor. He has sent me to heal the brokenhearted,
\v 19 to proclaim the year of the Lord's favor.
\v 20 And when he had rolled up the scroll and returned it to the attendant, he sat down; and the eyes of all in the synagogue were fixed on him.
\v 21 And he began to say to them, "Today this scripture is fulfilled in your hearing."
\v 22 And all spoke well of Him and marveled at the words of grace that came from His mouth; and they said, 'Isn't this Joseph's son?'
\v 23 He said to them, 'Surely you will quote this proverb to me: 'Physician, heal yourself!' Whatever we heard was done in Capernaum, do here in your hometown as well.'
\v 24 But he said, 'Truly I tell you, no prophet is accepted in his own hometown.'
\v 25 But truly, I say to you, there were many widows in Israel in the days of Elijah, when the sky was shut up for three years and six months, and a great famine came over all the land.
\v 26 And Elijah was sent to none of them but only to a widow in Zarephath of Sidon.
\v 27 And there were many lepers in Israel during the time of Elisha the prophet, yet none of them were cleansed except Naaman the Syrian.
\v 28 And all in the synagogue were filled with rage when they heard these things.
\v 29 And rising up, they drove him out of the city and brought him to the edge of the hill on which their city was built, intending to throw him down the cliff.
\v 30 But he passed through the midst of them and went on his way.
\v 31 And he came down to Capernaum, a city of Galilee, and was teaching them on the Sabbaths.
\v 32 And they were amazed at His teaching, for His word possessed authority.
\v 33 And in the synagogue, there was a man possessed by an unclean spirit, and he cried out with a loud voice.
\v 34 ‘Leave us alone! What do you want with us, Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are—the Holy One of God!’
\v 35 But Jesus rebuked him, saying, 'Be silent and come out of him!' Then the demon threw the man down in the midst of the crowd and came out of him without harming him.
\v 36 And amazement came upon all, and they spoke to one another, saying, 'What is this word? For with authority and power He commands the unclean spirits, and they come out!'
\v 37 And the report about Him went out into every place of the surrounding region.
\v 38 After leaving the synagogue, He entered Simon's house. Now Simon's mother-in-law was suffering from a severe fever, and they asked Him about her.
\v 39 And standing over her, He rebuked the fever, and it left her. Immediately, she rose up and began to serve them.
\v 40 As the sun was setting, all who had any sick with various diseases brought them to Him. And He laid His hands on each one of them and healed them.
\v 41 And demons came out of many, crying out and saying, "You are the Christ, the Son of God." But He rebuked them and did not allow them to speak, because they knew that He was the Christ.
\v 42 And when day broke, He went out and departed to a lonely place. And the crowds sought Him, and came to Him and tried to keep Him from leaving them.
\v 43 But He said to them, 'I must proclaim the good news of the kingdom of God to the other towns as well; for that is why I was sent.'
\v 44 And He was proclaiming the message in the synagogues of Galilee.
\c 5
\p
\v 1 And it came to pass, as the crowd pressed around Him to hear the word of God, that He stood by the Lake of Gennesaret.
\v 2 And He saw two boats standing by the lake, but the fishermen had gone out of them and were washing their nets.
\v 3 Getting into one of the boats, which belonged to Simon, He asked him to put out a little from the land. And sitting down, He taught the people from the boat.
\v 4 When He had finished speaking, He said to Simon, "Put out into the deep water and let down your nets for a catch."
\v 5 And Simon answered Him, "Master, we toiled all night and caught nothing; but at Your word, I will let down the net."
\v 6 And when they had done this, they enclosed a great multitude of fish; and their net was breaking.
\v 7 And they signaled to their partners in the other boat to come and help them. And they came and filled both boats so that they began to sink.
\v 8 When Simon Peter saw this, he fell at Jesus' knees and said, 'Go away from me, Lord, for I am a sinful man.'
\v 9 For astonishment had seized him and all those with him, because of the catch of fish they had taken.
\v 10 And likewise, James and John, the sons of Zebedee, who were partners with Simon. And Jesus said to Simon, 'Do not be afraid; from now on you will be catching people.'
\v 11 And when they had brought their boats to land, they left everything and followed him.
\v 12 While he was in one of the cities, there came a man full of leprosy; and when he saw Jesus, he fell on his face and begged him, saying, "Lord, if you are willing, you can make me clean."
\v 13 And extending His hand, He touched him, saying, 'I am willing; be clean.' And immediately the leprosy left him.
\v 14 And He commanded him to tell no one, but go and show yourself to the priest, and offer for your cleansing the things which Moses commanded, as a testimony to them.
\v 15 Yet the news about Him continued to spread all the more, and large crowds gathered to hear Him and to be healed of their infirmities.
\v 16 But Jesus often withdrew to the wilderness and prayed.
\v 17 And it came to pass on one of those days, as He was teaching, that there were Pharisees and teachers of the law sitting nearby, who had come from every village of Galilee and Judea and from Jerusalem. And the power of the Lord was present to heal them.
\v 18 And behold, men were bringing on a bed a man who was paralyzed, and they sought to bring him in and lay him before Him.
\v 19 But when they could not find a way to bring him in because of the crowd, they went up on the roof and let him down with his bed through the tiles into the midst before Jesus.
\v 20 And when Jesus saw their faith, he said to the man, "Friend, your sins are forgiven."
\v 21 And the scribes and Pharisees began to reason, saying, "Who is this who speaks blasphemies? Who can forgive sins but God alone?"
\v 22 But Jesus, perceiving their thoughts, answered them, saying, "Why do you entertain thoughts in your hearts?
\v 23 Which is easier to say: 'Your sins are forgiven,' or to say, 'Get up and walk'?
\v 24 But so that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins—He said to the paralytic, 'I say to you, arise, and take up your bed and go to your house.'
\v 25 And at once he rose up before them, took up the mat on which he had been lying, and went home praising God.
\v 26 And all were astonished, and they glorified God, filled with fear, saying, 'We have seen extraordinary things today.'
\v 27 After this, He went out and saw a tax collector named Levi sitting at the tax booth, and He said to him, 'Follow Me.'
\v 28 And leaving everything behind, he rose up and followed Him.
\v 29 And Levi made a great feast for Him in his house, and there was a large crowd of tax collectors and others reclining at the table with them.
\v 30 And the scribes and Pharisees grumbled against His disciples, saying, "Why do you eat and drink with tax collectors and sinners?"
\v 31 And Jesus answered them, saying, "It is not the healthy who need a doctor, but those who are unwell."
\v 32 I have not come to call the righteous, but rather sinners to repentance.
\v 33 But they said to Him, 'Why do the disciples of John fast often and make prayers, and likewise those of the Pharisees, but Yours eat and drink?'
\v 34 But He said to them, "Can you make the friends of the bridegroom fast while the bridegroom is with them?"
\v 35 But the days will come when the bridegroom is taken away from them; then they will fast in those days.
\v 36 He also told them a parable: No one tears a piece from a new garment and puts it on an old one. If he does, he will tear the new garment, and the piece from the new will not match the old.
\v 37 And no one puts new wine into old wineskins; if he does, the new wine will burst the old skins, and the wine will be spilled, and the skins will be destroyed.
\v 38 But new wine must be put into new wineskins; otherwise, both will be ruined.
\v 39 And no one who drinks old wine immediately desires new; for he says, 'The old is better.'

\p
\v 1 Now it happened on the second Sabbath after the first that He was going through the grain fields, and His disciples plucked the heads of grain and ate, rubbing them in their hands.
\v 2 But some of the Pharisees said to them, "Why are you doing what is not lawful to do on the Sabbath?"
\v 3 And Jesus answered them, 'Have you not read what David did when he was hungry, he and those who were with him?'
\v 4 How he entered the house of God and took the sacred bread, eating it and giving some to those who were with him, which is not lawful for anyone to eat except for the priests alone?
\v 5 And He said to them, 'The Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath.'
\v 6 Now it happened on another Sabbath, that He entered the synagogue and taught; and there was a man there whose right hand was withered.
\v 7 And the scribes and the Pharisees were closely watching Him, whether He would heal on the Sabbath, so that they might find an accusation against Him.
\v 8 But He knew their thoughts and said to the man with the withered hand, "Rise and stand in the midst." And he rose and stood.
\v 9 So Jesus said to them, "I will ask you a question: Is it lawful on the Sabbath to do good or to do harm, to save a life or to destroy it?"
\v 10 And after looking around at them all, He said to the man, "Extend your hand." And he did so, and his hand was restored to its original state.
\v 11 But they were filled with madness, and they began to discuss with one another what they might do to Jesus.
\v 12 In those days, he went out to the mountain to pray, and he spent the whole night in prayer to God.
\v 13 And when the day came, He called His disciples to Himself and chose twelve of them, whom He also named apostles.
\v 14 Simon, whom He also named Peter, and his brother Andrew; James and John; Philip and Bartholomew.
\v 15 Matthew and Thomas, James the son of Alphaeus, and Simon called the Zealot.
\v 16 Judas, the son of James, and Judas Iscariot, who became a traitor.
\v 17 And after descending with them, He stood on a level place, and a multitude of His disciples, and a great crowd from all Judea and Jerusalem and the coastal region of Tyre and Sidon came to hear Him and to be healed of their diseases.
\v 18 And those who were troubled by unclean spirits came to Him, and they were healed.
\v 19 And all the crowd sought to touch him, for power was coming out from him and healing all.
\v 20 And he lifted up his eyes to his disciples and said: "Blessed are you who are poor, for yours is the kingdom of God."
\v 21 Blessed are you who are now hungry, for you shall be filled. Blessed are you who weep now, for you shall laugh.
\v 22 Blessed are you when people hate you, and when they exclude you and insult you, and reject your name as evil because of the Son of Man.
\v 23 Rejoice in that day and leap for joy, for behold, your reward is great in heaven; for in the same way their ancestors treated the prophets.
\v 24 But woe to you who are rich, for you have received your consolation.
\v 25 Woe to you who are full now, for you shall be hungry. Woe to you who laugh now, for you shall mourn and weep.
\v 26 Woe to you when all people speak well of you, for so their ancestors treated the false prophets.
\v 27 But to you who are listening, I say: Love your enemies, and do good to those who hate you.
\v 28 Bless those who speak ill of you; pray for those who mistreat you.
\v 29 To the one who strikes you on the cheek, offer the other also; and from the one who takes away your cloak, do not withhold your tunic.
\v 30 Give to everyone who asks of you, and from the one who takes away your possessions, do not demand them back.
\v 31 And as you wish that others would do to you, do so to them likewise.
\v 32 And if you love those who love you, what credit is that to you? For even sinners love those who love them.
\v 33 And if you do good to those who do good to you, what merit is there for you? For even sinners do the same.
\v 34 And if you lend to those from whom you hope to receive back, what credit is that to you? For even sinners lend to sinners, expecting to be repaid in full.
\v 35 But love your enemies, and do good, and lend expecting nothing in return; and your reward will be great, and you will be sons of the Most High, for he is kind to the ungrateful and the wicked.
\v 36 Be merciful, just as your Father is merciful.
\v 37 Do not judge, and you will not be judged; do not condemn, and you will not be condemned; forgive, and you will be forgiven.
\v 38 Give, and it will be given to you; a good measure, pressed down, shaken together, and overflowing, will be poured into your lap. For with the measure you use, it will be measured back to you.
\v 39 He also told them a parable: "Can a blind man guide a blind man? Will they not both fall into a pit?"
\v 40 A disciple is not above his teacher; but everyone who is fully trained will be like his teacher.
\v 41 Why do you see the speck that is in your brother's eye, but do not perceive the beam that is in your own eye?
\v 42 Or how can you say to your brother, ‘Brother, let me remove the speck that is in your eye,’ when you do not see the beam that is in your own eye? Hypocrite! First, remove the beam from your own eye, and then you will see clearly to remove the speck that is in your brother’s eye.
\v 43 For a good tree does not produce rotten fruit, nor does a rotten tree produce good fruit.
\v 44 For each tree is recognized by its own fruit. People do not gather figs from thornbushes, nor do they pick grapes from brambles.
\v 45 A good person brings good things out of the good stored up in their heart, and an evil person brings evil things out of the evil stored up in their heart. For the mouth speaks what the heart is full of.
\v 46 Why do you call me ‘Lord, Lord,’ and do not do what I say?
\v 47 Everyone who comes to me and hears my words and acts on them, I will show you what he is like:
\v 48 He is like a man building a house, who dug down deep and laid the foundation on rock. When a flood came, the torrent struck that house but could not shake it, because it was well built on the rock.
\v 49 But the one who hears and does not act is like a man who built a house on the ground without a foundation; when the river struck, it collapsed at once, and the ruin of that house was great.
\c 7
\p
\v 1 After He had finished all His words in the hearing of the people, He entered Capernaum.
\v 2 A centurion had a servant who was highly regarded and was sick to the point of death.
\v 3 Upon hearing about Jesus, the centurion sent some Jewish elders to Him, requesting that He come and heal his servant.
\v 4 And they came to Jesus, earnestly pleading with Him, saying, 'He is deserving for you to do this for him.'
\v 5 For he loves our nation and has built us a synagogue.
\v 6 And Jesus went with them. When he was not far from the house, the centurion sent friends to say to him, 'Lord, do not trouble yourself, for I am not worthy to have you come under my roof.'
\v 7 Therefore, I did not consider myself worthy to come to you; but just say the word, and my servant will be healed.
\v 8 For I, too, am a man set under authority, with soldiers under my command. I say to one, ‘Go,’ and he goes; to another, ‘Come,’ and he comes; and to my servant, ‘Do this,’ and he does it.
\v 9 When Jesus heard these things, he was amazed at him, and turning to the crowd that followed him, he said, 'I tell you, I have not found such great faith even in Israel.'
\v 10 When the messengers returned to the house, they found the servant well.
\v 11 And it happened soon afterward that He went to a city called Nain; and His disciples were with Him, a great multitude following.
\v 12 As He approached the city gate, a dead man was being carried out, the only son of his mother, and she was a widow. A considerable crowd from the city was with her.
\v 13 When the Lord saw her, He felt deep compassion for her and said to her, "Do not weep."
\v 14 And approaching the bier, He touched it, and the bearers stood still. He said, "Young man, I say to you, arise!"
\v 15 And the dead man sat up and began to speak, and Jesus gave him back to his mother.
\v 16 Fear seized all of them, and they glorified God, saying, "A great prophet has arisen among us," and "God has visited His people."
\v 17 And this report about Him went out through all of Judea and the surrounding region.
\v 18 And the disciples of John informed him about all these things.
\v 19 And John, calling two of his disciples to him, sent them to the Lord, asking, 'Are you the Coming One, or should we look for another?'
\v 20 When the men had come to Him, they said, 'John the Baptist has sent us to you, saying, “Are you the One who is to come, or should we expect someone else?”'
\v 21 In that very hour, He healed many from diseases, afflictions, and evil spirits; and He granted sight to many who were blind.
\v 22 And Jesus answered them, "Go and tell John what you have seen and heard: the blind receive their sight, the lame walk, lepers are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead are raised up, and the poor have the good news preached to them."
\v 23 And blessed is he who does not take offense at me.
\v 24 When the messengers of John had left, Jesus began to speak to the crowds about John: "What did you go out into the wilderness to see? A reed swaying in the wind?
\v 25 But what did you go out to see? A man dressed in fine clothing? Behold, those who wear splendid attire and live in luxury are found in palaces.
\v 26 But what did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes, I say to you, and even more than a prophet.
\v 27 This is the one about whom it is written, 'Behold, I send my messenger before your face, who will prepare your way before you.'
\v 28 For I say to you, among those born of women, no prophet is greater than John the Baptist; yet the least in the kingdom of God is greater than he.
\v 29 And all the people, including the tax collectors, acknowledged God's justice by being baptized with the baptism of John.
\v 30 But the Pharisees and the experts in the law rejected God's purpose for themselves, not having been baptized by him.
\v 31 To what then shall I liken the people of this generation, and to what are they like?
\v 32 They are like children sitting in the marketplace, calling to one another and saying, 'We played the flute for you, and you did not dance; we sang a dirge, and you did not weep.'
\v 33 For John the Baptist has come, eating no bread and drinking no wine, and you say, 'He has a demon.'
\v 34 The Son of Man has come eating and drinking, and you say, 'Look, a glutton and a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and sinners.'
\v 35 Yet wisdom is justified by all her children.
\v 36 One of the Pharisees asked Him to eat with him. And when He went into the Pharisee's house, He reclined at the table.
\v 37 And behold, a woman in the city, who was known to be a sinner, upon learning that He was reclining at the table in the Pharisee's house, brought an alabaster flask of fragrant oil.
\v 38 And standing behind Him at His feet, weeping, she began to wet His feet with her tears and wiped them with the hair of her head; and she kissed His feet and anointed them with the fragrant oil.
\v 39 Now when the Pharisee who had invited Him saw this, he spoke to himself, saying, "If this Man were a prophet, He would know who and what kind of woman is touching Him, for she is a sinner."
\v 40 And Jesus answered him, saying, "Simon, I have something to tell you." And he replied, "Teacher, say it."
\v 41 There were two debtors to a certain moneylender; one owed five hundred denarii, and the other fifty.
\v 42 But when they had nothing to repay, he freely forgave both. Now, tell me, which of them will love him more?
\v 43 Simon answered and said, 'I suppose the one to whom he forgave the greater debt.' And Jesus said to him, 'You have judged rightly.'
\v 44 Turning to the woman, He said to Simon, 'Do you see this woman? I entered your house, and you did not give Me any water for My feet, but she has wet My feet with her tears and wiped them with her hair.'
\v 45 You did not give Me a kiss, but this woman has not stopped kissing My feet since the moment I came in.
\v 46 You did not anoint My head with oil, but this woman has anointed My feet with perfume.
\v 47 Therefore, I say to you, her many sins are forgiven, for she has shown great love. But he who is forgiven little loves little.
\v 48 And He said to her, "Your sins are forgiven."
\v 49 And those who reclined at the table began to say among themselves, "Who is this that even forgives sins?"
\v 50 Then He said to the woman, 'Your faith has saved you; go in peace.'
\c 8
\p
\v 1 Soon afterward, He went through cities and villages, proclaiming and announcing the good news of the kingdom of God; and the twelve were with Him.
\v 2 And certain women who had been healed of evil spirits and diseases were with Him, among whom was Mary called Magdalene, from whom seven demons had gone out.
\v 3 and Joanna, the wife of Chuza, Herod's steward, and Susanna, and many others who were ministering to Him from their substance.
\v 4 And when a great multitude had gathered, and people were coming to Him from every city, He spoke to them by a parable.
\v 5 A sower went out to sow his seed. As he sowed, some fell along the path; it was trampled down, and the birds of the air devoured it.
\v 6 And other seed fell on the rocky ground; as it grew, it withered away because it had no moisture.
\v 7 And another seed fell among the thorns, and as the thorns grew up with it, they choked it out.
\v 8 And another seed fell on the good soil; and growing, it produced a hundredfold. As He said these things, He cried out, "Whoever has ears to hear, let him hear!"
\v 9 And His disciples asked Him, saying, "What does this parable mean?"
\v 10 He said, "To you it has been granted to know the mysteries of the kingdom of God, but to the others it is given in parables, so that seeing they may not see, and hearing they may not understand."
\v 11 Now this is the parable: The seed is the word of God.
\v 12 But those along the path are the ones who hear; then the devil comes and takes away the word from their hearts, so that they may not believe and be saved.
\v 13 But those on the rock are those who, when they hear the word, receive it with joy; yet they have no root, who believe for a while but in the time of testing fall away.
\v 14 And what fell among thorns, these are the ones who hear, but as they go on their way, they are choked by the cares, riches, and pleasures of life, and their fruit does not mature.
\v 15 But the ones that fell on the good soil, these are the ones who, having heard the word with a noble and good heart, hold it fast and bear fruit with patience.
\v 16 No one, after lighting a lamp, covers it with a container or puts it under a bed; instead, he puts it on a lampstand so that those who enter may see the light.
\v 17 For nothing is concealed that will not be made evident, nor is anything hidden that will not come to light.
\v 18 Take care then how you listen; for to the one who has, more will be given, but from the one who does not have, even what he thinks he has will be taken away.
\v 19 Then his mother and his brothers came to him, but they were unable to reach him because of the crowd.
\v 20 And it was reported to him, saying, "Your mother and your brothers are standing outside, desiring to see you."
\v 21 But he answered them, "My mother and my brothers are those who hear the word of God and put it into practice."
\v 22 One day, Jesus said to his disciples, "Let us cross over to the other side of the lake." So they got into the boat and set out.
\v 23 But while they were sailing, He fell asleep. And a fierce windstorm swept down on the lake, and they were being swamped and were in great danger.
\v 24 And they came to Him and awoke Him, saying, "Master, Master, we are perishing!" And He arose and rebuked the wind and the raging water, and they ceased, and there was a calm.
\v 25 He said to them, "Where is your faith?" They were afraid and amazed, and they said to one another, "Who then is this, that he commands even the winds and the water, and they obey him?"
\v 26 And they sailed to the region of the Gadarenes, which is across from Galilee.
\v 27 And as He stepped onto the land, a man from the city met Him who was possessed by demons for a long time. He wore no clothes and did not live in a house, but among the tombs.
\v 28 When he saw Jesus, he cried out and fell down before Him, shouting with a loud voice, "What do I have to do with You, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? I beg You, do not torment me!"
\v 29 For He commanded the unclean spirit to come out of the man. For it had seized him many times; he was kept under guard with chains and shackles, but he would break the bonds and be driven by the demon into deserted places.
\v 30 Jesus asked him, "What is your name?" He replied, "Legion," because many demons had entered into him.
\v 31 And they begged Him not to command them to depart into the Abyss.
\v 32 Now there was a large herd of pigs feeding on the hillside. And they begged Him to let them go into them; and He gave them permission.
\v 33 Then the demons came out from the man and entered the pigs; and the herd rushed down the steep bank into the lake and was drowned.
\v 34 When the herdsmen saw what had happened, they fled and reported it in the city and in the countryside.
\v 35 So they went out to see what had happened, and they came to Jesus and found the man from whom the demons had gone out, sitting at Jesus' feet, clothed and in his right mind; and they were afraid.
\v 36 And those who had seen it reported to them how the man who had been possessed by demons was saved.
\v 37 And all the people of the surrounding region of the Gadarenes asked Him to depart from them, for they were seized with great fear. So He got into the boat and returned.
\v 38 The man from whom the demons had gone out begged to stay with Him, but Jesus sent him away, saying,
\v 39 Return to your home, and declare all that God has done for you.' So he went away, proclaiming throughout the whole city what Jesus had done for him.
\v 40 Now when Jesus returned, the crowd welcomed him, for they were all eagerly waiting for him.
\v 41 And behold, a man named Jairus came, who was the ruler of the synagogue; and falling at Jesus' feet, he begged Him to come to his house.
\v 42 for he had an only daughter, about twelve years old, and she was dying. As he went, the crowds were pressing in on him.
\v 43 And there was a woman who had been suffering from a flow of blood for twelve years, and though she had spent all her livelihood on doctors, she could not be healed by any.
\v 44 She approached from behind and touched the fringe of his garment, and immediately her bleeding stopped.
\v 45 And Jesus said, "Who touched me?" When they all denied it, Peter and those with him said, "Master, the crowds surround you and press in on you, and yet you ask, 'Who touched me?'"
\v 46 But Jesus said, 'Someone touched me; I know that power has gone out from me.'
\v 47 When the woman saw that she could not remain hidden, she came trembling and fell down before Him. In the presence of all the people, she declared why she had touched Him and how she had been immediately healed.
\v 48 And He said to her, "Courage, daughter; your faith has brought you salvation. Go in peace."
\v 49 While He was still speaking, someone from the ruler's house came and said, 'Your daughter is dead; do not trouble the Teacher any longer.'
\v 50 But Jesus, hearing this, answered him, saying, 'Do not be afraid; only believe, and she will be made well.'
\v 51 And when He entered the house, He permitted no one to go in except Peter, John, and James, along with the father and mother of the girl.
\v 52 And all were weeping and mourning for her. But He said, 'Do not weep; she is not dead, but sleeping.'
\v 53 And they mocked Him, knowing that she was dead.
\v 54 But He took her by the hand and called, saying, "Child, arise!"
\v 55 And her spirit returned, and she immediately arose. And He commanded that she be given something to eat.
\v 56 And her parents were astonished. But He instructed them to tell no one what had happened.
\c 9
\p
\v 1 Then He gathered His twelve disciples and gave them power and authority over all demons and to cure diseases.
\v 2 And He sent them out to proclaim the kingdom of God and to heal the sick.
\v 3 And He said to them, "Take nothing for your journey: neither a staff, nor a bag, nor bread, nor money; and do not have two tunics."
\v 4 And into whichever house you enter, there remain, and from there go out.
\v 5 And as for those who do not welcome you, when you leave that city, shake the dust off your feet as a testimony against them.
\v 6 And going forth, they journeyed from village to village, proclaiming the good news and healing everywhere.
\v 7 Now Herod the tetrarch heard all that was happening, and he was perplexed, because it was said by some that John had risen from the dead.
\v 8 And by some it was said that Elijah had appeared; and by others, that one of the ancient prophets had risen.
\v 9 And Herod said, 'I beheaded John; but who is this of whom I hear such things?' And he sought to see Him.
\v 10 And when the apostles returned, they reported to Him all that they had done. Then He took them away privately to a solitary place near the city called Bethsaida.
\v 11 But when the crowds learned about it, they followed Him. He welcomed them and spoke to them about the kingdom of God, and He healed those in need of healing.
\v 12 As the day began to wane, the Twelve came to Him and said, 'Send the crowd away, so they can go to the surrounding villages and farms to find lodging and provisions, for we are in a desolate place here.'
\v 13 But He said to them, 'You give them something to eat.' They replied, 'We have no more than five loaves and two fish, unless we go and buy food for all these people.'
\v 14 For there were about five thousand men. He said to His disciples, 'Have them sit down in groups of fifty.'
\v 15 So they did as He instructed and reclined all together.
\v 16 Taking the five loaves and the two fish, He looked up to heaven and blessed them. Then He broke them and gave them to the disciples to set before the crowd.
\v 17 And all ate and were filled, and twelve baskets of broken pieces were taken up that remained.
\v 18 And it happened that while He was alone praying, His disciples joined Him, and He asked them, saying, 'Who do the crowds say that I am?'
\v 19 They answered, saying, 'John the Baptist; others say Elijah; and still others say that one of the ancient prophets has risen.'
\v 20 And he said to them, 'But what about you? Who do you say that I am?' Peter answered, 'The Christ of God.'
\v 21 But he strictly warned them not to tell this to anyone.
\v 22 saying, 'The Son of Man must suffer many things and be rejected by the elders, chief priests, and scribes, and be killed, and on the third day be raised up.'
\v 23 And He said to all, "If anyone desires to come after Me, let him deny himself, take up his cross daily, and follow Me."
\v 24 For whoever desires to save his life will lose it; but whoever loses his life for My sake, this one will save it.
\v 25 For what does it profit a person if he gains the whole world, but loses himself or suffers the loss of his very being?
\v 26 For whoever is ashamed of me and my words, the Son of Man will be ashamed of him when he comes in his glory, and the glory of the Father and of the holy angels.
\v 27 But I tell you truly, there are some standing here who will certainly not taste death until they see the kingdom of God.
\v 28 Now it came to pass, about eight days after these words, that He took Peter, John, and James, and went up on the mountain to pray.
\v 29 As He prayed, the appearance of His face was altered, and His clothing became dazzling white.
\v 30 And behold, two men were conversing with Him, who were Moses and Elijah.
\v 31 They appeared in glorious splendor and spoke of His departure, which He was about to accomplish in Jerusalem.
\v 32 But Peter and those who were with him were heavy with sleep; and when they were fully awake, they saw His glory and the two men who stood with Him.
\v 33 As they were leaving Him, Peter said to Jesus, "Master, it is good for us to be here; let us make three tents—one for You, one for Moses, and one for Elijah." He did not realize what he was saying.
\v 34 As He was saying these things, a cloud came and overshadowed them; and they were fearful as they entered the cloud.
\v 35 And a voice came from the cloud, saying, "This is my Son, my Chosen One; listen to Him."
\v 36 And when the voice had spoken, Jesus was found alone. And they kept silent and told no one in those days any of the things they had seen.
\v 37 And it came to pass that on the next day, as they were coming down from the mountain, a great crowd met him.
\v 38 And behold, a man from the crowd cried out, "Teacher, I beg you, look upon my son, for he is my only child."
\v 39 And behold, a spirit seizes him, and suddenly he cries out and convulses him, so that he is hardly able to leave him, crushing him.
\v 40 And I implored Your disciples to cast it out, but they were unable.
\v 41 And responding, Jesus said, 'O faithless and corrupt generation, how long shall I be with you and bear with you? Bring your son here to me.'
\v 42 While he was still approaching, the demon threw the boy down and convulsed him. But Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit, healed the child, and gave him back to his father.
\v 43 And all were filled with wonder at the greatness of God. While everyone marveled at all that Jesus did, He said to His disciples,
\v 44 Let these words sink into your ears: the Son of Man is about to be delivered into the hands of men.
\v 45 But they did not grasp what He was saying; it was hidden from them so that they would not perceive it, and they were afraid to ask Him about this saying.
\v 46 Then an argument arose among them as to which of them was the greatest.
\v 47 But Jesus, knowing the reasoning of their hearts, took a child and had him stand beside Him.
\v 48 And He said to them, "Whoever receives this child in My name receives Me; and whoever receives Me receives the One who sent Me. For he who is least among you all, he is the greatest."
\v 49 John replied, "Master, we saw someone casting out demons in Your name, and we stopped him because he does not follow with us."
\v 50 But Jesus said to him, "Do not hinder him; for he who is not against you is for you."
\v 51 As the days drew near for him to be taken up, he resolutely set his face to go to Jerusalem.
\v 52 And He sent messengers ahead of Him. They went into a Samaritan village to make preparations for Him.
\v 53 But they did not welcome Him, because His face was set toward Jerusalem.
\v 54 When His disciples James and John saw this, they said, 'Lord, do You want us to command fire to come down from heaven and consume them, as Elijah did?'
\v 55 But turning to them, He rebuked them, saying, 'You do not know what manner of spirit you are of;'
\v 56 For the Son of Man did not come to destroy the lives of men, but to save them. And they went to another village.
\v 57 As they were walking along the road, someone said to Him, 'Lord, I will follow You wherever You go.'
\v 58 But Jesus said to him, 'Foxes have dens and birds of the air have nests, but the Son of Man has nowhere to rest His head.'
\v 59 But He said to another, 'Follow Me.' And he said, 'Lord, let me first go and bury my father.'
\v 60 But Jesus said to him, "Let the spiritually dead bury their own dead. You, however, go and proclaim the kingdom of God."
\v 61 And another said, 'Lord, I will follow you; but first, let me go say goodbye to those at my home.'
\v 62 Jesus replied, "No one who puts their hand to the plow and looks back is fit for the kingdom of God."
\c 10
\p
\v 1 After this, the Lord appointed seventy others and sent them out two by two ahead of Him to every town and place where He Himself was about to go.
\v 2 He said to them, "The harvest is plentiful, but the workers are few. Therefore, beseech the Lord of the harvest to send out workers into His harvest."
\v 3 Go your way; behold, I send you out as lambs among wolves.
\v 4 Carry no money bag, no traveler's pouch, and do not greet anyone along the way.
\v 5 Into whatever house you enter, first say, ‘Peace be to this house!’
\v 6 And if a peaceful man is there, your peace will rest upon him; but if not, it will return to you.
\v 7 In that house, remain eating and drinking what they provide, for the laborer is worthy of his wages. Do not move from house to house.
\v 8 And into whatever city you enter, if they receive you, eat what is set before you.
\v 9 And heal the sick in that city, and say to them, ‘The kingdom of God has drawn near to you.’
\v 10 But into whichever town you enter, and they do not welcome you, go out into its streets and say:
\v 11 And regarding the dust that clings to us from your city, we shake it off against you. Nevertheless, know this: the kingdom of God has drawn near to you.
\v 12 But I tell you, it will be more bearable for Sodom on that day than for that city.
\v 13 Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! For if the miracles performed among you had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they would have long ago sat in sackcloth and ashes, repenting.
\v 14 But it will be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon in the judgment than for you.
\v 15 And you, Capernaum, exalted to the heights, will be brought down to the depths of Hades.
\v 16 Whoever listens to you listens to me, and whoever disregards you disregards me; and the one who disregards me disregards the one who sent me.
\v 17 The seventy returned with joy, saying, 'Lord, even the demons submit to us in your name!'
\v 18 He replied, 'I saw Satan fall like lightning from heaven.'
\v 19 Behold, I give you the authority to tread upon serpents and scorpions, and over all the power of the enemy, and nothing shall harm you.
\v 20 Nevertheless, do not rejoice in this, that the spirits are subject to you; but rather rejoice because your names are written in heaven.
\v 21 In that same hour, Jesus rejoiced in the Spirit and said, 'I praise you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that you have hidden these things from the wise and understanding and revealed them to infants; yes, Father, for such was your gracious will.'
\v 22 Turning to his disciples, he said, 'All things have been handed over to me by my Father; and no one knows who the Son is except the Father, and who the Father is except the Son, and anyone to whom the Son chooses to reveal him.'
\v 23 And turning to his disciples privately, he said, 'Blessed are the eyes that see what you see.'
\v 24 For I tell you that many prophets and kings desired to see what you see, and did not see it, and to hear what you hear, and did not hear it.
\v 25 And behold, a certain lawyer stood up, testing him, and saying, "Teacher, what must I do to inherit eternal life?"
\v 26 But He said to him, 'What is written in the Law? How do you read it?'
\v 27 He answered, 'You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, with all your strength, and with all your mind; and your neighbor as yourself.'
\v 28 He said to him, 'You have answered correctly; do this, and you will live.'
\v 29 But he, wishing to justify himself, asked Jesus, 'And who is my neighbor?'
\v 30 In response, Jesus said, 'A certain man was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho, and he fell among robbers, who stripped him of his clothes, beat him, and departed, leaving him half dead.'
\v 31 But by chance a certain priest was going down that road, and when he saw him, he passed by on the other side.
\v 32 Likewise, a Levite, when he came to the place and saw him, passed by on the other side.
\v 33 But a Samaritan, as he traveled, came where the man was; and when he saw him, he was filled with compassion.
\v 34 And he approached him, bandaging his wounds, pouring on oil and wine. Then he placed him on his own animal and brought him to an inn, caring for him.
\v 35 And the next day, he took out two denarii and gave them to the innkeeper, saying, 'Take care of him, and whatever more you may need to spend, I will repay you when I come back.'
\v 36 Which of these three do you think was a neighbor to the man who fell among the robbers?
\v 37 And he replied, 'The one who acted with compassion toward him.' Jesus then said to him, 'Go, and do likewise.'
\v 38 As they continued on their journey, Jesus entered a certain village, and a woman named Martha welcomed him into her home.
\v 39 And she had a sister named Mary, who sat at the feet of Jesus and listened to his teaching.
\v 40 But Martha was busy with much serving. And she went up to Him and said, 'Lord, do you not care that my sister has left me to serve alone? Tell her then to help me.'
\v 41 But Jesus answered her, "Martha, Martha, you are worried and troubled about many things;"}}}  عدم . Thus the phrase captures Jesus’ gentle rebuke while acknowledging Martha’s genuine concerns. It reflects a deep understanding of human anxiety and the call to prioritize spiritual nourishment over worldly distractions.

\v 1 Now it happened, while He was praying in a certain place, that when He stopped, one of His disciples said to Him, 'Lord, teach us to pray, just as John also taught his disciples.'
\v 2 He said to them, 'When you pray, say: Our Father in heaven, hallowed be Your name; let Your kingdom come; let Your will be done, on earth as it is in heaven.'
\v 3 Give us each day our bread for tomorrow.
\v 4 And forgive us our sins, for we also forgive everyone indebted to us; and lead us not into temptation, but rescue us from the evil one.
\v 5 And he said to them, "Which of you has a friend who will go to him at midnight and say to him, 'Friend, lend me three loaves of bread?'
\v 6 For a friend of mine has come to me from a journey, and I have nothing to set before him.
\v 7 And he from within will answer, ‘Do not trouble me; the door is already shut, and my children are with me in bed; I cannot rise and give you anything.’
\v 8 I tell you, even if he will not get up and give him anything because he is his friend, yet because of his boldness, he will rise and give him as much as he needs.
\v 9 So I say to you: Ask, and it will be given to you; seek, and you will find; knock, and it will be opened to you.
\v 10 For everyone who asks receives, and he who seeks finds, and to him who knocks it will be opened.
\v 11 Which of you fathers, if your son asks for a loaf of bread, will give him a stone? Or if he asks for a fish, will give him a serpent instead?
\v 12 Or if he asks for an egg, will he give him a scorpion?
\v 13 If you then, being evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will the heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to those who ask Him?
\v 14 And He was casting out a demon that was mute. When the demon left, the mute spoke, and the crowds were amazed.
\v 15 But some of them said, 'He casts out demons by Beelzebul, the ruler of the demons.'
\v 16 Others, to test him, demanded a sign from heaven.
\v 17 But he, knowing their thoughts, said to them, "Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation, and a house divided against a house falls."
\v 18 But if Satan is divided against himself, how will his kingdom endure? For you say that I cast out demons by Beelzebul.
\v 19 But if I cast out demons by Beelzebul, by whom do your sons cast them out? Therefore, they will be your judges.
\v 20 But if I cast out demons by the finger of God, then the kingdom of God has come upon you.
\v 21 When a strong man, fully armed, guards his own palace, his possessions are safe.
\v 22 But when a stronger man comes upon him and overcomes him, he takes away the armor in which he trusted and distributes his spoils.
\v 23 Whoever is not with me is against me; and whoever does not gather with me scatters.
\v 24 When the unclean spirit goes out from a person, it roams through dry places seeking rest, and finding none, it says, ‘I will return to the house from which I came.’
\v 25 And upon returning, it finds the house swept clean and beautifully arranged.
\v 26 Then it goes and takes seven other spirits more wicked than itself, and they enter in and dwell there; and the last state of that person is worse than the first.
\v 27 As he was saying these things, a woman in the crowd raised her voice and said to him, 'Blessed is the womb that bore you and the breasts at which you nursed!'
\v 28 But He said, 'Indeed, blessed are those who hear the word of God and keep it!'
\v 29 As the crowds gathered around Him, He began to say, 'This generation is a wicked generation. It seeks a sign, and no sign will be given to it except the sign of Jonah the prophet.'
\v 30 For just as Jonah became a sign to the people of Nineveh, so will the Son of Man be a sign to this generation.
\v 31 The Queen of the South will rise in judgment with the men of this generation and condemn them, for she came from the farthest parts of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and behold, something greater than Solomon is here.
\v 32 The men of Nineveh will rise up at the judgment with this generation and condemn it, for they repented at the preaching of Jonah, and behold, something greater than Jonah is here.
\v 33 No one lights a lamp and puts it in a hidden place or under a basket, but on a lampstand, so that those who come in may see its light.
\v 34 The eye is the lamp of your body. When your eye is clear, your whole body is also full of light; but when it is bad, your body is also full of darkness.
\v 35 Therefore, be careful that the light within you is not darkness.
\v 36 If then your body is all full of light, having no part dark, it will be entirely illuminated, as when the lamp gives you light with its brightness.
\v 37 While he was speaking, a Pharisee asked him to dine with him. So he went in and reclined at the table.
\v 38 But the Pharisee, when he saw it, was astonished that he had not first washed before the meal.
\v 39 But the Lord said to him, 'Now you Pharisees cleanse the outside of the cup and the dish, but inside you are filled with greed and wickedness.'
\v 40 You fools! Did not the One who made the outside also make the inside?
\v 41 But rather, give what is within as charity, and behold, everything will be clean for you.
\v 42 But woe to you, Pharisees! For you meticulously tithe mint, rue, and every kind of herb, yet you neglect justice and the love of God. These you ought to have practiced, without ignoring the others.
\v 43 Woe to you, Pharisees! For you love the seats of honor in the synagogues and the greetings in the marketplaces.
\v 44 Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you are like unmarked graves, and the people walking over them are unaware.
\v 45 One of the lawyers answered him, "Teacher, in saying these things, you insult us as well."
\v 46 But He said, "Woe to you also, lawyers! For you load men with burdens hard to bear, but you yourselves do not touch the burdens with one of your fingers."
\v 47 Woe to you! For you build the tombs of the prophets, and your fathers killed them.
\v 48 Therefore, you testify and approve of the works of your fathers; for they killed the prophets, and you are building their tombs.
\v 49 For this reason, the wisdom of God declared, ‘I will send them prophets and apostles, and some of them they will kill and persecute.’
\v 50 so that the blood of all the prophets, which has been shed since the foundation of the world, may be sought after from this generation.
\v 51 from the blood of Abel to the blood of Zechariah, who was slain between the altar and the sanctuary; yes, I tell you, it will be required of this generation.
\v 52 Woe to you experts in the law! For you have taken away the key to knowledge. You yourselves did not enter, and you hindered those who were trying to enter.
\v 53 As He spoke these things, the scribes and the Pharisees began to provoke Him vehemently and to press Him hard about many matters.
\v 54 They were lurking around Him, seeking to catch something from His mouth, in order that they might accuse Him.

\v 1 As the crowds gathered in thousands, pressing upon one another, Jesus began to speak first to His disciples, saying, "Beware of the leaven of the Pharisees, which is hypocrisy."
\v 2 For there is nothing concealed that will not be revealed, nor hidden that will not be known.
\v 3 Therefore, whatever you have said in the darkness will be heard in the light, and what you have whispered in private rooms will be proclaimed from the rooftops.
\v 4 I say to you, My friends, do not fear those who can kill the body, and after that have no more they can do.
\v 5 But I will show you whom you should fear: fear him who, after he has killed, has authority to throw you into hell. Yes, I tell you, fear him!
\v 6 Are not five sparrows sold for two pennies? And not one of them is forgotten before God.
\v 7 But even the very hairs of your head are all counted. Therefore, do not fear; you are of more value than many sparrows.
\v 8 I tell you this: everyone who acknowledges Me before others, the Son of Man will also acknowledge them before the angels of God.
\v 9 But the one who denies Me in front of people will be denied in front of the angels of God.
\v 10 And everyone who speaks a word against the Son of Man will be forgiven; but whoever speaks blasphemy against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven.
\v 11 When they bring you before the synagogues, the rulers, and the authorities, do not worry about how or what you should defend yourselves or what you should say.
\v 12 For the Holy Spirit will teach you in that very hour what you ought to say.
\v 13 Then someone from the crowd said to Him, "Teacher, tell my brother to divide the inheritance with me."
\v 14 But He said to him, "Man, who appointed me to be a judge or divider over you?"
\v 15 And He said to them, "Take heed and beware of all greed, for one's life does not consist in the abundance of the things he possesses."
\v 16 And He told them a parable, saying: "The land of a certain rich man produced abundantly."
\v 17 And he pondered within himself, saying, ‘What shall I do, for I have no place to store my harvest?’
\v 18 And he said, ‘This is what I will do: I will tear down my barns and build larger ones, and there I will store all my grain and my goods.'
\v 19 And I will say to my soul, ‘Soul, you have ample goods laid up for many years; relax, eat, drink, and be merry.’
\v 20 But God said to him, 'Fool, this very night your soul will be demanded of you. And the things you have prepared, whose will they be?'
\v 21 So it is with the one who treasures up riches for himself and is not rich toward God.
\v 22 Then He said to His disciples, "For this reason I tell you, do not be anxious about your life, what you will eat; nor about your body, what you will wear."
\v 23 For life is more than food, and the body is more than clothing.
\v 24 Consider the ravens: they do not sow or reap; they have no storeroom or barn, yet God feeds them. How much more valuable are you than birds!
\v 25 And which of you by worrying can add a single hour to his life?
\v 26 If then you are not able to do even the smallest thing, why are you anxious about the rest?
\v 27 Consider the lilies, how they grow: they do not labor nor spin; yet I tell you, not even Solomon in all his splendor was clothed like one of these.
\v 28 But if God clothes the grass of the field, which is here today and tomorrow is thrown into the oven, how much more will He clothe you, O you of little faith?
\v 29 And you, do not seek what you will eat or what you will drink, and do not let your minds be filled with anxiety.
\v 30 For all the nations of the world seek after these things, and your Father knows that you need them.
\v 31 But seek the kingdom of God, and all these things will be given to you as well.
\v 32 Do not be afraid, little flock, for your Father has been pleased to give you the kingdom.
\v 33 Sell your possessions and give to the needy. Provide yourselves with money bags that do not grow old, a treasure in the heavens that does not fail, where no thief approaches and no moth destroys.
\v 34 For where your treasure is, there your heart will also be.
\v 35 Let your waists be girded and your lamps burning; 
\v 36 And you yourselves be like men who are waiting for their master, when he returns from the wedding, that when he comes and knocks, they may immediately open to him.
\v 37 Blessed are those servants whom the master finds alert when he comes. Truly, I say to you, he will gird himself to serve, and have them sit down to eat, and will come and serve them.
\v 38 And if he should come in the second watch, or in the third watch, and finds them so, blessed are those servants.
\v 39 But this know, that if the master of the house had been aware of what hour the thief was coming, he would have stayed awake and not allowed his house to be broken into.
\v 40 Therefore, you also must be ready; for the Son of Man is coming at an hour you do not expect.
\v 41 Peter said, "Lord, are you telling this parable to us, or to everyone?"
\v 42 And the Lord said, "Who then is the faithful and wise manager, whom the master will set over his household to give them their portion of food at the proper time?"
\v 43 Blessed is that servant whom his master will find doing so when he comes.
\v 44 Truly, I say to you, he will appoint him over all his possessions.
\v 45 But if that servant says in his heart, ‘My master is taking a long time to return,’ and begins to beat the male and female servants, and to eat and drink and get drunk,
\v 46 The master of that servant will come on a day he does not expect and at an hour he is not aware of; he will cut him in two and assign him a place with the unfaithful.
\v 47 That servant who knew his master's will but did not prepare himself or act according to his will will be beaten with many stripes.
\v 48 But the one who did not know, yet committed deeds worthy of stripes, will be beaten with few. For everyone to whom much was given, much will be required of him, and to whom much has been entrusted, they will ask for more.
\v 49 I have come to set the earth on fire, and how I wish it were already kindled!
\v 50 But I have a baptism to be baptized with, and how I am pressed until it is accomplished!
\v 51 Do you think that I have come to bring peace to the earth? No, I tell you, but rather division.
\v 52 For from now on, there will be five in one house divided: three against two and two against three.
\v 53 They will be divided: father against son, and son against father; mother against daughter, and daughter against mother; mother-in-law against daughter-in-law, and daughter-in-law against mother-in-law.
\v 54 He also said to the crowds, "When you see a cloud rising in the west, immediately you say, ‘A rainstorm is coming,’ and it does."}}} ρους  as  the input text, the output must also  include a distinct interpretation and an explanation of the metaphorical significance of discerning signs.
\v 55 And when the south wind blows, you say, ‘It will be scorching heat,’ and it happens.
\v 56 Hypocrites! You know how to discern the appearance of the sky and the earth, but why do you not know how to discern this present time?
\v 57 And why do you not even of your own accord judge what is right?
\v 58 As you go with your adversary to the magistrate, make every effort along the way to settle with him, lest he drag you to the judge, and the judge deliver you to the officer, and the officer throw you into prison.
\v 59 I tell you, you will not leave there until you have paid the very last cent.

\v 1 At that time, some present reported to Him about the Galileans whose blood Pilate had mixed with their sacrifices.
\v 2 And Jesus answered them, "Do you think that these Galileans were worse sinners than all the other Galileans because they suffered such things?
\v 3 No, I tell you; but unless you repent, you will all likewise perish.
\v 4 Or those eighteen who were killed when the tower in Siloam fell on them; do you think they were worse offenders than all the others living in Jerusalem?
\v 5 No, I tell you; but unless you repent, you will all likewise perish.
\v 6 He spoke this parable: A certain man had a fig tree planted in his vineyard, and he came seeking fruit on it and found none.
\v 7 So he said to the vineyard keeper, 'Look, for three years I have come seeking fruit on this fig tree and find none. Cut it down; why should it use up the ground?'
\v 8 But he answered him, 'Sir, let it alone this year also, until I dig around it and put manure on it.'
\v 9 And if it bears fruit next year, well and good; but if not, you can cut it down.'
\v 10 Now he was teaching in one of the synagogues on the Sabbath.
\v 11 And behold, there was a woman who had a spirit of infirmity for eighteen years, and she was bent over and could not fully lift herself up.
\v 12 When Jesus saw her, He called out to her and said, 'Woman, you are freed from your infirmity.'
\v 13 And He laid His hands on her; and instantly she was made straight, and she glorified God.
\v 14 But the ruler of the synagogue, indignant because Jesus had healed on the Sabbath, said to the crowd, 'There are six days in which work ought to be done. Come on those days and be healed, and not on the Sabbath day.'
\v 15 The Lord answered him, "Hypocrite! Does not each of you on the Sabbath untie his ox or his donkey from the stall and lead it away to water it?
\v 16 And ought not this woman, a daughter of Abraham whom Satan has bound for eighteen years, be loosed from this bond on the Sabbath day?
\v 17 As He said these things, all His adversaries were put to shame, and all the multitude rejoiced at all the glorious things done by Him.
\v 18 He said therefore, "To what can the kingdom of God be compared? What shall I use to describe it?
\v 19 It is like a mustard seed that a man took and planted in his own garden; it grew and became a great tree, and the birds of the air nested in its branches.
\v 20 Again he asked, "To what shall I compare the Kingdom of God?
\v 21 It is like yeast that a woman took and hid in three measures of flour until the whole batch was leavened.
\v 22 And He was journeying through cities and villages, teaching and making His way to Jerusalem.
\v 23 And someone asked Him, "Lord, are there few who are saved?" And He said to them,
\v 24 Strive to enter through the narrow door, for I tell you, many will seek to enter and will not be able to.
\v 25 When the owner of the house rises up and shuts the door, you will begin to stand outside and knock at the door, saying, ‘Lord, Lord, open for us.’ But he will answer and say to you, ‘I do not know where you are from.’
\v 26 Then you will begin to say, ‘We ate and drank in your presence, and you taught in our streets.’
\v 27 And he will say, ‘I tell you, I do not know where you come from; depart from me, all you workers of injustice.’
\v 28 There, in that place, will be weeping and gnashing of teeth, when you see Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and all the prophets in the kingdom of God, but you yourselves are cast out.
\v 29 And they will come from the east and the west, from the north and the south, and will recline at the table in the kingdom of God.
\v 30 Indeed, there are those who are last who will be first, and there are those who are first who will be last.
\v 31 At that very hour, some Pharisees approached him and said, "Get away from here and go somewhere else, for Herod wants to kill you."
\v 32 And He said to them, 'Go tell that fox, “Behold, I cast out demons and perform healings today and tomorrow, and on the third day I complete my work.”'
\v 33 Nevertheless, I must journey today, tomorrow, and the day following, for it cannot be that a prophet would perish outside of Jerusalem.
\v 34 O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, the city that kills the prophets and stones those sent to her! How often I longed to gather your children together, as a hen gathers her chicks under her wings, but you were unwilling!
\v 35 Behold, your house is left desolate. I tell you, you will not see Me again until you say, ‘Blessed is He who comes in the name of the Lord.’

\v 1 One Sabbath, when Jesus went to eat at the house of a prominent Pharisee, they were watching Him closely.
\v 2 And behold, there was a certain man before Him who was suffering from dropsy.
\v 3 And Jesus answered the lawyers and Pharisees, saying, "Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath?"
\v 4 But they remained silent. And taking hold of him, He healed him and let him go.
\v 5 And He responded to them, saying, "Which of you, having a son or an ox that falls into a pit, will not immediately pull him out on the Sabbath day?"
\v 6 And they could not respond to Him concerning these matters.
\v 7 He told a parable to those who were invited, observing how they chose the best seats, saying to them:
\v 8 When you are invited by someone to a wedding feast, do not recline at the place of honor, lest someone more distinguished than you be invited by him.
\v 9 And when the one who invited you and him comes, he will say to you, ‘Give this man a seat.’ Then you will begin with shame to take the lowest place.
\v 10 But when you are invited, go and sit in the lowest place, so that when the one who invited you comes, he may say to you, ‘Friend, move up higher.’ Then you will be honored in the presence of all who sit at the table with you.
\v 11 For everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, and he who humbles himself will be exalted.
\v 12 And He said to the one who had invited Him, "When you host a banquet or a dinner, do not invite your friends, your brothers, your relatives, or your wealthy neighbors; lest they also invite you in return, and you be repaid.
\v 13 But when you host a banquet, invite the poor, the crippled, the lame, and the blind.
\v 14 And you will be blessed, for they cannot repay you; for you will be repaid at the resurrection of the righteous.
\v 15 When one of those reclining at the table heard these things, he said to Him, "Blessed is the one who will eat bread in the kingdom of God!"
\v 16 But He said to him, 'A certain man prepared a great feast and invited many guests.'
\v 17 And he sent his servant at the time of the banquet to tell those who were invited, 'Come, for everything is ready now.'
\v 18 But they all began to make excuses. The first said to him, 'I have bought a field, and I must go out to see it. I ask you to have me excused.'
\v 19 And another said, 'I have bought five yoke of oxen, and I am going to examine them. I ask you to excuse me.'
\v 20 And another said, 'I have married a wife, and therefore I cannot come.'
\v 21 And when that servant came back, he reported these things to his master. Then, in his anger, the master said to the servant, 'Go out quickly to the streets and lanes of the city, and bring in the poor, the crippled, the blind, and the lame here.'
\v 22 And the servant said, 'Lord, it is done as you commanded, and there is still room.'
\v 23 And the lord said to the servant, 'Go out to the roads and hedges, and compel them to come in, so that my house may be filled.'
\v 24 For I tell you that none of those men who were invited will taste my banquet.
\v 25 Now great multitudes went with Him. And turning to them, He said,
\v 26 If anyone comes to Me and does not prioritize Me above his father, mother, wife, children, brothers, sisters, and even his own life, he cannot be My disciple.
\v 27 And whoever does not bear his own cross and come after me cannot be my disciple.
\v 28 For which of you, intending to build a tower, does not first sit down and estimate the cost, to see whether he has enough to complete it?
\v 29 Otherwise, when he has laid the foundation and is unable to finish, all who see it will begin to ridicule him.
\v 30 saying, 'This man began to build and was not able to finish.'
\v 31 Or what king, going to engage another king in battle, will not first sit down and consider whether he is able with ten thousand to meet him who comes against him with twenty thousand?
\v 32 But if he is not able, while he is still far off, he sends a delegation and asks for terms of peace.
\v 33 So likewise, any one of you who does not renounce all that he possesses cannot be My disciple.
\v 34 Salt is a good thing; but if salt becomes tasteless, how will it be seasoned?
\v 35 It is neither fit for the land nor for the manure pile; it is thrown away. He who has ears to hear, let him hear!
\c 15
\p
\v 1 Now all the tax collectors and sinners were drawing near to Him to hear Him.
\v 2 And the Pharisees and scribes began to murmur, saying, 'This man welcomes sinners and eats with them.'
\v 3 So He told them this parable, saying:
\v 4 Which one of you, having a hundred sheep, if he loses one of them, does not leave the ninety-nine in the wilderness and go after the lost one until he finds it?
\v 5 And when he has found it, he joyfully places it on his shoulders.
\v 6 And upon arriving at his home, he gathers his friends and neighbors, saying to them, 'Rejoice with me, for I have found my lost sheep!'
\v 7 I tell you that in the same way, there will be joy in heaven over one sinner who repents than over ninety-nine righteous people who have no need of repentance.
\v 8 Or what woman, having ten silver coins, if she loses one coin, does not light a lamp, sweep the house, and diligently search until she finds it?
\v 9 And when she finds it, she calls together her friends and neighbors, saying, 'Rejoice with me, for I have found the silver coin that I had lost!'
\v 10 Just so, I tell you, there is joy before the angels of God over one sinner who repents.
\v 11 He then said, 'A certain man had two sons.'
\v 12 And the younger of them said to his father, 'Father, give me the share of the estate that belongs to me.' And he divided his wealth between them.
\v 13 And not many days later, the younger son gathered all he had and went on a journey to a distant country, where he squandered his inheritance in reckless living.
\v 14 After he had spent everything, a severe famine arose in that land, and he began to be in need.
\v 15 So he went and attached himself to one of the citizens of that country, who sent him into his fields to feed pigs.
\v 16 He longed to fill his belly with the pods that the pigs were eating, but no one gave him anything.
\v 17 But when he came to himself, he said, 'How many of my father’s hired servants have more than enough bread, but I perish here with hunger!'
\v 18 I will arise and go to my father, and I will say to him, ‘Father, I have sinned against heaven and before you.'
\v 19 I am no longer worthy to be called your son; treat me as one of your hired servants.
\v 20 And he arose and came to his father. But when he was still a great way off, his father saw him and had compassion, and ran and fell on his neck and kissed him.
\v 21 And the son said to him, ‘Father, I have sinned against heaven and before you, and I am no longer worthy to be called your son.’
\v 22 But the father said to his servants, ‘Bring out the best robe and clothe him, and put a ring on his hand and sandals on his feet.
\v 23 And bring the fattened calf here and kill it, and let us eat and celebrate.
\v 24 For this son of mine was dead and is alive again; he was lost and is found.' And they began to celebrate.
\v 25 Now his older son was in the field; and as he came near to the house, he heard music and dancing.
\v 26 And he summoned one of the servants and began to inquire what these things might mean.
\v 27 And he said to him, 'Your brother has arrived, and your father has killed the fattened calf, because he has received him back safe and sound.'
\v 28 But he became angry and refused to go in. Therefore, his father came out and entreated him.
\v 29 But he answered his father, ‘Look, these many years I have served you, and I never disobeyed your command, yet you never gave me even a young goat that I might celebrate with my friends.’
\v 30 But when this son of yours came, who has wasted your wealth with prostitutes, you killed the fattened calf for him.
\v 31 ‘Son, you are always with me, and everything I have is yours.
\v 32 But it was right to celebrate and be glad, for this brother of yours was dead and is alive again; he was lost and has been found.
\c 16
\p
\v 1 He also said to his disciples, "There was a certain rich man who had a steward, and this steward was accused to him of wasting his goods."
\v 2 So he called him and said to him, ‘What is this I hear about you? Give an account of your stewardship, for you can no longer be steward.’
\v 3 Then the steward said within himself, 'What shall I do? For my master is taking away the stewardship from me. I cannot dig; I am ashamed to beg.'
\v 4 I know what I will do, so that when I am removed from my stewardship, they may welcome me into their own homes.
\v 5 And calling to himself each of his master's debtors, he said to the first, 'How much do you owe my master?'
\v 6 He said, 'A hundred measures of oil.' And he said to him, 'Take your bill, and sit down quickly and write fifty.'
\v 7 Then he said to another, 'And what do you owe?' And he replied, 'A hundred measures of wheat.' He said to him, 'Take your bill, and write eighty.'
\v 8 And the master commended the unrighteous steward for his shrewdness; for the children of this world are more astute in dealing with their own generation than the children of light.
\v 9 And I tell you, make friends for yourselves by means of unrighteous wealth, so that when it fails, they may receive you into eternal dwellings.
\v 10 The one who is faithful in a very little is also faithful in much, and the one who is unjust in a very little is also unjust in much.
\v 11 So if you have not been faithful in unrighteous wealth, who will entrust to you the true riches?
\v 12 And if you have not been faithful in that which belongs to another, who will give you what is your own?
\v 13 No servant can serve two masters; for either he will hate the one and love the other, or he will hold to one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and wealth.
\v 14 The Pharisees, who were lovers of money, heard all these things and ridiculed Him.
\v 15 And He said to them, 'You justify yourselves before others, but God knows your hearts; for what is revered among men is detestable in the sight of God.'
\v 16 The Law and the Prophets were until John; since then, the Kingdom of God is being proclaimed, and everyone is forcefully pressing into it.
\v 17 But it is easier for heaven and earth to pass away than for one stroke of a letter of the Law to fall.
\v 18 Everyone who divorces his wife and marries another commits adultery, and he who marries a woman who is divorced from her husband commits adultery.
\v 19 There was a certain rich man who was clothed in purple and fine linen, living in splendid luxury every day.
\v 20 But there was a certain beggar named Lazarus, who was laid at his gate, covered with sores.
\v 21 And longing to be filled with the crumbs that fell from the rich man's table; moreover, even the dogs came and licked his sores.
\v 22 And it came to pass that the poor man died and was carried away by the angels to Abraham's side; the rich man also died and was buried.
\v 23 And in Hades, lifting up his eyes while in torment, he saw Abraham from afar, and Lazarus in his bosom.
\v 24 And he cried out, 'Father Abraham, have mercy on me, and send Lazarus so that he may dip the tip of his finger in water and cool my tongue, for I am in agony in this flame.'
\v 25 But Abraham said, 'Child, remember that you received your good things in your lifetime, and Lazarus in like manner bad things; but now he is comforted here, and you are in anguish.'
\v 26 And besides all this, a great chasm has been fixed between us and you, so that those who wish to pass from here to you cannot, nor can anyone cross over from there to us.
\v 27 And he said, 'Then I ask you, father, to send him to my father's house.'
\v 28 For I have five brothers; let him warn them, so that they will not also come to this place of torment.
\v 29 But Abraham said to him, 'They have Moses and the prophets; let them hear them.'
\v 30 But he said, 'No, father Abraham, but if someone goes to them from the dead, they will repent.'
\v 31 But he said to him, 'If they do not listen to Moses and the Prophets, neither will they be convinced if someone rises from the dead.'
\c 17
\p
\v 1 He said to His disciples, "It is impossible for offenses not to come, but woe to the one through whom they come!"
\v 2 It would be better for him if a large millstone were hung around his neck and he were thrown into the sea than for him to cause one of these little ones to stumble.
\v 3 Take heed to yourselves. If your brother sins against you, rebuke him; and if he repents, forgive him.
\v 4 And if he sins against you seven times in a day, and seven times returns to you, saying, 'I repent,' you must forgive him.
\v 5 The apostles said to the Lord, 'Increase our faith.'
\v 6 And the Lord said, "If you have faith like a mustard seed, you could say to this mulberry tree, 'Be uprooted and planted in the sea,' and it would obey you."
\v 7 But which of you, having a servant plowing or tending sheep, will say to him when he has come in from the field, 'Come at once and sit down to eat'?
\v 8 But will he not rather say to him, ‘Prepare my meal, and gird yourself and serve me until I have eaten and drunk, and afterward you will eat and drink’?
\v 9 Does he thank the servant because he did what was commanded? I think not.
\v 10 So you also, when you have done all that you were commanded, say, ‘We are unworthy servants; we have only done what was our duty.’
\v 11 As He was on His way to Jerusalem, He was passing through the region between Samaria and Galilee.
\v 12 As He entered a certain village, ten men who had leprosy met Him; they stood at a distance.
\v 13 And they raised their voices, saying, "Jesus, Master, have mercy on us!"
\v 14 When He saw them, He said to them, 'Go and show yourselves to the priests.' And as they went, they were cleansed.
\v 15 One of them, when he saw that he was healed, turned back with a loud voice, praising God.
\v 16 And he fell on his face at His feet, giving thanks to Him; and he was a Samaritan.
\v 17 And Jesus answered, "Were not ten cleansed? But where are the nine?"
\v 18 Was no one found to return and give glory to God except this foreigner?
\v 19 And He said to him, "Rise and go your way; your faith has made you well."
\v 20 When asked by the Pharisees when the kingdom of God would come, He answered them and said, "The kingdom of God does not come with signs to be observed."
\v 21 Nor will they say, 'Look, here it is!' or 'There it is!' For behold, the kingdom of God is within you.
\v 22 And He said to the disciples, 'The days are coming when you will long to see one of the days of the Son of Man, but you will not see it.'
\v 23 And they will say to you, 'Look, here!' or 'Look, there!' Do not go after them or follow them.
\v 24 For just as lightning flashes and shines from one part of the sky to the other, so will it be on the day of the Son of Man.
\v 25 But first, He must suffer greatly and be rejected by this generation.
\v 26 Just as it was in the days of Noah, so will it be in the days of the Son of Man.
\v 27 They were eating and drinking, marrying and being given in marriage, until the day that Noah entered the ark, and the flood came and destroyed them all.
\v 28 Likewise, just as it was in the days of Lot: they were eating, drinking, buying, selling, planting, and building.
\v 29 But on the day Lot left Sodom, fire and sulfur rained down from heaven and destroyed them all.
\v 30 It will be the same on the day when the Son of Man is revealed.
\v 31 On that day, let the one who is on the roof and his belongings in the house not go down to take them away, and likewise, let the one who is in the field not turn back.
\v 32 Remember Lot’s wife.
\v 33 Whoever seeks to preserve their life will lose it, but whoever loses their life will keep it.
\v 34 I tell you, in that night there will be two people on one bed; one will be taken and the other will be left.
\v 35 Two women will be grinding grain together; one will be taken and the other will be left.
\v 36 Two will be in the field; one will be taken and the other will be left behind.
\v 37 And they answered Him, 'Where, Lord?' He said to them, 'Wherever the body is, there the eagles will be gathered together.'
\c 18
\p
\v 1 And He told them a parable to show that they should always pray and not lose heart.
\v 2 He said: "In a certain city, there was a judge who did not fear God nor regard man."
\v 3 And there was a widow in that city; and she came to him, saying, 'Grant me justice against my adversary.'
\v 4 And for a time he refused; but afterward he said to himself, 'Though I do not fear God nor respect man,'.
\v 5 Yet because this widow keeps bothering me, I will grant her justice, so that she will not wear me out by her continual coming.
\v 6 And the Lord said, 'Listen to what the unjust judge says;'
\v 7 And will not God bring about justice for His chosen ones who cry out to Him day and night? Will He keep putting them off?
\v 8 I tell you that He will surely bring about justice for them swiftly. But when the Son of Man comes, will He find faith on the earth?
\v 9 He also told this parable to some who trusted in themselves that they were righteous and despised others:
\v 10 Two men went up to the temple to pray, one a Pharisee and the other a tax collector.
\v 11 The Pharisee stood by himself and prayed this: ‘God, I thank You that I am not like other men—robbers, evildoers, adulterers—or even like this tax collector here.
\v 12 I fast twice a week and give a tenth of all I acquire.
\v 13 But the tax collector, standing far off, would not even lift his eyes to heaven, but beat his breast, saying, 'God, have mercy on me, a sinner!'
\v 14 I tell you, this man went down to his house justified rather than the other; for everyone who lifts himself up will be brought low, but he who humbles himself will be lifted high.
\v 15 People were also bringing babies to Him so that He might touch them; but when the disciples saw it, they rebuked them.
\v 16 But Jesus called them to Him, saying, "Let the children come to Me, and do not hinder them; for to such belongs the kingdom of God."
\v 17 Truly, I tell you, whoever does not receive the kingdom of God like a child will never enter it.
\v 18 And a ruler asked him, saying, "Good Teacher, what must I do to inherit eternal life?"
\v 19 But Jesus said to him, "Why do you call me good? No one is good except for God alone."
\v 20 You know the commandments: Do not commit adultery, do not murder, do not steal, do not give false testimony, honor your father and your mother.
\v 21 He replied, 'I have kept all these commandments since my youth.'
\v 22 When Jesus heard this, He said to him, 'There is still one thing you lack: Sell all that you have and distribute to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven. Then come, follow me.'
\v 23 But when he heard these things, he became very sad, for he was extremely wealthy.
\v 24 But seeing him distressed, Jesus said, "How hard it is for those who possess wealth to enter the kingdom of God!"
\v 25 For it is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than for a wealthy person to enter the kingdom of God.
\v 26 Those who heard this said, 'Then who can possibly be saved?'
\v 27 But He said, "What is impossible for people is possible for God."
\v 28 And Peter said, 'Look, we have forsaken everything and followed you.'
\v 29 And He said to them, 'Truly, I say to you, there is no one who has left house or parents or brothers or wife or children for the sake of the Kingdom of God,
\v 30 who will not receive many times more in this present age, and in the age to come, eternal life.
\v 31 Then he took the twelve aside and said to them, 'Look, we are going up to Jerusalem, and all that is written by the prophets about the Son of Man will be accomplished.'
\v 32 For He will be handed over to the Gentiles, and they will mock Him, mistreat Him, and spit upon Him.
\v 33 and after scourging Him, they will kill Him, but on the third day He will rise again.
\v 34 But they did not understand any of these things. This saying was hidden from them, and they did not grasp what was said.
\v 35 As Jesus drew near to Jericho, a certain blind man was sitting by the roadside begging.
\v 36 And hearing the multitude passing by, he asked what this meant.
\v 37 They reported to him that Jesus of Nazareth was passing by.
\v 38 And he shouted, saying, 'Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me!'
\v 39 And those who led the way rebuked him, telling him to be quiet; but he cried out all the more, 'Son of David, have mercy on me!'
\v 40 So Jesus stood still and ordered him to be brought to Him. When the man approached, Jesus asked him, saying,
\v 41 Jesus asked him, "What do you want me to do for you?" The blind man replied, "Lord, that I may receive my sight."
\v 42 And Jesus said to him, "Receive your sight; your faith has healed you."
\v 43 And immediately he regained his sight and followed Him, glorifying God. And all the people, when they saw it, gave praise to God.
\c 19
\p
\v 1 And as He entered, He was passing through Jericho.
\v 2 And behold, there was a man named Zacchaeus; he was a chief tax collector, and he was wealthy.
\v 3 And he sought to see who Jesus was, but could not because of the crowd, for he was short in stature.
\v 4 So he ran on ahead and climbed up into a sycamore tree to see him, for he was about to pass that way.
\v 5 When Jesus reached the spot, He looked up and said to him, "Zacchaeus, hurry down! For I must stay at your house today."
\v 6 So he hurried down and joyfully welcomed Him.
\v 7 All the people saw this and began to mutter, "He has gone to be the guest of a man who is a sinner."
\v 8 But Zacchaeus stood up and said to the Lord, 'Look, Lord! Here and now I give half of my possessions to the poor, and if I have cheated anyone out of anything, I will pay back four times the amount.'
\v 9 Jesus said to him, 'Today salvation has come to this house, because this man too is a son of Abraham.'
\v 10 For the Son of Man came to seek and to save what was lost.
\v 11 While they were listening to these things, He added and spoke a parable, because He was near Jerusalem, and they supposed that the kingdom of God was going to appear immediately.
\v 12 Therefore He said, 'A certain nobleman went to a distant country to receive a kingdom for himself, and then return.'
\v 13 Calling ten of his servants, he gave them ten minas and said to them, 'Engage in trade until I come back.'
\v 14 But his citizens hated him and sent a delegation after him, saying, 'We do not want this man to reign over us.'
\v 15 And it happened that when he returned, having received the kingdom, he commanded that those servants be called to him to whom he had given the money, so that he might know what each had gained by trading.
\v 16 The first came forward, saying, ‘Master, your mina has earned ten minas more.’
\v 17 And he said to him, ‘Well done, good servant! Because you have been faithful in a very small matter, you shall have authority over ten cities.’
\v 18 And the second came, saying, ‘Lord, your mina has earned five minas more.’
\v 19 And to him he said, ‘And you shall be in charge of five cities.’
\v 20 And another came, saying, ‘Lord, behold, here is your mina, which I kept laid away in a handkerchief.'
\v 21 For I was afraid of you, because you are a severe man; you take up what you did not lay down, and reap what you did not sow.
\v 22 He said to him, 'By your own words I will judge you, you wicked servant. You knew that I am a harsh man, taking up what I did not lay down and reaping what I did not sow.
\v 23 And why did you not place my money on deposit, so that when I returned, I could have collected it with interest?
\v 24 And to those standing by, he said, 'Take the mina away from him and give it to the one who has ten minas.'
\v 25 And they said to him, 'Master, he has ten minas already.'
\v 26 I tell you that to everyone who has, more will be given; but from the one who does not have, even what he thinks he has will be taken away from him.
\v 27 But as for these enemies of mine, who did not want me to reign over them, bring them here and slay them in my presence.
\v 28 And after saying these things, He went on ahead, ascending toward Jerusalem.
\v 29 And it came to pass that as He approached Bethphage and Bethany, near the mount called Olives, He sent two of His disciples.
\v 30 Saying, 'Go to the village ahead of you; there, as you enter, you will find a colt tied, on which no one has ever sat. Untie it and bring it here.'
\v 31 And if anyone asks you, 'Why are you untying it?' you shall say to them, 'The Lord has need of it.'
\v 32 So those who were sent went away and found it just as He had told them, standing there.
\v 33 As they were untying the colt, its owners asked them, 'Why are you untying the colt?'
\v 34 They said, 'The Lord has need of it.'
\v 35 And they brought it to Jesus, and throwing their own garments on the colt, they set Jesus on it.
\v 36 As He went along, they spread their cloaks on the road.
\v 37 As He was drawing near, already at the descent of the Mount of Olives, the whole multitude of His disciples began to rejoice and praise God with a loud voice for all the mighty works that they had seen.
\v 38 They cried out, 'Blessed is the King who comes in the name of the Lord! Peace in heaven and glory in the highest!'
\v 39 And some of the Pharisees from the crowd said to Him, 'Teacher, rebuke Your disciples.'
\v 40 But He answered and said to them, 'I tell you that if these should keep silent, the stones would immediately cry out.'
\v 41 And as He drew near, seeing the city, He wept over it.
\v 42 saying, "If you had known, even you, especially in this your day, the things that make for your peace! But now they are hidden from your eyes.
\v 43 For days are coming upon you when your enemies will lay siege to you and encircle you, and they will press in on you from every side.
\v 44 and they will crush you and your children within you; they will not leave in you one stone upon another, because you did not recognize the time of your visitation.
\v 45 And he entered the temple and began to drive out those who were selling and buying there.
\v 46 saying to them, 'It is written, "My house shall be a house of prayer," but you have turned it into a den of robbers.'
\v 47 And he was teaching daily in the temple; but the chief priests and the scribes sought to destroy him, as did the leading men of the people.
\v 48 And they could not find a way to act, for all the people were hanging on his words.
\c 20
\p
\v 1 Now it happened that on one of those days, while He was teaching the people in the temple and proclaiming the good news, the chief priests and the scribes, along with the elders, approached Him.
\v 2 They spoke to Him, saying, "Tell us, by what authority are You doing these things? Or who is it that gave You this authority?"
\v 3 But He answered and said to them, "I will ask you one question as well; answer Me this, and I will tell you by what authority I do these things."
\v 4 Was the baptism of John from heaven, or was it from men?
\v 5 But they reasoned among themselves, saying, 'If we say, ‘From heaven,’ he will say, ‘Why then did you not believe him?’
\v 6 But if we say, ‘From men,’ the people will stone us, for they are convinced that John was a prophet.
\v 7 So they answered that they did not know where it was from.
\v 8 And Jesus said to them, "Nor will I tell you by what authority I do these things."
\v 9 He began to tell the people this parable: "A certain man planted a vineyard, and leased it to farmers, and went away for a long time."
\v 10 At the appropriate time, he sent a servant to the farmers to receive some of the vineyard's fruit; but the farmers beat him and sent him away empty-handed.
\v 11 And he added to send another servant; but they beat him also and treated him with contempt, and sent him away empty-handed.
\v 12 And he sent a third servant. But they also wounded him and cast him out.
\v 13 Then the owner of the vineyard said, 'What shall I do? I will send my beloved Son; perhaps when they see him, they will feel ashamed.'
\v 14 But when the tenants saw him, they reasoned among themselves, saying, 'This is the heir. Come, let us kill him, so that the inheritance may be ours.'
\v 15 And having thrown him out of the vineyard, they killed him. What then will the owner of the vineyard do to them?
\v 16 He will come and destroy those farmers, and will give the vineyard to others." Upon hearing this, they exclaimed, "God forbid!"
\v 17 But he looked directly at them and said, 'What then does this Scripture mean: “The stone that the builders rejected has become the cornerstone”?'
\v 18 Everyone who falls on that stone will be shattered; but upon whomsoever it falls, it will grind him to powder.
\v 19 The chief priests and the scribes sought to lay hands on Him at that very hour, but they feared the people, for they knew that He had spoken this parable against them.
\v 20 So they watched Him closely and sent out spies, pretending to be righteous, in order to catch Him in something He might say, so they could deliver Him to the authority and power of the governor.
\v 21 So they questioned Him, saying, 'Teacher, we know that you speak and teach rightly, and you do not show favoritism, but truly teach the way of God.'
\v 22 Is it lawful for us to give tribute to Caesar, or not?
\v 23 But perceiving their cunning, He said to them, 'Why do you test me?'
\v 24 Show me a denarius. Whose likeness and inscription does it bear? They replied, 'Caesar's.'
\v 25 He said to them, 'Then give to Caesar what belongs to Caesar, and to God what belongs to God.'
\v 26 And they could not seize upon His words in opposition to the people; and marveling at His reply, they fell silent.
\v 27 Then some of the Sadducees, who deny that there is a resurrection, came to Him and questioned Him.
\v 28 They asked Him, "Teacher, Moses wrote for us that if a man's brother dies, leaving a wife but no children, the man must take the wife and raise up children for his brother."
\v 29 Now there were seven brothers; and the first took a wife, and died without children.
\v 30 And the second brother took her as his wife, and he also died without leaving any children.
\v 31 And the third also took her, and in the same manner, all seven died, leaving no children.
\v 32 Finally, the woman also died.
\v 33 In the resurrection, therefore, whose wife does she become? For the seven had her as a wife.
\v 34 And Jesus answered them, "The sons of this age marry and are given in marriage;"
\v 35 But those who are deemed worthy to attain that age and the resurrection from the dead neither marry nor are given in marriage.
\v 36 For they can no longer die, because they are like angels and are children of God, being children of the resurrection.
\v 37 But concerning the resurrection of the dead, even Moses revealed this at the burning bush, when he calls the Lord the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.
\v 38 For God is not the God of the dead, but of the living; for all are alive to Him.
\v 39 And some of the scribes answered and said, Teacher, You have spoken well.
\v 40 And they no longer dared to ask Him anything.
\v 41 But He said to them, 'How is it that they say the Christ is the Son of David?'
\v 42 And David himself says in the book of Psalms, 'The Lord said to my Lord, “Sit at my right hand.”'
\v 43 until I make your enemies a footstool for your feet.
\v 44 David calls him 'Lord.' How then can he be his son?
\v 45 While all the people were listening, he said to his disciples,
\v 46 Beware of the scribes who desire to walk in long robes, and love greetings in the marketplaces, the best seats in the synagogues, and the places of honor at banquets.
\v 47 They devour the houses of widows and for the sake of appearance make long prayers; these will receive a greater judgment.
\c 21
\p
\v 1 As He looked up, Jesus saw the rich putting their gifts into the treasury.
\v 2 And He saw a poor widow putting in two small coins there.
\v 3 And He said, "Truly I tell you, this poor widow has put in more than all the others."
\v 4 For all these gave from their surplus to the offerings of God, but she, out of her poverty, gave all she had to live on.
\v 5 And as some were speaking of the temple, how it was adorned with beautiful stones and gifts dedicated to God, He said,
\v 6 As for what you see here, the days will come when there will not be left a stone upon another that will not be torn down.
\v 7 And they asked him, saying, "Teacher, when will these things be? And what will be the sign when these things are about to happen?"
\v 8 And He said, "Watch yourselves that you are not led astray; for many will come in My name, saying, 'I am He,' and, 'The time has come near.' Do not follow them."
\v 9 But when you hear of wars and upheavals, do not be frightened; for these things must happen first, but the end will not come immediately.
\v 10 Then He said to them, ‘Nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom.’
\v 11 And there will be great earthquakes in various places, and famines and pestilences; and there will be fearful sights and great signs from heaven.
\v 12 But before all these things, they will lay their hands on you and persecute you, delivering you up to synagogues and prisons, and bringing you before kings and governors because of my name.
\v 13 This will turn out to be your opportunity for testimony.
\v 14 So set in your hearts not to premeditate how to defend yourselves.
\v 15 For I will give you a mouth and wisdom, which none of your adversaries will be able to contradict or resist.
\v 16 But you will be betrayed even by parents and relatives, friends and brothers, and they will put some of you to death.
\v 17 And you will be hated by all because of my name.
\v 18 But not a hair on your head will perish.
\v 19 By your patience, you will secure your souls.
\v 20 But when you see Jerusalem surrounded by armies, then know that its desolation is near.
\v 21 Then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains, and let those who are in the city depart, and let not those who are in the countryside enter her.
\v 22 For these are the days of vengeance, when all that has been written must be fulfilled.
\v 23 But woe to those who are pregnant and to those who are nursing babies in those days! For there will be great distress upon the earth, and wrath upon this people.
\v 24 And they will fall by the edge of the sword, and will be led away captive into all nations, and Jerusalem will be trampled by the Gentiles until the times of the Gentiles are fulfilled.
\v 25 And there will be signs in the sun, and in the moon, and in the stars; and on the earth, nations will be in anguish, confused by the roaring of the sea and the waves.
\v 26 People will faint from fear and anticipation of what is coming upon the world, for the powers of heaven will be shaken.
\v 27 And then they will see the Son of Man coming in a cloud with great power and great glory.
\v 28 But when these things begin to take place, straighten up and lift up your heads, because your redemption is drawing near.
\v 29 And He told them a parable: "Look at the fig tree, and all the trees.
\v 30 When they are already putting forth leaves, you see for yourselves and know that summer is now near.
\v 31 So you also, when you see these things happening, know that the Kingdom of God is near.
\v 32 Truly, I say to you, this generation will not pass away until all things have taken place.
\v 33 Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will never pass away.
\v 34 But take heed to yourselves, lest your hearts be weighed down with the excesses of indulgence and the cares of life, and that day come upon you unexpectedly.
\v 35 For it will come as a snare upon all those who dwell on the face of the whole earth.
\v 36 Therefore, stay alert at all times, praying that you may be counted worthy to escape all these things that are about to happen, and to stand before the Son of Man.
\v 37 During the days, he was teaching in the temple; but at night he would go out and stay on the Mount called Olivet.
\v 38 And all the people rose early to come to him at the temple to hear him.
\c 22
\p
\v 1 Now the Feast of Unleavened Bread, which is called the Passover, was approaching.
\v 2 And the chief priests and the scribes were seeking how they might put him to death, for they feared the people.
\v 3 Then Satan entered into Judas, who was called Iscariot, one of the twelve.
\v 4 And having departed, he conferred with the chief priests and the scribes and the captains about how he might betray Him to them.
\v 5 And they rejoiced and agreed to give him silver.
\v 6 So he agreed and sought a suitable opportunity to betray Him to them without the crowd.
\v 7 Then came the day of unleavened bread, on which the Passover had to be sacrificed.
\v 8 So He sent Peter and John, saying, 'Go and make preparations for us to eat the Passover.'
\v 9 They asked Him, 'Where do You want us to prepare for You to eat the Passover?'
\v 10 He said to them, 'Behold, when you enter the city, a man carrying a jar of water will meet you. Follow him to the house he enters.
\v 11 And you shall say to the owner of the house, ‘The Teacher asks you, Where is the guest room where I may eat the Passover with my disciples?’
\v 12 And he will show you a large furnished upper room; there make ready.
\v 13 So they went and found everything just as He had told them, and they prepared the Passover.
\v 14 When the hour had come, He reclined at the table, and the twelve apostles were with Him.
\v 15 And He said to them, "With great desire I have longed to eat this Passover with you before I suffer."
\v 16 For I say to you, I will no longer eat of it until it is fulfilled in the kingdom of God.
\v 17 And taking the cup, he gave thanks and said, 'Take this and share it among yourselves;'
\v 18 For I tell you that I will not drink of the fruit of the vine until the kingdom of God comes.
\v 19 And he took bread, and after giving thanks, he broke it and gave it to them, saying, "This is my body, which is given for you; do this in remembrance of me."
\v 20 Likewise, after the meal, he took the cup, saying, "This cup is the new covenant established in my blood, which is being poured out for you."
\v 21 But behold, the hand of the one who betrays me is with me at the table.
\v 22 For the Son of Man is going away as it has been predetermined; but woe to that man by whom he is betrayed.
\v 23 And they began to question one another about who among them it could be that would do this.
\v 24 A dispute also arose among them about which of them would be regarded as the greatest.
\v 25 But Jesus said to them, "The kings of the nations exercise dominion over them, and those in authority are called benefactors."
\v 26 But you are not to be like that. Rather, let the greatest among you become as the youngest, and the leader as one who serves.
\v 27 For who is greater, the one who reclines at the table or the one who serves? Is it not the one who reclines? But I am among you as the one who serves.
\v 28 But you are those who have stood by Me in My trials.
\v 29 And I grant you a kingdom, just as my Father granted it to me.
\v 30 so that you may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom, and sit on thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel.
\v 31 And the Lord said, "Simon, Simon! Behold, Satan has asked for you, that he might sift you as wheat.
\v 32 But I have prayed for you, that your faith may not fail; and when you have returned, strengthen your brothers.
\v 33 But he said to Him, "Lord, I am ready to go with You, both to prison and to death."
\v 34 But He said, "I tell you, Peter, the rooster will not crow today before you deny three times that you know Me."
\v 35 And He said to them, 'When I sent you out without money bags, knapsacks, and sandals, did you lack anything?' They said, 'Nothing.'
\v 36 He said to them, 'But now, let the one who has a money bag take it, and likewise a knapsack; and let the one who has no sword sell his cloak and buy one.'
\v 37 For I tell you that this Scripture must be fulfilled in me: 'He was counted among the lawless'; for what is written about me is reaching its fulfillment.
\v 38 And they said, "Lord, look, here are two swords." And He replied, "It is enough."
\v 39 And going out, He proceeded as was His custom to the Mount of Olives; and His disciples also followed Him.
\v 40 And when He came to the place, He said to them, 'Pray that you may not enter into temptation.'
\v 41 And he withdrew from them about a stone's throw, and kneeling down, he prayed.
\v 42 saying, "Father, if You are willing, take this cup away from me; nevertheless, not my will, but Yours be done."
\v 43 Then an angel appeared to Him from heaven, strengthening Him.
\v 44 And being in agony, He prayed more earnestly; and His sweat became like great drops of blood falling down to the ground.
\v 45 And when He rose from prayer and went to His disciples, He found them asleep, weighed down by sorrow.
\v 46 And He said to them, 'Why are you sleeping? Arise and pray, so that you do not enter into temptation.'
\v 47 While He was still speaking, a crowd appeared, and Judas, one of the twelve, was leading them. He approached Jesus to kiss Him.
\v 48 But Jesus said to him, "Judas, are you betraying the Son of Man with a kiss?"
\v 49 When those around Him saw what was about to happen, they said, 'Lord, should we strike with a sword?'
\v 50 And one of them struck the servant of the high priest and cut off his right ear.
\v 51 But Jesus responded, 'Allow this much,' and touching his ear, He healed him.
\v 52 Then Jesus said to those who had come against Him—the chief priests, the captains of the temple, and the elders—'Have you come out with swords and clubs as if I were a bandit?'
\v 53 Every day I was with you in the temple, yet you did not reach out your hands against me. But this is your hour, the time when darkness holds sway.
\v 54 Then they seized him and led him away into the high priest's house. But Peter followed at a distance.
\v 55 And when they had lit a fire in the middle of the courtyard and were sitting together, Peter sat among them.
\v 56 But a certain servant girl, seeing him sitting in the light, looked closely at him and said, 'This man also was with him.'
\v 57 But he denied it, saying, 'Woman, I do not know him.'
\v 58 And after a little while, another saw him and said, 'You also are one of them.' But Peter said, 'Man, I am not.'
\v 59 About an hour later, another asserted confidently, 'Certainly this man was with him, for he is a Galilean.'
\v 60 But Peter said, 'Man, I do not know what you are talking about.' And immediately, while he was still speaking, a rooster crowed.
\v 61 And turning, the Lord looked at Peter. And Peter remembered the word of the Lord, how He had said to him, 'Before the rooster crows, you will deny Me three times.'
\v 62 And when he had gone outside, Peter wept bitterly.
\v 63 And the men who were holding Jesus mocked Him, striking Him.
\v 64 And having covered His face, they struck Him on the cheeks and questioned Him, saying, 'Prophesy, who is the one that struck You?'
\v 65 And they spoke many other blasphemous things against Him.
\v 66 When day broke, the council of the people assembled, along with the chief priests and the scribes, and they brought Him before their council, saying:
\v 67 If You are the Christ, tell us plainly. But He said to them, 'If I tell you, you will not believe me;'
\v 68 And if I were to ask you, you would neither answer me nor let me go.
\v 69 But from now on, the Son of Man will be seated at the right hand of the power of God.
\v 70 Then they all said, "Are You then the Son of God?" He said to them, "You rightly say that I am."
\v 71 And they said, 'What further need do we have for testimony? For we ourselves have heard it from his own mouth.'
\c 23
\p
\v 1 Then the entire multitude of them arose and led Him away to Pilate.
\v 2 And they began to accuse Him, saying, 'We found this man perverting our nation and forbidding to pay taxes to Caesar, saying that He Himself is Christ, a King.'
\v 3 Then Pilate asked Him, 'Are You the King of the Jews?' Jesus answered him, 'You say so.'
\v 4 Then Pilate said to the chief priests and the crowd, 'I find no charge against this man.'
\v 5 But they insisted, saying, 'He stirs up the people, teaching throughout all Judea, beginning from Galilee all the way here.'
\v 6 Upon hearing this, Pilate asked if the man was from Galilee.
\v 7 And realizing that He was under the authority of Herod, he sent Him back to Herod, for he was also in Jerusalem during those days.
\v 8 When Herod saw Jesus, he was greatly pleased; for he had long wanted to see Him because he had heard so many things about Him, and he hoped to see some miracle performed by Him.
\v 9 He questioned Him with probing words, but Jesus gave him no answer.
\v 10 And the scribes and the chief priests stood vehemently accusing Him.
\v 11 Then Herod, with his soldiers, treated Him with contempt and mocked Him. They dressed Him in a splendid robe and sent Him back to Pilate.
\v 12 That day, Herod and Pilate became friends; for before this, they had been enemies with each other.
\v 13 Pilate then summoned the chief priests, the rulers, and the people.
\v 14 He said to them, 'You brought this man to me as one who misleads the people, and behold, I have examined Him in your presence and have found no reason for the charges you bring against Him.'
\v 15 But neither did Herod, for I sent you to him, and behold, he has found nothing deserving of death in Him.
\v 16 Therefore, I will chastise him and release him.
\v 17 For he was obligated to release one prisoner to them at the feast.
\v 18 But they all cried out together, saying, 'Away with this man, and release to us Barabbas!'
\v 19 who had been thrown into prison for a certain insurrection that had taken place in the city, and for murder.
\v 20 Then Pilate spoke again, wishing to release Jesus.
\v 21 But they shouted, saying, "Crucify Him! Crucify Him!"
\v 22 But he said to them a third time, "Why? What wrong has this man done? I have found no reason for death in him; therefore I will chastise him and release him."
\v 23 But they persisted with loud voices, demanding that he be crucified. Their voices, along with those of the chief priests, prevailed.
\v 24 So Pilate decided that their request should be granted.
\v 25 So he released to them Barabbas, the one who had been imprisoned for insurrection and murder, whom they had asked for; but he handed Jesus over to their will.
\v 26 And as they led him away, they seized a certain Simon of Cyrene, who was coming in from the field, and they laid the cross upon him to carry it behind Jesus.
\v 27 And a large crowd of people followed Him, including women who were mourning and lamenting for Him.
\v 28 But Jesus turned to them and said, "Daughters of Jerusalem, do not weep for me; weep rather for yourselves and for your children."
\v 29 For behold, the days are coming when they will say, 'Blessed are the barren and the wombs that never bore, and the breasts that never nursed.'
\v 30 Then they will begin to say to the mountains, 'Fall upon us!' and to the hills, 'Cover us!'
\v 31 For if they do these things when the tree is green, what will happen when it is dry?
\v 32 They also led away two other criminals to be executed with Him.
\v 33 When they arrived at the place called the Skull, they crucified Him there, along with the criminals—one on His right and the other on His left.
\v 34 But Jesus said, "Father, forgive them, for they do not understand what they are doing." And they divided His garments and cast lots.
\v 35 And the people stood by watching, but the rulers scoffed at Him, saying, 'He saved others; let Him save Himself, if He is the Christ, the chosen one of God.'
\v 36 The soldiers also mocked Him, coming up and offering Him sour wine.
\v 37 and saying, "If You are the King of the Jews, save Yourself!"
\v 38 There was also an inscription written above Him in letters of Greek, Latin, and Hebrew: "This is the King of the Jews."
\v 39 One of the criminals hanging there railed at him, saying, 'Aren’t you the Messiah? Save yourself and us!'
\v 40 But the other answered and rebuked him, saying, 'Do you not fear God, since you are under the same condemnation?'
\v 41 And we indeed are suffering justly; for we are receiving what we deserve for our deeds; but this man has done nothing wrong.
\v 42 And he said to Jesus, 'Lord, remember me when You come into Your kingdom.'
\v 43 And Jesus said to him, 'Truly, I say to you, today you will be with Me in paradise.'
\v 44 It was now about the sixth hour, and darkness fell over the whole land until the ninth hour, as the sun was obscured.
\v 45 And the veil of the temple was torn in two, right down the middle.
\v 46 And Jesus cried out with a loud voice, 'Father, into Your hands I commit my spirit.' Having said this, He breathed His last.
\v 47 When the centurion saw what had happened, he glorified God, saying, 'Certainly, this man was righteous.'
\v 48 And all the crowds that had gathered to witness this spectacle, seeing what had happened, began to beat their breasts and returned home.
\v 49 But all His acquaintances stood at a distance, watching these things, and the women who had followed Him from Galilee were also there, observing.
\v 50 And behold, there was a man named Joseph, a member of the council, a good and righteous man.
\v 51 This man had not agreed with their plan and action. He was from the city of Arimathea in Judea, and he was himself waiting for the kingdom of God.
\v 52 This man went to Pilate and requested the body of Jesus.
\v 53 And taking it down, he wrapped it in a linen cloth and placed it in a hewn tomb, where no one had yet been laid.
\v 54 It was the day of Preparation, and the Sabbath was about to begin.
\v 55 And the women who had come with Him from Galilee followed, and they observed the tomb and how His body was laid.
\v 56 Then they returned and prepared spices and fragrant oils. And they rested on the Sabbath according to the commandment.
\c 24
\p
\v 1 But on the first day of the week, very early in the morning, they came to the tomb, bringing the spices they had prepared, and certain others with them.
\v 2 They found the stone rolled away from the entrance of the tomb.
\v 3 And when they entered, they did not find the body of the Lord Jesus.
\v 4 And while they were perplexed about this, suddenly two men stood beside them in gleaming attire.
\v 5 And as they were filled with fear and bowed their faces to the ground, the men said to them, "Why do you seek the living among the dead?"
\v 6 He is not here; He has risen! Remember how He told you while He was still in Galilee,
\v 7 saying, 'The Son of Man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men, and be crucified, and on the third day rise again.'
\v 8 And they remembered His words,
\v 9 And returning from the tomb, they reported all these things to the eleven and to all the others.
\v 10 It was Mary Magdalene, Joanna, Mary the mother of James, and the other women with them who told these things to the apostles.
\v 11 And their words appeared to them as idle tales, and they did not believe them.
\v 12 But Peter rose up and ran to the tomb. Stooping down, he saw the linen cloths lying alone; and he went away to his own home, marveling at what had happened.
\v 13 And behold, two of them were traveling that very day to a village called Emmaus, which was about sixty stadia from Jerusalem.
\v 14 And they were conversing with one another about all these events that had happened.
\v 15 And as they were talking and discussing, Jesus Himself drew near and walked with them.
\v 16 But their eyes were restrained, so they did not recognize Him.
\v 17 He said to them, "What are these words you are exchanging with each other as you walk, and why are you so troubled?"
\v 18 One of them, named Cleopas, answered him, "Are you the only visitor in Jerusalem who does not know the things that have happened there in these days?"
\v 19 And He said to them, "What things?" And they said to Him, "The things concerning Jesus of Nazareth, who was a mighty prophet in deed and word before God and all the people.
\v 20 How the chief priests and our rulers delivered Him to be sentenced to death and crucified Him.
\v 21 But we had hoped that He was the one to redeem Israel. Yet, with all these things, today is the third day since these events took place.
\v 22 But also, some of the women among us astonished us. They were at the tomb early in the morning.
\v 23 and when they did not find his body, they came saying that they had seen a vision of angels who said that he is alive.
\v 24 And some of those who were with us went to the tomb, and they found it just as the women had said; but they did not see him.
\v 25 And He said to them, "O foolish ones, and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken!
\v 26 Was it not necessary for the Messiah to suffer these things and then enter into His glory?
\v 27 And beginning with Moses and all the prophets, He explained to them everything that was said in all the Scriptures concerning Himself.
\v 28 As they approached the village to which they were going, Jesus acted as if He were going further.
\v 29 But they urged Him strongly, saying, "Stay with us, for it is nearly evening, and the day is almost gone." So He went in to stay with them.
\v 30 And it came to pass, when He reclined at the table with them, that He took the bread, blessed it, and breaking it, gave it to them.
\v 31 Then their eyes were opened, and they recognized Him; but He became invisible to them.
\v 32 And they said to one another, "Did not our hearts burn within us as He spoke to us on the road, while He opened to us the Scriptures?"
\v 33 And they arose that very hour and returned to Jerusalem, where they found the eleven gathered together with their companions.
\v 34 saying, "The Lord has truly risen, and He has appeared to Simon!"
\v 35 And they were recounting what had happened on the road, and how He was made known to them in the breaking of the bread.
\v 36 While they were still talking about these things, Jesus Himself stood among them and said to them, 'Peace be with you.'
\v 37 But they were startled and frightened, and thought they saw a spirit.
\v 38 And He said to them, 'Why are you so troubled, and why do doubts arise in your hearts?'
\v 39 Look at my hands and my feet; it is I myself. Touch me and see; a spirit does not have flesh and bones, as you see I have.
\v 40 And having said this, He showed them His hands and His feet.
\v 41 And while they still could not believe because of their joy and amazement, He asked them, "Do you have anything here to eat?"
\v 42 They gave Him a piece of broiled fish and some honeycomb.
\v 43 And He took it, and in their presence, He ate.
\v 44 He said to them, "These are my words that I spoke to you while I was still with you, that everything written about me in the Law of Moses, the Prophets, and the Psalms must be fulfilled."
\v 45 Then he opened their minds to understand the Scriptures.
\v 46 And he said to them, 'Thus it is written that the Christ would suffer and rise from the dead on the third day.'
\v 47 and that repentance and forgiveness of sins should be proclaimed in His name to all nations, beginning from Jerusalem.
\v 48 But you are witnesses of these things.
\v 49 And behold, I am sending the promise of my Father upon you. But stay in the city of Jerusalem until you are clothed with power from on high.
\v 50 And he led them out as far as Bethany, and lifting up his hands, he blessed them.
\v 51 And while He was blessing them, He parted from them and was taken up into heaven.
\v 52 And they worshiped Him and returned to Jerusalem with immense joy.
\v 53 And they were continually in the temple, praising and blessing God. Amen.
