\v 1 One night, a man named Nicodemus came to see Jesus. He was a Pharisee, which means he was a teacher of God's laws and a leader of the Jewish people. Nicodemus wanted to learn more about God and believed that Jesus came from God, so he had important things he wanted to ask Him.
\v 2 One night, Nicodemus, a teacher and leader of the Jewish people, came to see Jesus quietly. He wanted to learn more about Him. He said, 'Rabbi, we know you are someone sent by God because you do amazing things. No one could do those things unless God is helping him.' A Rabbi is a teacher who shows people how to know God better.
\v 3 Jesus answered him, 'You must be born again to see God's kingdom. This means you need to start fresh in your heart with God, which is like getting a special new beginning. It’s about changing your life and getting to know God so you can be with Him forever in heaven.'
\v 4 
\v 4-5 Nicodemus was still confused and asked Jesus, "How can an old person be born again? Can they go back inside their mom's tummy to be born again?" Jesus answered, "Listen carefully! No one can see God's Kingdom unless they are born again. This means they need to start a new life with God. When someone believes in me, they start to know God better. God's Spirit helps them change on the inside. Then, when they get baptized, it shows everyone that they believe in me and want to follow my way. Baptism is very important because it shows they are obeying God and starting fresh. This is how we can be with God forever!"
\v 6 When a baby is born, they come from their mom, which is just a normal way to be born. But when someone believes in Jesus, it’s like getting a special new start from God’s Spirit! This means that they change on the inside to become more like Jesus. When we get baptized, it shows everyone that we believe in Jesus and want to follow Him. This new life helps us love like God loves us, and it brings us into His family where we learn to share that love with everyone around us!
\v 7 You need to understand that everyone has to be born again to be a part of God's special family. When we believe in Jesus, it's like getting a wonderful new beginning from God's Spirit. This new life helps us to feel love in our hearts and learn to share that love with others. It shows that we want to follow Jesus and be close to God!
\v 8 The Holy Spirit is like the wind; you can’t see it, but you can feel it. Just like how you feel a nice breeze on your face, you can feel the Holy Spirit working in your heart when you believe in Jesus. He helps you love God and others in a special way. Even though we don’t see Him and don’t always know where He comes from or where He goes, you can feel the amazing changes He makes in your life. The Holy Spirit is a special gift from God, guiding and helping you as you learn to follow Jesus!
\v 9 Nicodemus was a smart teacher who was curious about what Jesus meant. He scratched his head and asked, "How can someone be born again? What does that even mean?" He couldn’t see how trusting in Jesus could change someone’s heart. Just like you can’t see the wind but can feel it blowing on your face, the Holy Spirit works inside of us when we believe in Jesus. When we have faith in Him, He helps us feel new inside and teaches us to love God and others better every day!
\v 10 Jesus answered, 'You are a teacher of God’s people, but you don’t understand what it means to be born again. It’s really important to know that when we trust in Jesus, the Holy Spirit helps change our hearts and makes us feel new inside.'
\v 11 
\v 11-12 "I want to share something really important! We talk about what we know about God, but some people still don’t believe us. If I tell you about everyday things and you don’t believe me, how can I expect you to trust me when I share about God in Heaven? Believing in Jesus helps us understand how much God loves us and opens our eyes to the wonderful truths He has for us!"
\v 13 "No one can go up to Heaven except for Jesus, who came down from there to help us. We call Him the Son of Man, which means He knows all about Heaven. He shares the truth about God, and if we believe in Him, we learn how much God loves us. Jesus is the only Savior, and He is the way to God and Heaven."
\v 14 Just like Moses held up a snake on a stick in the desert to help people get better when they were sick, Jesus will be lifted up on a cross to help us with our sins. When we look at Jesus and believe in Him, He can save us and help us be with God forever. Just like the people needed to look at the snake to feel better, we need to trust Jesus to help us. Trusting Jesus means believing that He died for our sins and rose again, so we can be forgiven. When we look to Him, He fills our hearts with hope and shows us how much God loves us!
\v 15 Everyone who believes in Jesus, God's special Son, will not be lost but will have life forever with God. Just like the people looked at the snake to be healed, we need to believe in Jesus to be saved. Jesus loves us very much, and when we believe in Him, we can be with God forever! Believing in Jesus means we trust that He died for our wrong choices, and that brings us forgiveness and hope.
\v 16 God loves everyone in the world so much that He gave us His one and only Son, Jesus, as a special gift. If you believe in Him, you will be forgiven for your mistakes and be able to be with God forever. Trusting in Jesus means you can have eternal life, which brings a happy feeling to your heart!
\v 17 God didn’t send Jesus to say we’re bad or wrong. He sent Him because He loves everyone so much! Jesus came to save us from our mistakes, not to judge us. When we believe in Jesus, He helps us be close to God and gives us a happy life with Him forever.
\v 18 If you believe in Jesus, God’s Son, you can be close to Him forever and feel His love! But if you don’t believe in Him, it’s like turning away from God, and that means you won’t get to enjoy His happiness. That’s really sad because God wants to be your friend and keep you safe with Him! Not believing in Jesus means you’re already choosing to miss out on all the good things He has for you.
\v 19 Here’s something really important: God sent Jesus to be the bright light that shows us the good things to do. Some people, though, choose to stay away from Jesus and prefer the dark. They like to do things that are wrong, and because of that, they miss out on the love and joy that God wants to give them. When they turn away from the light, it means they are not close to God, and that makes God sad because He wants to be their friend. We all have a choice: to follow Jesus, who is the light, so we can enjoy God’s love and happiness in our hearts.
\v 20 Some people decide to do wrong things, which is called sin, and they stay away from Jesus because they don’t want their mistakes to be seen. But Jesus is like a bright light that shows us how much God loves us and helps us choose better. When we try to hide from the light, we miss the joy and love that God wants to give us. God wants us to come back to Him, tell Him we’re sorry for the bad things we’ve done, and let Him help us do what’s right. He loves us so much and is always ready to forgive us when we choose to follow Him.
\v 21 When people are honest and choose to do what is right, they get closer to God. This shows everyone that the good things they do come from trusting God. God helps us do good things because He loves us, and we can show others His love through our actions.
\v 22 After that, Jesus and His friends went to Judea. There, Jesus taught everyone how to love God and each other. He baptized people to show they wanted to say sorry for their wrong choices and to follow Him. This baptism was important because it showed everyone they believed in Jesus and wanted to follow God's teachings. Jesus asked us to be baptized to show our faith and obey Him.
\v 23 At the same time, John the Baptist was in a place called Aenon, close to Salim, where there was a lot of water. Many people came to John to be baptized because they wanted to say they were sorry for their sins and show they wanted to be close to God. This baptism was special because it showed they believed in Jesus and wanted to follow God's ways. John helped them promise to be part of God’s family and to be ready for what Jesus was teaching. Being baptized was something God asked us to do to show we love Him.
\v 24 John the Baptist was in a place called Aenon, near Salim, where there was a lot of water. He was teaching people about God and helping them prepare to follow Jesus. Many people came to him because they felt sorry for the wrong things they had done and wanted to ask God for forgiveness. When they were baptized in the water, it was a special way to show they wanted to follow God and start over. John was the one who baptized them and explained how to live in God’s way. John had not been put in prison yet.
\v 25 One day, John the Baptist's friends, called disciples, were talking with a teacher from the Jewish people. They were asking him questions about how people can be made clean inside and what it means to make God happy. They learned that baptism is a special way to show we are sorry for our wrong choices and want to follow Jesus. John the Baptist explained that when we get baptized, it is like washing away our bad things and saying we want to obey God and believe in Him.
\v 26 Some of John's friends came to him and said, "Teacher, remember Jesus, the man you talked about? He's baptizing people now, and everyone is going to Him! They want to learn about God and follow Him, just like you told them to. It's so amazing! What do you think about all these people choosing to go to Him instead of us?"
\v 27 John replied, "No one can have anything good unless God gives it to them from heaven. It's like when you have a birthday party: you can only get presents if someone chooses to give them to you. Just like that, all the good things we have come from God, and those things help us learn more about Him and love Him even more!"
\v 28 John the Baptist said, 'Don't forget, I told you I am not the important person you are waiting for. I’m like a friend who helps others get ready for a big event, and that big event is Jesus coming to save us. God sent me to share this good news with you and show you just how amazing Jesus is, because He is the one who can rescue everyone!"
\v 29 John said, 'Jesus is the groom who loves his bride, and I am like his friend who helps him get ready for the big day. When I hear the groom's voice, it makes me really happy! My heart is full of joy because I get to tell everyone how special Jesus is. He is the Savior we've all been waiting for!"
\v 30 "Jesus is the one who should be number one in everyone's hearts! I want everyone to notice Him more and more. When Jesus is shining bright, it makes me super happy! I know that I have to step back so He can be in the front, and that feels amazing! I really want everyone to know how wonderful Jesus is!"
\v 31 Jesus is the greatest because He came from heaven! People on earth can only share what they see, but Jesus knows all about God because He is from above. He has a special way of understanding everything clearly! He shows us God's love with His actions and teaches us important lessons. That’s why we should pay attention to Him and believe in His words.
\v 32 Jesus tells us everything He has seen and heard from God. His words are very special because they show us the truth. We need to believe in Him because He knows what God wants us to learn. But some people don’t listen to Him or believe His words, and that means they miss out on understanding God's love and the wonderful truth He shares with us.
\v 33 When someone believes what Jesus says, they show that they really trust God. Jesus tells us the truth about God, and He wants us to understand that God is always true and real. When we believe in Jesus and listen to His special messages, we get to know God better and feel His love in our hearts!  
\v 34 God sent Jesus to tell us everything about His love and His wonderful plan. Jesus shares God's words because He is filled with the Holy Spirit, which helps Him speak the truth. This means we can trust what Jesus says, as He shows us how much God loves us and teaches us about Him.
\v 35 God loves Jesus, His one and only Son, so much! He has given Jesus the power to guide us because Jesus is very special and close to God. Jesus helps us understand God's heart and teaches us how to live in a way that makes God happy. We can fully trust Jesus because He knows what God wants for us and shows us how much God cares.
\v 36 If you believe in Jesus, you get to live forever with God, which is so wonderful! But if you don’t believe in Him, you miss out on that happy life with God. God really wants us to choose Him and be with Him because He loves us so much, and He wants everyone to be joyful together.
