\v 1 One night, a smart teacher named Nicodemus, who was a leader of the Jews and part of a group that loved God's laws, came to see Jesus. He was curious and wanted to ask Jesus questions and learn more about Him.
\v 2 One night, a Jewish teacher named Nicodemus, who was a Pharisee (which means he was a teacher of God’s laws), came to learn from Jesus. He said, 'Rabbi, we know you are from God because no one can do the miracles you do unless God is with him.'
\v 3 Jesus replied, 'Listen carefully! You must be born again to be close to God and be with Him forever.'
\v 4 
\v 4-5 Nicodemus asked Jesus, "How can someone be born again when they are already old? Can they go back into their mom's tummy to be born?" Jesus replied, "Listen carefully! No one can see God's Kingdom unless they start over in a special way. To do this, people must be born of water, which means being baptized, and also be born of God's Spirit, which is what helps us believe in Jesus and changes our hearts. This new life means that we trust in Jesus to save us and bring us close to God!"
\v 6 When a baby is born, they come from their mom, which is physical birth. But when someone believes in Jesus, they have a special spiritual birth through God's Spirit. This means they get a new heart that helps them believe in Jesus and live for God. When we get baptized, it shows that we believe in Jesus and want to follow Him. This new life helps us love others and be part of God's family, growing together with His love!
\v 7 So, I want you to understand that everyone needs to believe in Jesus to have a special new life from God, like being 'born again.' This means God gives you a new heart that helps you love others and enjoy a joyful life with Him, becoming part of His big family.
\v 8 Just like the wind blows wherever it wants, and you can hear it but can’t see where it comes from or where it goes, that’s how the Holy Spirit works in our lives. When you believe in Jesus, it’s like being born again. The Holy Spirit is a special helper that changes your heart. You can’t see it happening, but you can feel love for God and others growing inside you. This change is a wonderful gift from God that comes when you are part of His family.
\v 9 Nicodemus was a teacher and a leader who was very puzzled. He asked Jesus, "How can someone be born again? What does that even mean?" He was trying to understand what it means to believe in Jesus and how this can change your heart, like how the wind can change things even if you can't see it happening.
\v 10 Jesus said, 'You are a teacher for the people of Israel, so you should really understand how God works! It's surprising that you don’t know this yet! Learning about God is very important, and I can help you with that.'
\v 11 
\v 11-12 "I’m telling you the truth! We share what we know and what we have seen about God, but you don’t believe us. If I tell you about things we can see here on Earth and you don’t believe me, how can you trust me when I talk about things in Heaven? When you believe in God, it helps you know Him better and understand the big things He does!"
\v 13 No one has gone up to Heaven, except for Jesus, who came down from Heaven. He is called the Son of Man. He knows a lot about Heaven because He has been there. When He talks to us, He shares the truth, and when we believe in Him, we can understand God better and feel His love more!.
\v 14 Just like Moses lifted a snake on a pole to save people who were hurting, Jesus will be lifted up too. When we look to Him and believe, we can be saved and have a wonderful life forever with God. Just like the people needed to look at the snake to get better, we need to trust Jesus to help us because He loves us and is God’s Son! Our sin is serious, but when we look to Him, we find forgiveness and hope!.
\v 15 Anyone who believes in Jesus, God’s special Son, will not be lost but will have life that lasts forever with God. Just like when people looked at the snake on the pole to get better, we can look to Jesus and trust Him to save us because He loves us. He was lifted up to help us have a wonderful, never-ending life with God!
\v 16 God loves everyone so much that He gave us His one and only Son, Jesus. If you believe in Him, you won’t be away from God because of your mistakes (sins). Instead, you will live forever with God and be happy with Him!"
\v 17 God didn’t send His Son, Jesus, to point out our mistakes. He sent Jesus because He loves us so much! If we believe in Jesus, He helps us understand how to be better and forgives us for the things we do wrong. This way, we can be friends with God and enjoy a happy life with Him forever.
\v 18 If you believe in God’s Son, Jesus, you will be safe with Him and close to Him forever because God loves you! But if you don’t believe in Him, you are not close to Him, and that means you can’t enjoy His love and friendship.
\v 19 Here’s what’s really important: God sent Jesus to be a bright light that shows us how to do good things. But some people don’t want to follow the light and choose to stay in the dark, which means they are far away from God. When they stay in the dark, they miss out on God’s love and happiness. This is a big choice, and it shows that they are not living the way God wants. God loves us and wants us to be close to Him, but we have to choose to follow the light to really know His love.
\v 20 Some people choose to do bad things, and they try to hide from God’s light because they are afraid of being told they did something wrong. But God’s light is here to show us how much He loves us and to help us make better choices. When we stay in the dark, we miss out on God's happiness and love. God really wants us to come into His light, admit when we've made mistakes, and let Him help us do what is right. He loves us and is always ready to forgive us when we turn back to Him.
\v 21 But when people are honest and choose to do what is right, they come into God's light. This shows everyone that their good actions are because they want to please God and that God helps them do those good things.
\v 22 After that, Jesus and His friends went to Judea. There, Jesus taught the people how to love God and each other. He baptized people in water to show they wanted to say sorry for doing wrong things and wanted to follow Him as their leader. This baptism was a special sign that showed they believed in Jesus and wanted to be part of God's family, promising to live the way God wants us to live.
\v 23 At the same time, John the Baptist was in a place called Aenon, near Salim, where there was a lot of water. Many people came to John because they wanted to say they were sorry for the wrong things they did and wanted to be friends with God again. Baptism was a special way to show that they loved God and wanted to follow Jesus. John was helping them make a promise to follow God and be part of His family, just like Jesus was teaching everyone to do.
\v 24 At that time, John the Baptist was still teaching people about God, and he hadn’t been put in jail yet. Many people came to him to be baptized because they wanted to say sorry for the bad things they did and begin again with God. Baptism was a special sign that showed they loved God and wanted to follow the teachings of Jesus, just like John was showing them.
\v 25 Some of John the Baptist's friends, who were called disciples, were talking to a Jewish man. They wanted to understand how to be clean in God's eyes and how to make God happy. They were curious about baptism, which is when people show God they're sorry for their mistakes and want to start fresh. John the Baptist taught everyone about this special sign of love and how it helps us follow Jesus.
\v 26 Some of John's friends came to him and said, "Teacher, remember the special man you talked about? That is Jesus, the Son of God! He is baptizing people now, and many are coming to Him. Baptism shows that people want to love and follow God, just like you taught them. It's their way of saying they are sorry for their mistakes and want to start fresh with God!"
\v 27 John replied, "No one can get good things unless God gives them to us. Just like on your birthday, you can only have a gift if someone gives it to you. Remember, all good things, like love and joy, come from God's heart, and they help us grow closer to Him!"
\v 28 John the Baptist said, 'You all remember that I told you I am not the Christ, the one everyone has been waiting for. I'm like a helper who gets everyone ready to meet Him. God sent me to tell people to turn away from their wrong choices and to prepare their hearts for Jesus, the true Savior.'
\v 29 John said, 'Jesus is like a groom who loves his bride. I am like a friend who helps the groom. When I hear the groom's voice, I am so happy! My joy is full because I get to tell everyone about Jesus. He is the one everyone has been waiting for.'
\v 30 Jesus is the most important person, and He should grow bigger and bigger! I'm really happy to help everyone see how great He is. It's like when I step back so Jesus can shine brighter, that makes me joyful! I want everyone to know how amazing He is, and I'm excited to cheer for Him as He becomes even more wonderful.
\v 31 Jesus is the one who came from heaven, and He is greater than everyone! People on earth can only talk about what they know from their own experiences, and sometimes they don't see the whole picture. But Jesus knows everything about God because He comes from heaven, where He understands all the truth. That's why He is above all other people! His knowledge and power make Him truly special.
\v 32 Jesus tells us what He has seen and heard from God. He shares important truths, and it’s really important to believe Him. Some people have a hard time accepting what He says, but His message comes straight from God, and that makes it very special!
\v 33 When we believe what Jesus tells us, it shows that we trust God and know He tells the truth. Jesus is God's Son, and He shares special messages from God that help us understand what is true. Believing in Jesus is very important because it connects us to God's truth!
\v 34 God sent Jesus to tell us God’s words. Jesus speaks what God wants us to hear because the Holy Spirit is with Him. This shows how special Jesus is, and we can trust Him to share what God says.
\v 35 God loves Jesus very much and has given Him special power. This means that Jesus knows what God wants us to do. He cares for us and helps us in the right way, just like a really good leader. We can trust Jesus to guide us because He shares God's words with us.
\v 36 If you believe in Jesus, you will have eternal life with God. But if you don't believe in Him, you won't have this special life. Instead, God is sad because He wants everyone to choose to love and trust Him, just like Jesus does.
