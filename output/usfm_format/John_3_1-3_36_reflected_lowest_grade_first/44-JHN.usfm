\v 1 Now there was a man of the Pharisees, named Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews.
\v 2 This man came to Him at night and said to Him, 'Rabbi, we know that You are a teacher sent by God, for no one can perform the miraculous signs that You do unless God is with him.'
\v 3 Jesus answered him, 'Truly, truly, I say to you, unless one is born from above, he cannot enter the kingdom of God.'

*(Footnote: The phrase 'born from above' indicates a necessary spiritual rebirth, highlighting the transformative nature of faith in Christ as essential for entering God's kingdom.)*
\v 4 Nicodemus said to Him, 'How can an old man be born again? Is it possible for him to enter his mother’s womb a second time and be born?'

*(Contextual Note: The phrase 'born again' refers to a necessary spiritual rebirth for entering God's kingdom, highlighting the transformative nature of faith in Christ as explained by Jesus to Nicodemus.)*
\v 5 Jesus answered, "Truly, truly, I say to you, unless one is born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter the kingdom of God." 
*(Contextual Note: 'Born of water' indicates the importance of baptism, while 'born of the Spirit' signifies the essential spiritual rebirth necessary for entering God's kingdom.)*
\v 6 That which has been birthed from the flesh is flesh, and that which has been birthed from the Spirit is spirit. 
*(Theological Note: This verse draws a clear distinction between physical birth, which results in a human existence, and spiritual birth, which gives rise to a new spiritual identity. It underscores the necessity of spiritual rebirth for entering into a true relationship with God, linking this concept to the broader discourse on regeneration in the preceding verses.)*
\v 7 "Do not marvel that I said to you, 'You must be born again from above.'"  
*(Contextual Note: 'Born from above' signifies the necessity of spiritual rebirth, emphasizing its importance for entering the kingdom of God.)*
\v 8 "The Spirit blows where it wills, and you hear its voice; yet you do not know where it comes from or where it goes. So it is with everyone who has been born of the Spirit."  

*(Contextual Note: This verse highlights the sovereign and mysterious nature of the work of the Holy Spirit in spiritual rebirth, illustrating that while the activity of the Spirit may be perceived, its origins and destinations remain beyond human understanding.)*
\v 9 Nicodemus answered and said to Him, "How can these things be?"
\v 10 Jesus answered and said to him, 'You are Israel's instructor, and yet you do not understand these things?'  
*(Footnote: As a Pharisee and prominent instructor of the law, Nicodemus was expected to possess profound spiritual insight. Jesus's question serves as a rhetorical challenge, illustrating the disconnect between Nicodemus's academic knowledge of the law and the profound spiritual truths being presented, underscoring the limitations of mere scholarly understanding in light of divine revelation.)*
\v 11 Truly, truly, I say to you, we speak of what we know and testify to what we have seen, yet you do not accept our testimony.
\v 12 "If I have told you about earthly things and you do not believe, how will you believe if I tell you about heavenly things?"  
*(Contextual Note: This verse emphasizes the necessity of faith to grasp spiritual truths, highlighting the challenge of understanding divine concepts when foundational earthly ideas are not accepted.)*
\v 13 "And no one has ascended into heaven except the Son of Man, who came down from heaven and is in heaven."  
*(Footnote: This verse highlights the unique authority of Jesus Christ as the only mediator between God and humanity, emphasizing His dual nature as both divine and human, and underscoring the importance of His mission on earth as the incarnate Son of God.)*
\v 14 "And just as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, so must the Son of Man be lifted up." 
*(Contextual Note: This verse draws a parallel between Moses lifting the serpent as a means of healing for the Israelites and the necessity of Jesus's crucifixion, illustrating how faith in Christ serves as the means of spiritual salvation, echoing the redemptive purpose of His sacrifice.)*
\v 15 "so that everyone who believes in Him will not perish, but may have everlasting life." *(Contextual Note: This verse encapsulates the Christian doctrine of salvation through faith in Jesus Christ. The phrase 'will not perish' affirms the assurance of salvation for genuine believers, signifying that true faith not only transforms one’s eternal destiny but also influences daily living. 'Everlasting life' refers not just to the length of existence but to a quality of life enriched by a personal relationship with God, characterized by peace, joy, and purpose. In conservative Christian thought, this passage underscores that authentic belief is reflected in a life committed to living according to Christ's teachings, embodying the transformative power of faith in all aspects of life.)*
\v 16 "For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, so that everyone who believes in Him may not perish but have eternal life."  
*(Theological Note: This verse powerfully illustrates the depth of God's love for humanity, showing that giving His only begotten Son represents the ultimate sacrifice. Belief in Jesus is essential for eternal life, indicating that true faith transforms not only one’s eternal destiny but also fosters a profound relationship with God.)*
\v 17 For God did not send His Son into the world to condemn the world, but that the world might be saved through Him.
\v 18 He who believes in Him is not condemned; but he who does not believe is already condemned, because he has not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God.
\v 19 "And this is the verdict: the light has come into the world, and people loved darkness more than the light, because their deeds were evil."  
*(Footnote: In this passage, 'light' symbolizes divine truth and God's presence, while 'darkness' signifies spiritual ignorance and moral failure. The preference for darkness indicates a rejection of God's truth, illustrating the conflict between divine righteousness and human sinfulness. This serves as a reminder of moral accountability in response to God's revelation.)*
\v 20 For everyone who practices evil hates the light and does not come into the light so that his deeds will not be exposed.
*(Footnote: 'Light' in John's theology represents truth and righteousness, while 'deeds' refers to one's actions that can be judged by God. The rejection of the light signifies a preference for darkness and a life not aligned with divine truth.)*
\v 21 But the one who practices the Truth comes into the light, so that his works are evident, having been accomplished in God.
*(Contextual Note: This verse underscores the importance of living in accordance with God's Truth and coming into His light, suggesting that true alignment with God's will is evidenced by one’s actions being reflective of divine intention and righteousness.)*
\v 22 After this, Jesus and his disciples went into Judea, and there he remained with them and baptized.
\v 23 John was also baptizing at Aenon near Salim, because there was plenty of water there; and people were coming and being baptized.
\v 24 For John had not yet been thrown into prison.
\v 25 Then a dispute arose between some of John’s disciples and a Jew about ritual purification.
\v 26 And they came to John and said to him, 'Rabbi, the one who was with you across the Jordan, whom you have testified about, look, he is baptizing, and everyone is going to him.'
\v 27 John answered and said, 'A man cannot receive anything unless it has been bestowed upon him from Heaven.'
\v 28 You yourselves testify that I said, 'I am not the Christ, but I am the forerunner sent before Him.'
\v 29 The one who possesses the bride is the bridegroom; but the friend of the bridegroom, who stands and listens to him, rejoices greatly at the bridegroom's voice. Therefore, my joy has been made full.
\v 30 "He must increase, but I must decrease."  
*(Contextual Note: This profound declaration by John the Baptist illustrates the essence of his mission as the forerunner of Christ. 'He must increase' signifies that Christ's authority, presence, and influence should grow in the hearts of believers, while 'I must decrease' reflects John's humility and willingness to step aside, acknowledging that Christ must be exalted. This teaches contemporary believers the vital importance of prioritizing Christ above all else, recognizing that true greatness is found in humility and service to Him. John’s statement calls Christians to evaluate their lives in relation to Christ's mission, encouraging them to diminish self and allow Christ to shine forth through their actions and witness.)*
\v 31 He who comes from above is above all; the one who is from the earth is earthly and speaks in an earthly manner. He who comes from heaven is above all.
\v 32 "And what he has seen and heard, this is what he testifies; yet no one accepts his testimony."
\v 33 "The one who accepts his testimony seals that God is true." 

*Footnote: This affirmation signifies the believer's trust in the integrity of God's character as revealed through His Son. Accepting Christ's testimony not only demonstrates faith but also underscores the divine authority of His words and the truth of God's promises, encouraging believers to embrace His nature.*
\v 34 "For the one whom God has sent speaks God's words; for God gives the Spirit without measure." 

*Footnote: The phrase 'without measure' emphasizes the limitless and abundant nature of the Spirit given by God, indicating that the fullness of the Spirit is bestowed upon Jesus, empowering Him to fulfill His divine mission and to reveal the fullness of God to humanity.*
\v 35 The Father loves the Son and has given all things into His hand.
\v 36 The one who believes in the Son has eternal life; but the one who does not believe in the Son does not have life, but the wrath of God remains upon him.
