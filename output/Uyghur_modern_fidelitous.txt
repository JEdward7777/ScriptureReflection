Working on verse LUK 1:9 which has grade 73.33333333333333

The peer reviews highlight that the current Uyghur translation of Luke 1:9 faithfully represents the conservative Christian theological meaning but uses cumbersome and somewhat archaic phrasing that hinders readability and naturalness for contemporary readers. The phrase "شۇ چاغدىكى كاھىنلىق ئادىتى بويىچە" is wordy and formal, and the translation of "he was chosen by lot" as "چەك تاشلىغاندا شۇنداق بولدىكى، چەك ئۇنىڭغا چىقتى" is awkward, unclear, and confusing due to the repeated use of "چەك". Reviewers suggest replacing these with clearer and more idiomatic expressions such as "بەختى بىلەن تاللانغاندا" or "نۆۋىتى كېلىپ، تەڭشەش ئارقىلىق تاللانغاندا" to better convey the concept of selection by lot. Overall, the translation needs refinement in style and vocabulary to enhance flow, clarity, and naturalness for modern Uyghur readers while preserving doctrinal fidelity.

The peer reviews affirm that the current translation of Luke 1:68 accurately conveys the conservative Christian meaning of God's blessing, visitation, and redemption of His people, faithful to the Greek text. However, multiple reviewers note that the phrasing tends toward a formal, somewhat archaic, and slightly cumbersome style that could benefit from modernization for contemporary Uyghur readers. Specifically, the expressions "يوقلاپ، ئۇلاردىن خەۋەر ئېلىپ" (visited, took news from them) are awkward and could be replaced with smoother, more natural phrasing to better express God's gracious visitation. Similarly, the phrase "بەدەل تۆلەپ ئۇلارنى ھۆر قىلدى" (paid a ransom and freed them) may overemphasize a financial transaction aspect and could be softened or made more fluid to emphasize divine salvation and deliverance without losing theological accuracy. Overall, the corrections suggest revising the translation to enhance readability and natural flow in modern Uyghur while maintaining doctrinal soundness and faithful reflection of the original Greek text.

The translation of Luke 1:37 faithfully communicates the conservative Christian message that nothing is impossible with God. However, to improve naturalness and fluency in contemporary Uyghur, it is recommended to revise the phrasing to a more concise and positively framed expression, for example, 'چۈنكى خۇدا بىلەن ھېچ نەرسە ئىمكىن بولمايدۇ'. Also, consider removing the ending '، ــ دېدى' unless the context explicitly requires direct speech, to maintain textual fidelity and smoother flow. Implementing these changes will enhance readability while preserving theological integrity.

The translation of Luke 1:17 is faithful to the original Greek and maintains a conservative Christian perspective, accurately conveying theological elements such as the spirit and power of Elijah and the preparation of God's people. However, the style is somewhat formal, heavy, and complex, which may reduce naturalness and readability for a modern Uyghur audience. To improve, simplify sentence structures and choose more contemporary, idiomatic expressions that flow smoothly while preserving theological accuracy. Avoid unnecessary speech tags like "ـ دېدى" at the end, as they are not in the original text and can disrupt the flow. Additionally, consider rephrasing repeated or cumbersome phrases such as "رەبنىڭ ئالدىدا" and "ئىلىياس پەيغەمبەرگە خاس بولغان روھ ۋە كۈچ-قۇدرەتتە بولۇپ" for greater fluidity. Implementing these changes will result in a clearer, more natural, and accessible translation without sacrificing doctrinal fidelity.

Working on verse LUK 1:17 which has grade 86.33333333333333

The translation of Luke 1:17 accurately reflects conservative Christian theology and the original Greek text, effectively communicating key concepts such as the spirit and power of Elijah, turning hearts, and preparing God's people. However, the language is somewhat formal, archaic, and occasionally awkward for modern Uyghur readers. To improve, revise key phrases like "turning the hearts of the fathers to the children" to be more natural and clear, and adjust "turning the disobedient into pure worshipers" to better match the Greek idea of turning disobedient persons to the wisdom of the righteous. The expression about preparing a people for the Lord should be made more active and fluid. Avoid unnecessary speech tags and complex sentence structures to enhance readability. Implementing these changes will produce a modern, natural, and doctrinally faithful Uyghur translation of Luke 1:17.

The peer review confirms the translation of LUK 1:78-79 is doctrinally faithful and conveys the theological meaning well. However, to improve the translation, it is recommended to: 1) Replace the somewhat poetic and archaic phrase "ئەرشتىن تاڭ شەپىقى ئۈستىمىزگە چۈشۈپ يوقلىدى" with a smoother, more modern expression to enhance naturalness and readability. 2) Use clearer and more contemporary Uyghur terms for "dawn from on high," such as "ئەسماندىن" (from heaven), to aid comprehension. 3) Adjust sentence flow and rhythm for a more fluent, conversational tone without losing reverence or theological accuracy. 4) Consider rearranging phrases or adding connective words (e.g., "ئەمدى") to better link cause and effect and improve the overall naturalness of the text. Implementing these stylistic refinements will preserve doctrinal integrity while making the translation more accessible and engaging to modern Uyghur readers.

The peer reviewers unanimously affirm that the current translation of Luke 1:19 is accurate and theologically faithful to the original Greek text, preserving conservative Christian doctrine clearly. However, they consistently suggest improving the stylistic presentation by adopting a more contemporary, natural, and fluid Uyghur style. Specifically, formal expressions like 'خۇدانىڭ ھۇزۇرىدا تۇرغۇچى جەبرائىلمەن' ('Gabriel who stands before God') and 'مەن ئەۋەتىلدىم' ('I have been sent') could be softened or rephrased to enhance readability and better connect with modern Uyghur speakers without compromising theological precision. The translation should maintain clarity and doctrinal soundness while achieving a more conversational and accessible tone.

Working on verse LUK 1:19 which has grade 86.66666666666667

The translation of Luke 1:19 is theologically accurate and faithfully reflects the original Greek text from a conservative Christian perspective. The angel Gabriel's identity and mission are clearly conveyed. The primary suggested correction is to revise the phrasing to adopt a more contemporary, natural, and conversational Uyghur style. This involves softening formal expressions such as "مەن خۇدا تەرىپىدىن ئەۋەتىلگەن جەبرائىل" ("Gabriel sent by God") and "سىزگە بۇ خۇش خەۋەرنى ئېيتىشقا كەلدىم" ("I have come to tell you this good news") to enhance readability and engagement for modern Uyghur speakers. These stylistic changes should maintain theological fidelity and reverence, ensuring the translation remains doctrinally sound and accessible without altering the core message or content.

Working on verse LUK 1:18 which has grade 87.83333333333333

The translation of Luke 1:18 is theologically sound and faithful to the Greek text, preserving the conservative Christian interpretation of Zacharias' doubt due to advanced age. All reviewers agree the vocabulary and sentence structure are clear and respectful. However, the key area for improvement lies in refining the phrase "مەنمۇ قېرىپ قالغان، ئايالىممۇ خېلى ياشىنىپ قالغان تۇرسا." Although accurate and understandable, it feels somewhat formal, literal, and less natural in modern Uyghur. It is recommended to rephrase this segment using smoother, more colloquial, and conversational expressions to enhance readability and better engage contemporary Uyghur audiences, while maintaining the original meaning and reverence. Overall, minor stylistic adjustments will strengthen the translation's flow without sacrificing theological fidelity.

Working on verse LUK 1:11 which has grade 88.0

The translation of Luke 1:11 accurately reflects the original Greek and maintains conservative Christian theological fidelity, especially in identifying the 'angel of the Lord' and his position next to the altar of incense. Reviewers suggest removing or reconsidering the adverb 'تۇيۇقسىز' ('suddenly') as it is not explicitly in the original text and may affect literal accuracy. The phrase rendering 'on the right side of the altar of incense' is correct but somewhat formal; revising this expression to a more natural and contemporary Uyghur phrase would enhance readability. Overall, simplifying sentence structure and updating wording to a more current style is recommended to improve flow and engagement while preserving doctrinal meaning and clarity.

The peer review comments collectively commend the translation's faithfulness to the original Greek text and conservative Christian interpretation, effectively conveying Elizabeth's recognition of God's gracious intervention. However, several reviewers suggest improving the naturalness and contemporary readability of the Uyghur language used. Specifically, the phrase "نومۇسقا قېلىشتىن خالاس قىلىپ" (delivered from reproach) could be made clearer or more idiomatic to better capture the nuance. Additionally, formal expressions like "شاپائەت كۆرسەتتى" (showed mercy) might be softened or modernized to sound more conversational while maintaining theological reverence. A slight simplification or rephrasing to improve flow and accessibility is recommended without compromising accuracy or the conservative Christian message. Overall, the translation successfully balances faithfulness and clarity but can be enhanced by adopting a more natural, fluid style suited to contemporary Uyghur readers.

Working on verse LUK 1:25 which has grade 86.66666666666667

The peer review consensus for Luke 1:25 suggests the Uyghur translation is theologically faithful and maintains a conservative Christian perspective effectively. However, the wording tends toward formal, somewhat archaic expressions that reduce naturalness and contemporary readability. To improve, it is recommended to replace "قىيىنچىلىقلىرىمنى" (my difficulties) with terms directly expressing reproach or shame like "ئۈرۈم-بوزۇقىمنى" or "خەجلەنگەن ھالىتىم." The phrase "بۈيۈك نېمەربەرلىك قىلدى" (gave great mercy) should be rephrased to sound more conversational and clearer, perhaps by explicitly stating "showed great mercy" or "did great things for me." Additionally, phrases describing deliverance from disgrace among people should be made smoother and more fluid in modern Uyghur. These stylistic improvements will enhance the translation's accessibility and natural flow without compromising theological accuracy or conservative interpretation. The edit history supports focusing solely on improving naturalness and clarity without adding or removing doctrinal content.

The peer review advises improving the naturalness and contemporary readability of the Uyghur translation of Luke 1:25 by replacing the phrase "ئۈرۈم-بوزۇقىمدىن قۇتۇلدۇرۇپ" with a more idiomatic and clear expression for "disgrace among people." Similarly, the phrase "مېھرى-شەپقەت قىلدى" should be softened or modernized to sound more conversational without losing theological reverence. These changes should enhance fluidity and accessibility for modern Uyghur readers while strictly maintaining doctrinal fidelity and avoiding the addition or removal of content.

Working on verse LUK 1:26-27 which has grade 88.33333333333333

The translation of Luke 1:26-27 is accurate and faithful to the original Greek text, correctly conveying key conservative Christian theological details, such as the angel Gabriel's mission, Mary's virginity, and her betrothal to Joseph of David's house. The language is respectful and clear, preserving doctrinal integrity. However, the phrasing, especially 'sent to a pure girl' (پاک بىر قىزنىڭ قېشىغا ئەۋەتىلدى), while understandable, is somewhat formal, traditional, and less natural in contemporary Uyghur. To improve, it is recommended to adopt a more fluid, modern, and idiomatic Uyghur expression that enhances readability and flow without sacrificing theological accuracy or reverence. Slight simplification and natural phrasing would better balance faithfulness with accessibility and meet the objective of a contemporary style.

Working on verse LUK 1:26-27 which has grade 87.5

The peer review indicates that the translation of Luke 1:26-27 accurately and faithfully conveys the conservative Christian meaning but can be improved stylistically. Recommended actions include: 1) Replacing formal and indirect phrases like 'a newly engaged girl named Mary' with more natural, fluent, and idiomatic contemporary Uyghur expressions that clearly convey Mary as a virgin betrothed to Joseph. 2) Removing unnecessary additions not present in the original Greek text, such as references to Elizabeth's six-month pregnancy, to prevent confusion. 3) Simplifying sentence structures to enhance readability and flow without compromising theological accuracy. 4) Maintaining all key doctrinal details, including Gabriel's divine mission, Mary's virginity, and Joseph's lineage from David. These changes aim to balance faithfulness, doctrinal integrity, and modern naturalness to produce a clearer, more accessible, and reverent Uyghur Bible text.

Working on verse LUK 1:72-75 which has grade 88.5

The peer reviews affirm that the translation of Luke 1:72-75 faithfully conveys the conservative Christian theological meaning, emphasizing God's mercy, the holy covenant with Abraham, and deliverance from enemies to serve God in holiness and righteousness. However, the translation could be improved stylistically to sound more natural, contemporary, and fluid in modern Uyghur. Specific phrases such as 'ئىلتىپات ئەيلەپ' (showing mercy), 'مۇقەددەس ئەھدىسىنى ئەمەلگە ئاشۇرۇش' (fulfilling the holy covenant), and 'خىزمەت-ئىبادىتىدە بولىدىغان قىلدى' (to serve Him) were noted as somewhat formal or less conversational. Recommendations include smoothing and simplifying certain expressions without losing doctrinal accuracy, aiming for clearer, more accessible, and more natural language that maintains theological fidelity while enhancing readability for modern Uyghur readers.

The peer reviews affirm that the translation faithfully preserves conservative Christian theological elements from Luke 1:72-75, accurately reflecting God's mercy, remembrance of the holy covenant, and deliverance to serve God in holiness and righteousness. However, to enhance readability and naturalness for modern Uyghur readers, it is recommended to: 1) smooth and simplify some formal or heavy expressions (e.g., phrases like 'بىزنىڭ ئاتا-بۇۋىلارغا بولغان قەسىمىنى ئەسلەپ' and 'پەقەت ئۇنىڭغا خىزمەت قىلىشنى، پاكىزلىق ۋە ئادىللىق بىلەن يېشىشنى ئەمەلگە ئاشۇرۇشقا يول قويىدۇ'); 2) correct typographical inconsistencies such as the use of Latin 'q' in 'مۇqەddəs'; and 3) ensure sentence flow is more contemporary and fluid without compromising doctrinal accuracy. These refinements will improve naturalness and readability while fully respecting conservative Christian theological fidelity. No content additions or doctrinal changes are advised.

The translation of Luke 1:6 accurately conveys the original Greek meaning and maintains conservative Christian theological fidelity. However, the style is formal and somewhat archaic, which may reduce readability for modern Uyghur speakers. To improve, revise the language to adopt a more natural, contemporary, and conversational tone—particularly replacing phrases like 'ماڭاتتى' and 'ئەيىبسىز ماڭاتتى' with more current expressions that convey 'walked blamelessly' while preserving reverence and doctrinal accuracy. These stylistic adjustments will enhance readability and accessibility without compromising theological integrity.

The translation of Luke 1:6 is accurate and theologically faithful, properly reflecting the original Greek and maintaining conservative Christian doctrine. However, the language style is formal and somewhat archaic, which reduces readability and naturalness for modern Uyghur readers. Reviewers recommend revising the wording to adopt a more contemporary, natural, and conversational Uyghur style—particularly replacing phrases like 'سادىق ۋە پاراڭسىز' and 'ئەيىبسىز ماڭغان ئىدى' with more current expressions that convey righteousness and blameless walking. These stylistic adjustments should preserve reverence and doctrinal accuracy while enhancing accessibility and flow. No content or theological changes are advised, only stylistic refinement to better suit modern Uyghur audiences.

The translation of Luke 1:6 accurately and faithfully conveys the original Greek text and conservative Christian theology, clearly expressing the righteousness and blamelessness of both individuals before God, along with their obedience to all the Lord's commandments. However, to improve accessibility and readability for modern Uyghur speakers, it is recommended to revise certain expressions that feel formal or slightly archaic. Specifically, replacing phrases like 'نېفىس ۋە پاراڭسىز' with more natural contemporary synonyms for 'blameless' or 'pure,' and rephrasing 'پەرۋەردىگارنىڭ بارلىق ئەمر-قائىدىلىرىغا ئەمەلباپ رىئايە قىلدى' to a more fluid and conversational style, would enhance the translation's flow without compromising theological accuracy or reverence. These stylistic refinements will make the text more approachable while maintaining its doctrinal integrity, aligning well with previous efforts to balance faithfulness and modern readability.

Working on verse LUK 1:26-27 which has grade 89.0

The peer review confirms that the current translation of Luke 1:26-27 faithfully reflects the original Greek text and conservative Christian theology, accurately conveying Gabriel's divine mission, Mary's virginity, and Joseph's Davidic lineage. However, it recommends improving stylistic aspects to achieve a more natural, fluent, and contemporary Uyghur expression. Specifically, the phrase describing Mary as 'a virgin betrothed to Joseph' should be rephrased to avoid formal, archaic, or cumbersome wording such as 'تۇرغان، يىنى ئۇنىڭغا توي قىلىشقا بېرىلگەن قىز.' Instead, a simpler and more idiomatic expression (e.g., 'تويغا بېرىلگەن قىزى') is preferred to enhance readability and flow. The reviewers advise against adding details not present in the original text (like Elizabeth's pregnancy) to prevent confusion and maintain doctrinal integrity. Overall, the translation meets theological and faithfulness criteria but benefits from minor stylistic modernization to balance reverence with accessibility for contemporary readers.

Working on verse LUK 1:26-27 which has grade 83.83333333333333

The peer review corrections for Luke 1:26-27 focus on improving the translation's stylistic naturalness while preserving conservative Christian theological accuracy. Specifically, the phrase translating "a virgin betrothed to a man" should be revised from the somewhat formal and archaic "تويغا بېرىلگەن قىز" (a girl given in marriage) to a more natural and idiomatic Uyghur expression, such as "تويغا بەل باغلىغان ئايال" (a woman betrothed to someone), to enhance readability and flow. The translation must avoid adding extraneous details like Elizabeth's pregnancy, which are not present in the original Greek text, to prevent confusion and maintain doctrinal integrity. Sentence structure should be simplified for smoother, more contemporary reading while ensuring that all key theological points—Gabriel's divine mission, Mary's virginity, and Joseph's lineage from David—are clearly and respectfully conveyed. Implementing these stylistic refinements will better balance faithfulness and accessibility, producing a clear, reverent, and modern Uyghur Bible text.

The peer review confirms that the translation of Luke 1:26-27 is faithful to the original Greek text and conservatively Christian theology, accurately portraying the angel Gabriel's divine mission, Mary's virginity, and Joseph's Davidic lineage. However, all reviewers recommend improving stylistic naturalness by replacing the somewhat archaic and formal phrase "تويغا بەل باغلىغان" (betrothed) with a more natural, idiomatic, and contemporary Uyghur expression that clearly conveys Mary's virgin betrothal to Joseph. The translation should avoid adding any extraneous details not present in the original text, such as references to Elizabeth's pregnancy, which have been rightly removed in previous versions. Sentence structures should be simplified to enhance readability and flow while preserving doctrinal accuracy and reverence. Implementing these stylistic refinements will better balance faithfulness and accessibility, resulting in a clearer, more fluent, and reverent contemporary Uyghur Bible translation.

The peer reviews consistently affirm that the translation faithfully conveys the original Greek text's conservative Christian theological content, including Gabriel's divine mission, Mary's virginity, and Joseph's Davidic lineage. However, reviewers recommend stylistic improvements to produce a more natural, fluent, and contemporary Uyghur rendering. Specifically, the phrase describing Mary as 'betrothed' should be simplified and expressed with more idiomatic, less formal or archaic language to enhance readability and flow. Additionally, avoid adding any details not present in the original text, such as references to Elizabeth's pregnancy, which have been intentionally removed to maintain doctrinal accuracy and prevent confusion. Sentence structures should be simplified where possible without sacrificing theological integrity or reverence. Implementing these refinements will balance faithfulness with accessibility, resulting in a clear, reverent, and modern Uyghur Bible text for Luke 1:26-27.

The peer reviews affirm that the translation of Luke 1:26-27 accurately preserves key conservative Christian theological elements: the angel Gabriel's divine mission, Mary's virginity, and Joseph's Davidic lineage. Importantly, any extraneous details not present in the original Greek text—such as references to Elizabeth's pregnancy—have been correctly omitted to avoid confusion and maintain doctrinal integrity.

The primary corrections focus on enhancing the translation's style for a more natural, contemporary, and idiomatic Uyghur expression. Specifically, formal and somewhat cumbersome phrases like "تۇتۇشقا پىلانلىغان پەرزەنتسىز قىزى" (a virgin girl planning to be betrothed) should be replaced with smoother, more fluent alternatives that clearly and respectfully convey Mary's status as a virgin betrothed to Joseph. Likewise, phrases such as "تويغا بەل باغلىغان" should be modernized for better readability.

Sentence structures should be simplified where possible to improve flow and accessibility without sacrificing theological accuracy or reverence. These refinements aim to produce a clear, reverent, and accessible contemporary Uyghur Bible text that remains faithful to the original text and conservative Christian doctrine.

The peer reviews affirm that the translation of Luke 1:26-27 is faithful to the original Greek and conservatively Christian in theological content, clearly portraying Gabriel's divine mission, Mary's virginity, and Joseph's Davidic lineage. However, improvements are needed in stylistic naturalness and clarity in contemporary Uyghur. Specifically, the phrase describing Mary as "بەل باغلانغان، پەرزەنتسىز بولغان بىر قىز" (betrothed, childless girl) is awkward, redundant, and less natural. "پەرزەنتسىز" (childless) is unnecessary since the Greek term "παρθένον" emphasizes virginity, not mere childlessness, so a more precise, idiomatic expression explicitly conveying Mary's virginity should replace it. Similarly, "بەل باغلانغان" (betrothed) should be rendered with smoother, more idiomatic language that conveys the solemn, covenantal nature of betrothal clearly and respectfully. Sentence structures should be simplified to enhance readability and flow without sacrificing doctrinal integrity or reverence. The translation must avoid adding any extraneous content not present in the original text, such as references to Elizabeth's pregnancy, to maintain doctrinal accuracy and prevent confusion. Implementing these stylistic refinements will better balance faithfulness, accessibility, and reverence, resulting in a clearer, more fluent, and modern Uyghur Bible text consistent with conservative Christian theology.

Working on verse LUK 1:25 which has grade 89.16666666666667

The peer review highlights that the current translation of Luke 1:25 is theologically faithful and effectively conveys the conservative Christian message of God's compassionate removal of reproach and restoration of joy. However, to enhance naturalness and contemporary fluency in Uyghur, it is recommended to rephrase certain formal or somewhat archaic expressions. Specifically, the phrase "مېنىڭغا مۇھەببەت بىلەن مۇئامىلە قىلدى" should be softened or modernized to sound more conversational yet reverent. Additionally, expressions describing deliverance from shame or reproach among people should be made smoother and more idiomatic to improve clarity and readability. These adjustments should focus solely on stylistic and linguistic refinement without altering doctrinal content or adding new material. Overall, the translation can be improved by adopting a more natural and fluid style suited to modern Uyghur readers while maintaining strict theological accuracy and conservative interpretation.

The peer review suggests that while the Uyghur translation of Luke 1:25 is theologically accurate and preserves a conservative Christian perspective, it requires stylistic improvements to enhance readability and naturalness. Specifically, reviewers recommend simplifying or rephrasing formal and somewhat archaic expressions such as "باردەك كېلەردىغان قىيىنچىلىقلىرىمنى," "مەن بىلەن باغلانغان ئەپسۇس-ئاشۇبلارنى," and "مەھرى-مەھەببىتى بىلەن يانداشتى" to more natural and fluid contemporary Uyghur language. The translation should focus on conveying the Lord's gracious removal of reproach and the resulting joy in a clearer, more accessible manner. These changes must avoid adding or omitting doctrinal content, maintaining strict theological fidelity and conservative interpretation. Overall, the goal is to produce a more conversational, smooth, and accessible version suited to modern Uyghur readers while fully preserving the original biblical meaning.

Working on verse LUK 1:25 which has grade 80.0

Peer reviewers agree that the translation accurately reflects the core message of Luke 1:25 from a conservative Christian perspective but needs stylistic refinement. They recommend simplifying verbose or cumbersome phrases related to hardships and reproach, making expressions more idiomatic and natural in contemporary Uyghur. Added interpretive phrases about God's personal love or transforming the speaker into a joyful person should be removed to maintain fidelity to the Greek text. The translation should focus on clearly and concisely stating that the Lord removed Elizabeth's reproach among people, resulting in her restoration and joy. Enhancing readability and flow without introducing doctrinal changes or additions is essential to meet both theological accuracy and modern language standards.

The peer review consensus affirms that the current translation of Luke 1:25 is theologically faithful and maintains a conservative Christian viewpoint. However, to enhance naturalness and readability in contemporary Uyghur, it is recommended to replace the term "سىزىلىشىمنى" (my reproach), which is somewhat archaic or less common, with a more idiomatic and natural modern expression conveying "reproach" or "disgrace." Additionally, the phrase "ئادەملەر ئارىسىدىكى" (among people) could be refined for smoother, more fluid phrasing to improve flow and accessibility. The sentence structure overall should be made more natural and conversational without compromising theological accuracy. Importantly, no additions or removals of doctrinal content are advised; the corrections focus solely on stylistic and lexical improvements to produce a clear, faithful, and accessible translation suited to modern Uyghur readers while upholding a conservative Christian interpretation.

The peer reviews consistently affirm that the translation of Luke 1:25 is theologically faithful and aligns with a conservative Christian viewpoint. However, the current phrasing uses somewhat archaic or formal terms, notably the word "ھۆرۇن" for "reproach" or "disgrace," which diminishes naturalness and contemporary readability in Uyghur. Additionally, the metaphorical expression "يۇتۇپ كېتىپتۇ" ("has swallowed up") is considered less natural and somewhat colloquial for a reverent Bible translation. Reviewers recommend replacing "ھۆرۇن" with a more common, idiomatic, and contemporary Uyghur term that clearly conveys "reproach" or "disgrace" in a natural style. Similarly, the phrase conveying removal or taking away should be rendered in a smoother, clearer, and more fluid manner suitable for modern Uyghur readers, avoiding literal or awkward metaphors. Importantly, all stylistic revisions must preserve strict theological accuracy and avoid adding or removing doctrinal content, maintaining the conservative Christian interpretation intact. The overall goal is to enhance the translation's naturalness, accessibility, and readability for contemporary Uyghur speakers while fully respecting the original Greek meaning and conservative theological perspective.

Working on verse LUK 1:25 which has grade 76.5

The peer reviews affirm that the current Uyghur translation of Luke 1:25 accurately reflects the conservative Christian theological message but is stylistically formal, complex, and unnatural in contemporary usage. The key issue is the cumbersome phrase describing reproach and disgrace, which introduces unnecessary interpretative elements like ignorance and darkness not found in the original Greek. Reviewers recommend simplifying this to a clear, idiomatic, and natural expression that directly conveys the Lord's removal of shame or reproach among people. The translation should avoid convoluted, indirect, or archaic language and refrain from adding content beyond the original text. Overall, the correction requires improving naturalness, clarity, and fluidity to make the passage accessible to modern Uyghur readers while preserving strict theological accuracy and a conservative Christian perspective.

The translation of Luke 1:58 is faithful to the Greek text and aligns well with a conservative Christian viewpoint, accurately conveying the Lord's great mercy and the rejoicing of Elizabeth's neighbors and relatives. However, to improve readability and modern naturalness in contemporary Uyghur, the phrase "پەرۋەردىگارنىڭ ئۇنىڭغا كۆرسەتكەن مېھىر-شەپقىتىنى شۇنچە ئۇلغايتقانلىقىنى" should be simplified and streamlined. Attention should be given to avoid implying nuances not explicit in the original text, such as the suggestion of an increase in mercy where the Greek simply states its greatness. Additionally, minor stylistic adjustments could enhance flow and clarity while maintaining theological depth and accuracy. Overall, the translation is strong but could benefit from these refinements for better naturalness and reader comprehension.

The translation accurately and faithfully expresses the conservative Christian theological message of God's mercy to Israel as promised to Abraham and his descendants. However, the style is somewhat formal and literal, with phrases like 'He remembered His mercy' feeling heavy or cumbersome in contemporary Uyghur. To improve, the translation should be adjusted for greater naturalness and fluidity, adopting a more conversational and modern tone that enhances readability and engagement while preserving doctrinal accuracy. Slight rephrasing and sentence restructuring are recommended to balance faithfulness with a natural, accessible style suited for today's readers.

The current translation of Luke 1:54-55 accurately conveys the conservative Christian theological message about God's mercy to Israel and His eternal promise to Abraham and his descendants. However, peer reviewers recommend stylistic improvements to make the translation more natural, fluent, and contemporary in Uyghur. Specifically, phrases like "خۇدا ئىسرائىل قۇلى بولغان خەلقىگە ئۆزىنىڭ شەپقىتىنى كۆرسەتتى" and "بىزنىڭ ئاتا-بوبالىرىمىز بولغان" should be rephrased into more conversational and idiomatic Uyghur expressions that improve readability and flow without altering the meaning or doctrinal content. The goal is to maintain theological accuracy and reverence while adopting a modern, accessible style that resonates with contemporary readers. No changes to content or doctrine are needed; the focus is on stylistic modernization and naturalness.

The translation of Luke 1:54-55 is theologically accurate and faithful to the Greek text, effectively conveying the conservative Christian message about God's mercy to Israel and His covenant promises to Abraham and his descendants. However, the style is formal, somewhat dense, and literal, which reduces its naturalness and readability for contemporary Uyghur audiences. To improve, the translation should be revised to adopt a more conversational, fluent, and modern Uyghur style by simplifying sentence structures, rephrasing formal expressions into idiomatic language, and streamlining phrasing to enhance flow and engagement. These adjustments should preserve doctrinal accuracy and reverence while making the text more accessible and natural for today's readers. No content additions or doctrinal alterations are necessary; focus solely on stylistic modernization and improved readability.

The translation of Luke 1:54-55 accurately and faithfully conveys the conservative Christian theological message regarding God's mercy to Israel and His eternal covenant with Abraham and his descendants. However, peer reviewers consistently recommend stylistic improvements to make the Uyghur text more natural, fluent, and contemporary. The current formal and somewhat archaic phrasing should be simplified and rendered in a more conversational and idiomatic Uyghur style to enhance readability and engagement without compromising doctrinal accuracy. Phrases such as "بۇ بولسا، بىزنىڭ ئاتا-بوبالىرىمىز ئىبراھىم ۋە ئۇنىڭ ئەۋلادلىرى ئۈچۈن ئۈلگۈسىز بەرگەن مۇقىم ۋەدەگە لايىق ئەمەلدۇر" are specifically identified for simplification to improve smoothness and natural flow. The overall goal is to preserve the theological content and reverence while adopting a style that resonates with modern Uyghur readers. No additions or removals of doctrinal content are suggested; the focus is solely on modernizing and naturalizing the language for contemporary use.

However, peer reviewers consistently recommend improving the translation's style to be more natural, fluent, and contemporary in Uyghur.

The translation of Luke 1:54-55 is accurate and theologically faithful from a conservative Christian viewpoint, effectively conveying God's mercy to Israel and His covenant with Abraham and his descendants. However, peer reviewers unanimously recommend stylistic improvements to enhance naturalness and readability in contemporary Uyghur. Specifically, the translation should simplify sentence structures, reduce verbosity, and replace formal, literal, or archaic expressions with more conversational and idiomatic language. Phrases such as "ئەسلەپ قالدى" and "بۇ ۋەدە بىزنىڭ ئاتا-بوبالىرىمىز" are examples to be rendered more fluidly and naturally. These changes aim to improve flow and engagement without altering doctrinal accuracy or reverence. No content additions or theological changes are needed; the focus is solely on adopting a modern, accessible Uyghur style that resonates with today's readers while maintaining faithfulness to the original message.

Working on verse LUK 1:54-55 which has grade 78.16666666666667

The peer review of Luke 1:54-55 highlights that while the translation faithfully conveys the conservative Christian theological message, it suffers from overly formal, archaic, and somewhat awkward phrasing that reduces readability and naturalness for contemporary Uyghur audiences. To improve, the translation should adopt a more conversational, fluent, and idiomatic style with simplified sentence structures and smoother flow, enhancing engagement without altering doctrinal accuracy. A critical correction is the mistranslation of "Abraham" as "Abdullah," which must be corrected to maintain theological fidelity. Additionally, unclear or non-literal phrases such as "this established promise was sent" should be revised to align more closely with the Greek original, accurately reflecting God's promise to the fathers and Abraham's descendants forever. These revisions should modernize the language, improve clarity and naturalness, and preserve the conservative Christian theological emphasis without adding or removing doctrinal content.

Working on verse LUK 1:63 which has grade 89.33333333333333

The translation of Luke 1:63 is generally accurate and faithful to the Greek source, maintaining the conservative Christian interpretation and theological correctness. However, multiple reviewers note that the phrase translating "requested a piece of wax tablet" ("بىر پارچە موم تاختاينى ئەكىلىشنى تەلەپ قىلىپ") feels somewhat formal, stiff, or archaic for contemporary Uyghur readers. A more natural, modern, and conversational expression for requesting the writing tablet is recommended to improve readability and flow without losing meaning. Similarly, while the phrase "ئۇنىڭ ئىسمى يەھيادۇر" correctly conveys the name 'John' conservatively, it may sound formal and less natural in modern usage; alternatives like "ئۇنىڭ ئىسمى يەھيا دەپ قويۇلدى" or "ئۇنىڭ ئىسمى يەھيا دېلدى" could be considered for better naturalness. The wording for writing "دەپ يازدى" might be replaced with "يېزدى" to sound more natural. The expression conveying everyone's amazement, "ھەممەيلەن ئىنتايىن ھەيران قېلىشتى", is appropriate but could be made slightly more colloquial or natural to enhance fluidity. Overall, to improve the translation, minor stylistic adjustments focusing on contemporary and natural language are suggested, while preserving conservative theological clarity and faithfulness to the original text.

The translation of Luke 1:68 is theologically accurate and aligns with conservative Christian doctrine, correctly praising the Lord God of Israel for visiting and redeeming His people. However, to enhance readability and clarity for modern Uyghur readers, it is recommended to revise the phrase "ئۇلارغا خۇدالىق ئەتىدى" which currently risks implying deification. Instead, use wording that clearly conveys God's redemption, deliverance, or sovereign action. Also, update formal or traditional expressions such as "پەرۋەردىگارغا تەشەككۈر-مەدھىيە بولسۇن" to a more natural, conversational style while maintaining reverence and doctrinal soundness. These adjustments will improve the natural flow and comprehension of the verse without sacrificing theological precision or faithfulness to the original Greek text.

Working on verse LUK 1:5 which has grade 89.5

The translation accurately and faithfully conveys Luke 1:5's original Greek meaning and conservatively Christian theological details, including proper names, historical context, and lineage references. However, it leans somewhat towards a formal or slightly archaic style in Uyghur, which can hinder natural readability and flow. To improve, rephrase certain expressions and sentence structures to be more contemporary, fluid, and natural in modern Uyghur while preserving accuracy, clarity, and reverence. This will enhance accessibility and maintain doctrinal fidelity.

Working on verse LUK 1:5 which has grade 89.5

The translation of Luke 1:5 is accurate and conservatively faithful to the original Greek text and theological context, correctly rendering names, roles, and lineage. However, the phrasing currently uses a formal and somewhat archaic style that can be improved for contemporary Uyghur readers. To enhance readability and flow, the translation should incorporate more natural, colloquial expressions and smoother sentence structures. These stylistic refinements should preserve doctrinal fidelity, clarity, and reverence for the sacred text. Avoid altering factual content or theological references, and focus solely on improving fluency and accessibility for modern audiences while maintaining respectfulness.

Working on verse LUK 1:5 which has grade 89.5

The translation of Luke 1:5 faithfully and accurately conveys the original Greek text and conservative Christian theology, properly rendering names, historical context, and lineage. However, the language tends to be formal and slightly archaic. To improve, the translation should adopt a more contemporary and conversational Uyghur style by softening or simplifying certain phrases such as "تۈركۈمىگە تەۋە" and time expressions like "ھېرود پادىشاھ بولغان دەۋردە." These stylistic refinements will enhance natural flow, readability, and accessibility for modern Uyghur readers while preserving doctrinal fidelity, clarity, and reverence. Avoid changing any theological content or adding information; focus solely on making the expression more fluid and natural.

Working on verse LUK 1:5 which has grade 87.16666666666667

The translation of Luke 1:5 faithfully and accurately conveys the original Greek and conservative Christian theology, properly rendering names, historical context, and lineage. However, multiple reviewers note the style is somewhat formal, literal, and archaic, which reduces readability and natural flow in modern Uyghur. To address this, the translation should employ more contemporary, conversational, and fluid phrasing—particularly simplifying terms like 'كاھىنلار تۈركۈمىدىن' and 'ئابىيا ناملىق كاھىنلار تۈركۈمىدىن'—while maintaining theological accuracy and reverence. No theological or factual changes should be made. This stylistic modernization will enhance accessibility and engagement for modern Uyghur readers without compromising doctrinal fidelity.

Working on verse LUK 1:37 which has grade 89.66666666666667

The current translation of Luke 1:37 into Uyghur is accurate and doctrinally sound, effectively expressing God's omnipotence as understood in conservative Christianity. However, the phrasing 'چۈنكى خۇدا بىلەن ھېچ نەرسە ئىمكىن بولمايدۇ' is somewhat formal and potentially ambiguous in contemporary Uyghur. To improve naturalness and clarity, it is recommended to rephrase the verse to emphasize God's power more directly and colloquially, for example, using 'چۈنكى خۇدا ئۈچۈن ھېچ نەرسە ئىمكىن ئەمەس' ('For God, nothing is impossible'). Additionally, avoid including unnecessary speech markers like '، ــ دېدى' unless explicitly required by context. Implementing these changes will enhance readability and fluency while maintaining faithful and conservative Christian theological integrity.

Working on verse LUK 1:69-71 which has grade 89.66666666666667

The translation of Luke 1:69-71 is theologically accurate and faithfully conveys the conservative Christian meaning of God's promise of salvation through the Davidic lineage, using appropriate biblical imagery like 'horn of salvation.' However, multiple reviewers noted that while the translation is doctrinally sound, the language sometimes feels formal, slightly archaic, or heavy, which detracts from achieving a fully natural and contemporary Uyghur style. To improve, it is recommended to rephrase certain expressions—such as "قۇلى بولغان داۋۇتنىڭ جەمەتى ئىچىدىن" and "بىز ئۈچۈن بىر نىجات مۈڭگۈزىنى ئۆستۈرۈپ تۇرغۇزدى"—to more conversational, idiomatic equivalents without losing theological precision or reverence. Minor punctuation corrections may also enhance readability. Overall, the translation balances faithfulness and accessibility well but would benefit from stylistic smoothing to better fit modern Uyghur usage while maintaining doctrinal correctness.

Working on verse LUK 1:69-71 which has grade 84.5

The peer reviews affirm that the translation of Luke 1:69-71 faithfully conveys conservative Christian theology and accurately reflects the original Greek text, emphasizing salvation through the house of David and the fulfillment of prophecy. However, the translation style is consistently noted as formal, dense, and somewhat heavy, reducing naturalness and readability in contemporary Uyghur. Reviewers recommend simplifying and smoothing the language to a more conversational and idiomatic style, avoiding cumbersome or overly long expressions, and removing interpretive expansions beyond the Greek text to improve clarity and flow. Maintaining doctrinal accuracy and reverence is essential, but the translation should adopt a more natural and accessible style to meet modern readers' expectations. These actionable corrections include revising phrases such as "raised a strong horn" and complex explanations into simpler, more fluid Uyghur, and ensuring sentence structures are concise and easy to follow. Overall, the translation should balance faithfulness with a contemporary style without losing theological precision.

The translation of Luke 1:58 is accurate and faithful to the original Greek, conveying the Lord's great mercy and the joy of Elizabeth's neighbors and relatives with appropriate conservative Christian interpretation. All reviewers agree the current wording is clear and the key theological nuances are preserved. However, the translation style is somewhat formal and slightly indirect, which may impact naturalness and fluidity in modern Uyghur.

Specifically, it is advised to replace formal or slightly dated expressions such as "قوشنىلىرى ۋە ياقىندا تەۋەلىكىدىكىلىرى" with more natural alternatives like "ئەتىراپتىكىلەر ۋە تۇغقانلىرى." Similarly, phrasing describing "the Lord's great mercy" should be streamlined for clarity and naturalness without losing theological depth. These refinements will improve readability and reader engagement without compromising doctrinal fidelity. No additions or changes to theological content are needed, ensuring the translation remains conservative and faithful to the biblical text.

The peer reviews confirm that the translation of Luke 1:58 accurately and faithfully conveys the original Greek text and aligns with conservative Christian theology, emphasizing God's great mercy and the communal rejoicing. However, the main area for improvement is stylistic: the translation's language is somewhat formal and slightly indirect for modern Uyghur speakers. To enhance readability and naturalness, it is recommended to simplify and streamline phrases such as "پەرۋەردىگارنىڭ ئۇنىڭغا كۆرسەتكەن چوڭ رەھمىتىنى ئاڭلاپ" by using more contemporary, fluid expressions without losing theological depth or reverence. Similarly, expressions like "ئۇنىڭ بىلەن خۇشال بولدى" could be revised to sound more natural and relatable in everyday language. Overall, no theological content changes are needed; the focus should be on minor stylistic refinements that improve flow and clarity while preserving doctrinal fidelity and a conservative Christian viewpoint.

The peer reviews confirm that Luke 1:58's translation accurately reflects the original Greek and preserves conservative Christian theology, particularly God's great mercy and communal joy. The main actionable corrections are to improve naturalness and fluency in modern Uyghur. Specifically, replace the phrase 'چىڭ رەھمەت' with a more natural alternative like 'چوڭ رەھمەت' to better express 'great mercy.' Also, revise 'خوشاللىقىنى بىلدى' to a more contemporary and natural expression of shared joy, such as 'ئۇنىڭغا بىللە خوشال بولدى.' These changes enhance readability and accessibility without altering theological content or introducing new material. Maintaining doctrinal fidelity remains essential.

Working on verse LUK 1:2 which has grade 90.0

The translation of Luke 1:2 is generally faithful to the original Greek text and successfully preserves the conservative Christian interpretation emphasizing eyewitnesses and servants of the word. It effectively conveys the theological meaning with clarity and maintains doctrinal integrity. However, some reviewers noted that the phrasing tends to be somewhat formal, archaic, or parenthetical (use of parentheses), which can disrupt the natural flow and reduce contemporary readability for modern Uyghur readers. To enhance the translation, it is recommended to refine the wording by simplifying or restructuring phrases, removing parentheses where possible, and adopting a more fluid and natural modern style. This will improve readability and accessibility while preserving the faithful and conservative theological message. Overall, the translation is strong but would benefit from minor stylistic adjustments to better meet the project objective of creating a clear, natural, and doctrinally sound Bible translation in modern Uyghur.

The translation of Luke 1:2 is theologically faithful and preserves the conservative Christian understanding of eyewitness testimony and the transmission of the Word. However, it currently leans toward a formal and somewhat archaic style, using phrases such as "باشتىن-ئاخىر" that may disrupt natural flow for modern Uyghur readers. To improve readability and accessibility, it is recommended to revise the wording to be more conversational, fluid, and contemporary in style—simplifying and restructuring phrases where appropriate. These adjustments should enhance naturalness and ease of reading without compromising doctrinal integrity or the reverence due to the biblical message. No changes to content or theological emphasis are necessary, only minor stylistic modernization.

The translation of Luke 1:2 accurately conveys the original Greek text and preserves the conservative Christian emphasis on eyewitnesses and servants of the word, maintaining theological faithfulness and reverence. However, multiple reviewers suggest enhancing the style by adopting a more contemporary, fluid, and natural Uyghur phrasing to improve readability and engagement for modern readers. This includes softening formal or archaic expressions and avoiding overly formal terms like 'بۇ بايانلار' and 'تەرەپىدىن بىزگە يەتكۈزۈلگەن' in favor of conversational alternatives.

The current translation of Luke 1:2 accurately and faithfully conveys the original Greek meaning and maintains conservative Christian theological emphasis on eyewitnesses and servants of the word. Reviewers agree the wording is clear, respectful, and understandable for modern Uyghur readers. However, the style leans slightly formal and occasionally archaic, with phrases like "بۇ ھەقىقەتلەر" and "سۆزلەنگەن" feeling somewhat stiff or less natural. To enhance readability and natural flow, it is recommended to make minor stylistic adjustments that adopt a more contemporary and conversational Uyghur expression while preserving the doctrinal accuracy and reverence. No content additions or theological changes are needed. Avoiding overly formal or parenthetical structures and smoothing phrasing will improve the translation’s accessibility and engagement for modern audiences.

The peer reviews affirm that the translation of Luke 1:16 accurately conveys the conservative Christian meaning and is faithful to the Greek original. It clearly expresses John the Baptist's role in turning many Israelites back to their God. The translation is generally clear, natural, and suitable for a contemporary Uyghur audience. However, reviewers suggest that the phrase "پەرۋەردىگار خۇداسى" (the Lord God) is somewhat formal and literal, which may affect readability and stylistic flow. They recommend considering a more natural, fluid, or simpler expression for this phrase to enhance contemporary style and ease of reading, while maintaining reverence and doctrinal fidelity. Overall, the translation balances accuracy and clarity well but could benefit from slight stylistic refinement to improve modern Uyghur readability.

The peer reviews commend the translation for accurately and faithfully conveying the Greek text's meaning and the conservative Christian theological message, especially emphasizing the Lord's hand being with the child. The primary correction advised is to improve the phrase 'ئۇلارنى كۆڭلىگە پۈكۈپ,' which is deemed somewhat idiomatic and less natural in modern Uyghur. Reviewers recommend replacing this phrase with a more fluid and contemporary expression to better reflect the idea of 'pondering in their hearts,' thereby enhancing readability and naturalness without sacrificing theological accuracy. Apart from this, the translation is regarded as clear, natural, and stylistically appropriate for the target audience. Implementing this stylistic refinement will strengthen the translation's fluency while maintaining doctrinal fidelity.
