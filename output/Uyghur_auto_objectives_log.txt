The translation of Luke 1:9 requires significant revision to better align with the original Greek text and conservative Christian theology. Specifically, remove any added or inaccurate phrases implying restrictions or prohibitions, such as "چەك تاشلىغاندا" (casting restrictions), which are not present in the Greek and confuse the meaning. Clarify that Zacharias was "chosen by lot according to the custom of the priesthood" to enter the Lord's temple and offer incense, rendering "ἔλαχε" precisely and concisely without unnecessary additions. Use culturally and theologically appropriate and standardized terminology for "temple of the Lord," preferably "رەبنىڭ مەبەدى" or "ئىبادەتخانا," to reflect the sacred setting clearly. Simplify and restructure the sentence for naturalness and readability in modern Uyghur, avoiding convoluted or informal expressions such as "شۇنداق بولدى" that disrupt flow and clarity. A recommended phrasing would be: "كاھىنلارنىڭ ئادىتى بويىچە، ئۇ رەبنىڭ مەبەدىگە كىرىپ خۇشبۇي سېلىشقا تاللانغان." This maintains fidelity, theological accuracy, clarity, and readability, meeting the standards of conservative Christian biblical translation.
