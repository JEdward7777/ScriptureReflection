Working on verse LUK 1:9 which has grade 85.0

The peer review comments collectively identify that the translation of LUK 1:9 faithfully reflects the Greek original and maintains a conservative Christian perspective. However, the phrase "چەك تاشلىغاندا شۇنداق بولدىكى، چەك ئۇنىڭغا چىقتى" intended to express the priest being chosen by casting lots is awkward, unclear, and somewhat archaic or ambiguous in contemporary Uyghur. It should be revised to a clearer, more natural expression that accurately conveys the concept without confusion or unnecessary literalism. Additionally, while "مۇقەددەس جاي" effectively translates "temple of the Lord," considering a slightly more natural or common phrase like "رەبنىڭ مەسچىتى" could enhance readability without compromising theological accuracy. Overall, the translation should maintain its faithfulness and doctrinal integrity while adopting smoother, modern Uyghur phrasing to improve clarity and flow for contemporary readers.
