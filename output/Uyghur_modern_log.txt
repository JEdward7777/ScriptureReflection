Working on verse LUK 1:42 which has grade 0.0

The primary correction needed is to provide a complete translation for Luke 1:42, which is currently missing. This verse is crucial because it contains Elizabeth's blessing on Mary and her unborn child, reflecting key conservative Christian theology. The translation should be clear, natural, and contemporary Uyghur, maintaining reverence and doctrinal accuracy. Without this translation, evaluation and grading cannot be performed, resulting in a failing assessment for this verse. The student is strongly encouraged to supply a faithful, readable, and theologically consistent translation of Luke 1:42 to meet the project's standards and enable proper evaluation.

Working on verse LUK 1:9 which has grade 72.5

The translation of Luke 1:9 is theologically sound and accurately reflects the conservative Christian interpretation, particularly regarding the priestly duty of burning incense in the temple. However, the current phrasing is awkward, unclear, and somewhat archaic, reducing naturalness and readability in contemporary Uyghur. Key phrases such as those describing the assignment by lot ('چەك تاشلىغاندا شۇنداق بولدىكى، چەك ئۇنىڭغا چىقتى') are confusing and do not clearly convey that Zechariah was chosen by lot for this sacred duty. Additionally, sentence structures are convoluted, and some terminology, while accurate, could be made more conversational without losing reverence. It is recommended to simplify and clarify the sentence, use more straightforward expressions, and improve fluidity to create a natural, readable, and doctrinally faithful translation suited for modern readers.

Working on verse LUK 1:42 which has grade 74.16666666666667

The primary correction for Luke 1:42 is to refine the existing translation to enhance naturalness, fluency, and contemporary style in Uyghur, while fully maintaining the conservative Christian theological meaning. The current phrase "ئۇ بويىدىن ئۆتكەن مېۋەگە ۋە ئاياللار ئىچىدە سەن بەختلىك بولدۇڭ، دەيدى" is faithful but awkward and somewhat literal, lacking clear separation of the blessings on Mary and on the fruit of her womb. The translation should be restructured and reworded to improve readability and flow, using more common and fluid Uyghur expressions for "blessed" and "fruit of your womb." This will ensure the verse is impactful, clear, reverent, and stylistically elegant for modern readers. There is no need to add or remove content beyond this stylistic enhancement.

Working on verse LUK 1:68 which has grade 83.0

The peer review affirms that the translation accurately conveys the core theological meaning of Luke 1:68 from a conservative Christian perspective, including God's blessing, visitation, and redemption of His people. However, multiple reviewers noted that the phrasing 'يوقلاپ، ئۇلاردىن خەۋەر ئېلىپ' feels awkward, somewhat literal, and less natural in contemporary Uyghur. Suggested improvements include replacing 'يوقلاپ' with more fluid terms like 'زارەت قىلغان' (visited), 'يېقىنلاشقان' (approached), or 'زىيارەت قىلدى' (visited), and simplifying or modernizing the phrase to enhance readability and flow. Additionally, the phrase 'بەدەل تۆلەپ ئۇلارنى ھۆر قىلدى' (paid a price and freed them) correctly reflects redemption but could be refined for smoother, more natural expression in Uyghur. Reviewers recommend aiming for a more contemporary, idiomatic, and fluent style without compromising doctrinal accuracy or reverence. Implementing these stylistic refinements will improve the translation's naturalness, clarity, and engagement while faithfully maintaining conservative Christian theological content.

The peer reviews commend the student's faithful and theologically accurate translation of Luke 1:17, maintaining core conservative Christian concepts such as the spirit and power of Elijah and the mission to prepare God's people. However, all reviewers note that the current translation is somewhat formal, lengthy, and complex, affecting natural readability in modern Uigara. Actionable corrections include: 1) Simplify and shorten sentences for smoother, more conversational flow; 2) Replace formal or cumbersome phrases with more contemporary and natural expressions; 3) Improve sentence structure and punctuation to enhance readability; 4) Avoid awkward or unnecessary phrases such as '— he said' at the end of the verse; and 5) Ensure the translation balances theological fidelity with a natural, accessible style suitable for contemporary Uigara speakers. Implementing these changes will improve the translation's clarity, fluency, and engagement without compromising doctrinal integrity.

Working on verse LUK 1:9 which has grade 84.0

The translation of Luke 1:9 accurately reflects conservative Christian theology and the original Greek meaning, particularly regarding the priestly duty of burning incense. However, to enhance readability and naturalness in modern Uyghur, the following actions are recommended: simplify and modernize the phrase "كاھىنلىق دۇتالىرى ئارىسىدا ئەڭ ئەڭ چوڭ خادىم ھېسابلانغان شەرت بويىچە" to reduce heaviness and improve fluidity; replace the somewhat archaic or unclear phrase "تاختا چەكمەك بىلەن ئالدى" with a clearer, more familiar contemporary expression that effectively conveys "being chosen by lot" or "offering incense"; maintain all theological content faithfully, ensuring the translation remains doctrinally sound from a conservative Christian viewpoint; avoid overly literal or convoluted sentence structures to make the verse more accessible and natural for modern readers; no addition or removal of content is necessary, only stylistic refinement to improve clarity and flow.

The translation of Luke 1:2 successfully preserves the conservative Christian emphasis on eyewitnesses and faithful transmission, maintaining theological accuracy. However, all peer reviews consistently note that the current phrasing is somewhat formal, literal, and cumbersome, lacking a natural, contemporary, and fluid style suited for modern Uyghur readers. To enhance readability and engagement, the translation should adopt a more conversational tone, simplify complex or lengthy phrases, and smooth the flow while preserving the original message. Parentheses can be used judiciously to aid clarity but should not impede naturalness. Implementing these stylistic improvements will make the translation more accessible without compromising doctrinal integrity.

Working on verse LUK 1:12 which has grade 84.66666666666667

The translation of Luke 1:12 accurately conveys the original Greek text and maintains conservative Christian theological accuracy. However, the phrase 'ھودۇقۇپ قورقۇنچقا چۆمۈپ كەتتى' used to describe Zacharias' fear and agitation is considered somewhat archaic, formal, or poetic by multiple reviewers. To enhance readability and meet the objective of a natural, contemporary style for Uigara readers, it is recommended to revise this phrasing to a more modern and fluid expression that retains the vividness and theological fidelity of the passage. Slight stylistic refinement will improve the natural flow and accessibility without altering the core meaning or doctrinal integrity.

Working on verse LUK 1:19 which has grade 85.0

The translation of Luke 1:19 is accurate, faithful to the original Greek, and maintains conservative Christian theological integrity by clearly identifying the angel Gabriel and his divine mission. However, the style is generally formal and somewhat archaic, which reduces its naturalness and contemporary readability in modern Uigara. To improve, the translation should adopt a more conversational and fluid phrasing, especially for expressions like "مەن ئەۋەتىلدىم" (I was sent) and "ساڭا سۆز قىلىشقا، بۇ خۇش خەۋەرنى ساڭا يەتكۈزۈشكە" (to speak to you and bring you this good news). Streamlining sentence structure and choosing clearer, more direct expressions will enhance readability and engagement while preserving theological accuracy. Overall, the translation is solid doctrinally but would benefit from stylistic revisions to achieve a more natural and modern tone consistent with the project's objectives.

Working on verse LUK 1:21 which has grade 85.33333333333333

The translation of Luke 1:21 accurately conveys the original Greek text and maintains a conservative Christian perspective. However, the phrase 'بۇنچىۋالا ھايال بولدى' feels somewhat awkward, formal, or unnatural in modern Uyghur. To enhance readability and better suit contemporary Uyghur speakers, it is recommended to replace this phrase with a smoother, more natural, and conversational expression. These stylistic refinements should preserve the original meaning and reverence while improving flow and accessibility for modern readers.

Working on verse LUK 1:4 which has grade 85.5

The translation of Luke 1:4 is theologically accurate and aligns well with conservative Christian doctrine, clearly emphasizing assurance in the teachings received. However, the style is consistently noted as formal, traditional, and somewhat stiff, which impacts the naturalness and modern readability of the text. To improve, it is recommended to soften and modernize the phrasing to create a more conversational and fluid expression without compromising doctrinal fidelity or reverence. This could involve simplifying sentence structure and using more approachable language to better meet the objective of a contemporary and natural translation style.

The translation of Luke 1:1 accurately preserves the conservative Christian understanding and remains faithful to the original Greek text. However, the phrasing is often noted as somewhat formal, cumbersome, and less natural or fluid for a modern Uigara-speaking audience. To improve, the translation should simplify sentence structures and use more conversational, contemporary wording to enhance readability and natural flow. Avoiding overly literal or formal expressions will better resonate with modern readers while maintaining doctrinal accuracy. Overall, the translation meets theological and accuracy goals but requires refinement toward a smoother, more natural style to fully achieve the objectives.

Working on verse LUK 1:1 which has grade 83.66666666666667

The translation of Luke 1:1 effectively conveys the conservative Christian message and maintains theological accuracy. However, the phrase "ئارتۇقچە ئىشەنچلىك دەپ قارالغان نۇرغۇن كىشىلەر" is overly formal, somewhat awkward, and may misrepresent the original Greek by implying a judgment on trustworthiness rather than describing many who undertook to compile narratives. To improve, rephrase this section to more directly and simply express that many people undertook to gather and write the accounts of fulfilled events. The overall sentence should be restructured into clearer, more natural, and conversational language suitable for contemporary Uyghur readers to enhance readability and flow. These refinements will preserve the conservative viewpoint while making the translation more accessible and fluid.

Working on verse LUK 1:78-79 which has grade 86.0

The peer review comments agree that the current translation of LUK 1:78-79 accurately reflects the conservative Christian theological meaning, emphasizing God's mercy, the coming of light to those in darkness, and guidance to the path of peace. However, multiple reviewers suggest that the translation's style is somewhat formal, poetic, and occasionally archaic, which reduces naturalness and contemporary readability. The phrase 'ئەرشتىن تاڭ شەپىقى' ('dawn from on high') is repeatedly identified as poetic and slightly heavy; a more straightforward, conversational phrasing is recommended to improve flow and engagement for modern Uyghur readers. Additionally, expressions like 'خۇدايىمىزنىڭ ئىچى-باغرىدىن ئۇرغۇپ چىققان شەپقەتلەر' and 'پۇتلىرىمىزنى ئامانلىق يولىغا باشلاش' are appropriate but might benefit from simplification for naturalness without losing theological depth. Sentence structures can be complex, so smoothing and simplifying them would enhance readability. Overall, the translation should maintain its theological integrity while adopting a more natural, modern, and accessible style.

The translation of Luke 1:25 faithfully preserves the conservative Christian theological meaning, emphasizing God's gracious intervention in removing Elizabeth's disgrace. However, several reviewers note that certain phrases such as 'پەرۋەردىگار مېنىڭ ھالىمغا نەزىرىنى چۈشۈرۈپ,' 'نومۇسقا قېلىشتىن خالاس قىلىپ,' and 'ماڭا بۇ كۈنلەردە شۇنچىلىك شاپائەت كۆرسەتتى' are somewhat formal, archaic, or less natural in contemporary Uyghur. To enhance readability and better resonate with modern Uyghur readers, it is recommended to simplify and rephrase these expressions into more natural, fluid, and modern language without compromising doctrinal fidelity. Implementing these stylistic improvements will increase accessibility and fluency while maintaining the reverence and theological depth appropriate for Scripture.

The peer reviews confirm that the current translation faithfully conveys Luke 1:63 with conservative Christian accuracy, particularly in naming John (Yəhya). To enhance naturalness and contemporary readability in Uyghur, it is recommended to replace the formal "يەھيادۇر" with the more familiar "يەھيا" as used previously. The term for "tablet" should be simplified from the somewhat archaic "موم تاختاينى" to a more natural and modern expression such as "تاختا" or "يېزىش تاختىسى". Additionally, revising formal phrases to a more conversational style will improve the text's fluidity and accessibility. Implementing these changes will maintain theological fidelity while ensuring the translation reads smoothly and naturally for modern Uyghur readers.

The translation accurately conveys the conservative Christian meaning of Luke 1:16, stating that John will turn many of the sons of Israel back to the Lord their God. However, to better meet the objective of a modern and natural Uigara Bible translation, the phrasing should be revised for greater fluidity and contemporary style. Specifically, the phrase "پەرۋەردىگار خۇداسىنىڭ يېنىغا قايتۇرىدۇ" is somewhat formal and literal; rephrasing it into a more colloquial and natural expression would enhance readability while maintaining doctrinal integrity and reverence appropriate to the sacred text. Overall, the translation is theologically sound but would benefit from stylistic refinement to improve its accessibility and flow for today's readers.

Working on verse LUK 1:58 which has grade 86.66666666666667

The translation of Luke 1:58 accurately reflects the original Greek and conservative Christian interpretation by emphasizing God's great mercy and the shared joy of Elizabeth's neighbors and relatives. To enhance the translation, it is recommended to replace archaic or formal terms like "قولۇم-قوشنىلىرى" with more common modern equivalents for "neighbors," simplify and rephrase cumbersome phrases such as "شۇنچە ئۇلغايتقانلىقىنى" to express God's mercy in a more straightforward and conversational way, and consider breaking longer sentences into shorter, clearer ones. These adjustments will make the translation more natural, contemporary, and accessible in Uyghur while maintaining theological accuracy and reverence.

Working on verse LUK 1:6 which has grade 86.83333333333333

The translation of Luke 1:6 accurately conveys the conservative Christian doctrinal meaning, emphasizing the righteousness and blameless obedience of Zechariah and Elizabeth before God. However, multiple reviewers suggest that the language is somewhat formal and includes archaic or heavy phrases that may hinder natural readability in contemporary Uigara. To improve, the translation should simplify and modernize expressions such as 'پەرۋەردىگارنىڭ پۈتۈن ئەمر-بەلگىلىمىلىرى بويىچە ئەيىبسىز ماڭاتتى' to more fluid, conversational equivalents without losing theological accuracy or reverence. Streamlining sentence structure and using everyday, current expressions will enhance clarity and accessibility while faithfully preserving the conservative Christian message.

Working on verse LUK 1:6 which has grade 86.0

The translation of Luke 1:6 is theologically accurate and maintains a conservative Christian perspective by emphasizing righteousness before God and obedience to His commandments. However, the phrase 'ھەقسىز بويۇن ئېگىدىغان' is somewhat unnatural and can be confusing in contemporary Uyghur, as 'ھەقسىز' usually means 'free' or 'without charge.' Reviewers recommend replacing this phrase with more natural and clear alternatives such as 'گۈنەھسىز بويۇن ئېگىدىغان,' 'ئامانەت بىلەن بويۇن ئېگىدىغان,' or 'پۈتكۈل بويۇن ئېگىدىغان' to better express 'blameless obedience' or 'faithful submission.' Additionally, simplifying and modernizing the expression for obedience will enhance readability and accessibility while preserving doctrinal accuracy. The remainder of the translation, including the statement of righteousness before God, is sound and should be retained.

The translation of Luke 1:9 faithfully conveys the conservative Christian theological perspective and the original Greek meaning, accurately portraying Zacharias's priestly duty to burn incense in the Lord's temple according to the established priestly order. However, to enhance clarity, naturalness, and accessibility for modern Uyghur readers, it is recommended to refine the style by simplifying and modernizing formal phrases such as 'كاھىنلار نۆۋەت تەرتىپى بويىچە' and 'بېكىتتى'. More conversational, fluent expressions like 'ۋەزىپىسىنى ئالدى' or 'ۋەزىپىسىگە بېرىلدى' can be used to replace more formal terms, improving readability without compromising theological integrity. The translation should maintain its doctrinal soundness and avoid archaic or heavy constructions, ensuring it remains clear, faithful, and engaging for contemporary audiences. No content addition or removal is necessary, only stylistic improvement to meet the objective fully.

The translation of Luke 1:2 is doctrinally sound and faithful to the conservative Christian perspective, accurately emphasizing eyewitness testimony and faithful transmission. Peer reviews unanimously recommend enhancing the translation's style by making it more contemporary, natural, and fluid in Uyghur, reducing formality and literalness to improve readability and engagement for modern readers. Specifically, formal phrases such as "based on the most accurate accounts" should be rephrased into more conversational language without losing theological meaning. These stylistic adjustments will maintain theological accuracy and clarity while making the text more accessible and natural in the target language.

Working on verse LUK 1:72-75 which has grade 87.66666666666667

The translation faithfully conveys conservative Christian theology, accurately reflecting God's mercy, His holy covenant, the oath to Abraham, and deliverance from enemies, aligning well with doctrinal expectations. However, the style is often formal, traditional, and somewhat complex, with lengthy sentences and certain phrases that feel heavy or archaic for contemporary Uyghur readers. To improve, the translation should employ simpler, more conversational language and rephrase specific expressions like 'ئىلتىپات ئەيلەپ', 'قەسىمىنى ئېسىدە تۇتۇپ', and 'ئەمەلگە ئاشۇرۇش' to sound more natural and fluid. Breaking up longer sentences can also enhance readability. These adjustments will preserve theological accuracy and reverence while achieving a more modern, natural, and engaging Uyghur Bible translation suitable for today’s audience.

The peer review comments collectively recommend refining the translation of Luke 1:72-75 to enhance naturalness and readability for contemporary Uyghur readers while preserving conservative Christian doctrinal accuracy. Specifically, they advise rephrasing awkward or heavy expressions such as 'ھېچبىر تەۋەككۈل قىلماي خىزمەت قىلايلى' to more fluent and conversational alternatives. Simplifying lengthy sentences and smoothing formal or archaic phrases will improve flow and engagement. Maintaining key theological terms and the passage's reverential tone is essential, but a more modern and accessible style is encouraged. Implementing these adjustments will balance faithfulness to the original Greek and conservative theology with a natural, modern Uyghur expression, thus fulfilling the translation's objectives effectively.

The translation of Luke 1:35 accurately expresses the core conservative Christian doctrines, including the role of the Holy Spirit, the virgin birth, and Jesus' divine sonship. The vocabulary and meaning are faithful to the original Greek text, maintaining theological correctness and reverence. However, reviewers recommend revising the translation style to be less formal and heavy, aiming for a smoother, more natural, and conversational flow suited to contemporary Uyghur readers. Specifically, phrases like 'the power of the Most High overshadowing you' should be softened or rephrased for better readability. Overall, minor stylistic adjustments can improve the translation's accessibility while preserving doctrinal integrity.

Working on verse LUK 1:59 which has grade 88.0

The peer reviews agree that the translation accurately conveys Luke 1:59 with conservative Christian theological fidelity, correctly including key elements such as circumcision on the eighth day and naming the child after Zechariah. However, all reviewers note the style is somewhat formal, old-fashioned, or slightly stilted for contemporary Uyghur readers. To improve, it is recommended to modernize and simplify phrasing for better naturalness and readability. Specific phrases to consider revising include "بوۋاق تۇغۇلۇپ سەككىز كۈن بولغاندا" ("the baby was born and eight days passed") and "خالايىق بالىنىڭ خەتنىسىنى قىلغىلى كەلدى" ("the people came to circumcise the child"), which could be expressed more fluidly. Also, replacing slightly formal expressions like "شۇنداق بولدىكى" with more conversational equivalents is suggested. Overall, the translation should preserve its clear conservative message while adopting a smoother, more contemporary style to better engage modern Uyghur readers.

Working on verse LUK 1:23 which has grade 88.33333333333333

The translation of Luke 1:23 is accurate, clear, and faithfully preserves the conservative Christian interpretation of the original Greek text. It effectively communicates the completion of the temple service and the return home in understandable Uyghur. However, the style tends to be somewhat formal and slightly old-fashioned. To enhance readability and better engage modern Uyghur readers, the translation should adopt a more contemporary, natural, and conversational style. Specifically, consider simplifying or replacing phrases such as 'شۇنداق بولدىكى' and 'ئىبادەتخانىدىكى خىزمەت مۇددىتى توشۇشى' with more fluent, accessible expressions. Also, rephrasing 'ئۆيىگە قايتتى' into a more colloquial form could improve relatability. Overall, maintain doctrinal faithfulness while updating stylistic elements to meet the objective of a modern, readable translation.

Working on verse LUK 1:28 which has grade 88.33333333333333

The peer reviews affirm that the translation of LUK 1:28 accurately and faithfully conveys the original Greek text's conservative Christian meaning, emphasizing Mary's favored status and the Lord's presence. However, several reviewers note that the current phrasing leans toward formality and occasional archaic expressions, such as "ئەي شەپقەتكە مۇيەسسەر بولغان قىز," which reduce the natural and conversational flow desired for contemporary Uyghur readers. Importantly, the explicit phrase "Blessed are you among women" (εὐλογημένη σὺ ἐν γυναιξίν) is missing in the translation, diminishing clarity and completeness. To improve, the translation should: 1) explicitly include the blessing phrase to maintain theological and textual completeness; 2) soften and modernize expressions to enhance readability and naturalness while preserving reverence; 3) avoid overly formal or archaic wording, favoring fluid and conversational language suitable for modern Uyghur audiences. Implementing these corrections will balance doctrinal faithfulness with accessible and engaging style, meeting the translation objectives fully.

The translation of LUK 1:57 accurately and faithfully conveys the original Greek meaning and conservative Christian theological interpretation. However, the phrase "ئېلىزابىتنىڭ تۇغۇتىنىڭ ئاي-كۈنى توشۇپ" is noted as somewhat formal, slightly archaic, and literal. To improve naturalness and readability, it is recommended to revise this phrase into a simpler, more contemporary Uyghur expression that better aligns with modern usage and flows smoothly for current readers. Overall, the translation is good and faithful but could benefit from stylistic modernization to fully meet the translation objective.

The peer reviews confirm that the current Uyghur translation of Luke 1:2 is accurate, doctrinally sound, and maintains a conservative Christian interpretation emphasizing eyewitness testimony and faithful transmission. However, the translation's style is somewhat formal, literal, and cumbersome, which may reduce naturalness and readability for contemporary Uyghur readers. To improve, the translation should be revised to adopt a more conversational, fluid, and natural Uyghur style, smoothing complex or indirect phrases such as "ئۆزىباشقا كۆرۈپ" into modern, concise expressions. These stylistic refinements will enhance readability and engagement while fully preserving theological accuracy and the original message. No changes to content or doctrinal emphasis are necessary; focus solely on naturalizing the language and improving flow for modern readers.

However, all peer reviewers agree that the current style is somewhat formal, literal, and traditional, which can hinder naturalness and readability for contemporary Uyghur readers. To improve the translation, it should adopt a more contemporary and conversational Uyghur style by simplifying complex or formal phrases such as "مۇقىم ساقلاپ قالغۇچىلار ئارقىلىق" and "ئىشەنچلىك رەۋىشتە" into more fluid, natural expressions.

However, the current Uyghur phrasing is formal, literal, and somewhat cumbersome, which reduces naturalness and readability for contemporary readers. To address this, the translation should adopt a more conversational and fluid Uyghur style, simplifying or rephrasing formal or archaic expressions such as "جان بىلەن ھىزمەت قىلغانلار" and "توغرا ۋە ئىنتايىن ئېتىقادلىق ھالدا" into natural, accessible language without losing theological accuracy or reverence.

The peer reviews commend the Luke 1:2 translation for doctrinal faithfulness and clear conveyance of conservative Christian emphasis on eyewitness testimony and faithful transmission. However, they consistently recommend refining the translation's style to be less formal and literal and more contemporary, natural, and conversational in Uyghur. Specifically, formal phrases like "ناھايىتى ئىشىنىچلىك گۇۋاھلار" and "سۆزگە چىن ئىشىنىدىغانلار" should be softened or rephrased to enhance readability and engagement for modern readers. These stylistic improvements should preserve theological accuracy, reverence, and the original message without adding or changing doctrinal content. Past revisions have sought similar refinements, so continued focus on naturalness, fluency, and smoothness of expression is advised to better meet the project's goal of a natural, readable, and doctrinally sound contemporary Uyghur Bible translation.

The peer review comments confirm that the current translation of Luke 1:2 accurately conveys the original Greek meaning and upholds conservative Christian doctrine by emphasizing eyewitnesses and faithful transmission of the Word. However, the style is formal, somewhat literal, and occasionally cumbersome, which reduces naturalness and readability for modern Uyghur audiences. To improve, the translation should adopt a more contemporary, conversational, and fluid Uyghur style, simplifying or rephrasing formal expressions such as 'سۆزگە دىققەت بىلەن ئىشىنىدىغان كىشىلەر' and 'ئەسلەپ قالغان ھالىتىدە ئېتىبار بىلەن يەتكۈزۈلگەن' to enhance natural flow and engagement. Parentheses should be used sparingly and only to aid clarity without disrupting the flow. Importantly, no doctrinal changes, content additions, or shifts in theological emphasis are necessary or recommended. The focus is solely on stylistic refinement to balance readability and faithfulness, meeting the project goal of producing a natural, readable, and doctrinally sound contemporary Uyghur Bible translation.

The peer reviews affirm that the translation of Luke 1:2 faithfully conveys the original Greek meaning and upholds conservative Christian doctrine, emphasizing eyewitness testimony and faithful transmission of the Word. However, the translation's style is overly formal, literal, and somewhat archaic or cumbersome for contemporary Uyghur readers, reducing naturalness and readability. Key phrases such as "سۆزلەرگە دەلىل بولغان" (proof of words) and "خەۋەرلەرگە ھەقىقىي ئىشىنىش بىلەن يېتىپ كەلگەن" (arrived with true belief in the news) are specifically noted as awkward and should be simplified or rephrased. To improve, the translation should adopt a more conversational, fluid, and natural Uyghur style that enhances clarity and engagement while fully preserving theological accuracy and the conservative Christian perspective. No doctrinal content changes or additions are necessary; the focus is solely on stylistic refinement to better suit modern Uyghur readers without compromising the original message or theological integrity.

Working on verse LUK 1:32 which has grade 88.5

The translation of LUK 1:32 is theologically accurate and faithful to conservative Christian doctrine. However, to improve the translation, the phrasing should be made more natural and fluid in modern Uyghur. Specifically, expressions like 'ھەممىدىن ئالىي بولغۇچىنىڭ ئوغلى' ('son of the Most High') and 'ئاتىسى داۋۇتنىڭ تەختىنى ئاتا قىلىدۇ' ('God giving Him the throne of His father David') should be rephrased in a more contemporary, conversational style to enhance readability and flow while preserving doctrinal integrity. Overall, minor stylistic adjustments are recommended to achieve a balance of fidelity, clarity, and naturalness appropriate for today's audience.

The translation of Luke 1:32 is faithful and theologically sound from a conservative Christian perspective. The key corrections recommended are stylistic enhancements to improve the naturalness and contemporary flow in Uyghur. Specifically, rephrase "بەك چوڭ ئادەم بولىدۇ" to a more natural modern expression conveying greatness, and smooth the phrasing "دادىسى داۋۇتنىڭ تەختىنى بەرىدۇ" to better reflect biblical tradition and improve readability—potentially using "the throne of David his father." The goal is to maintain doctrinal accuracy and reverence while achieving a more conversational and fluid style appropriate for today's Uyghur readers. No content additions or theological changes are advised, only refinements for clarity and natural expression.

Working on verse LUK 1:32 which has grade 88.0

The peer review confirms that the current translation of Luke 1:32 is theologically accurate and faithful to conservative Christian doctrine, clearly affirming Jesus' greatness, divine sonship, and inheritance of David's throne. However, the translation's style is somewhat formal, literal, and less natural in contemporary Uyghur. To improve, it is recommended to refine the phrase "بەك ئۇلۇغ ۋە مۇھىم كىشى بولىدۇ" by replacing the generic "مۇھىم" with a term conveying greater majesty or significance, aligning better with the original Greek meaning of 'greatness.' Additionally, the expression "دادىسى داۋۇتنىڭ تەختىنى بېرىدۇ" should be rendered more idiomatically and fluidly, possibly by omitting "دادىسى" (his father) since lineage is implicit, and using a smoother phrase like "داۋۇت تەختى" (the throne of David). These adjustments will enhance readability, flow, and naturalness for modern Uyghur readers while preserving doctrinal accuracy and reverence. No additions or theological changes are advised; only minor stylistic refinements to achieve a balanced, natural, and clear translation appropriate for today's audience.

The peer reviews unanimously confirm that the Luke 1:32 translation is theologically accurate and faithful to conservative Christian doctrine, correctly portraying Jesus as the Son of the Most High and inheritor of David's throne. The main suggested improvement is stylistic: the current wording is somewhat formal and literal, affecting naturalness and contemporary readability in Uyghur. Specific phrases like 'يۇقىرىدەك خۇدانىڭ ئوغلى دەپ ئاتىلىدۇ' and 'خۇدا ئۇنىڭغا داۋۇت تەختىنى بېرىدۇ' are the focus for refinement towards more idiomatic, conversational, and fluid expressions suitable for modern Uyghur readers. No additions or theological changes are advised to avoid repeating previously rejected content. Overall, minor stylistic enhancements are recommended to improve flow, clarity, and accessibility while maintaining doctrinal fidelity and reverence.

The translation accurately conveys the conservative Christian theological content and maintains fidelity to the original Greek text, clearly identifying key characters and doctrines such as the angel Gabriel's mission, Mary's virginity, and Joseph's lineage. However, to enhance readability and align better with modern Uyghur usage, it is recommended to revise certain phrases that currently feel archaic, formal, or poetic. Specifically, expressions like 'پاك بىر قىزنىڭ قېشىغا ئەۋەتىلدى' should be rendered in a more contemporary and natural manner, perhaps replacing 'sent to the bosom of a pure girl' with 'sent to a virgin girl' or a similarly clear phrase. Additionally, simplifying formal phrases such as 'دېيىشىپ قويۇلغانىدى' for 'betrothed to a man' would improve flow and accessibility for modern readers. Implementing these stylistic updates will enhance the naturalness and fluidity of the translation while maintaining its doctrinal accuracy and respectfulness appropriate for scripture.

The translation of Luke 1:26-27 is accurate and doctrinally faithful to conservative Christian theology, effectively conveying key details such as the angel Gabriel's mission, Mary's virginity, and Joseph's Davidic lineage. However, multiple reviewers noted that some phrases like "تاقالغان بىر بايقۇ قىزغا كەلدى" and "داۋۇت جەمەتىدىن بولغان" are somewhat archaic or formal and could be revised to more contemporary, natural, and fluid Uyghur expressions. Suggestions include replacing archaic terms such as "بايقۇ" with more modern alternatives, and rephrasing lineage descriptions to improve readability and flow (e.g., "داۋۇت ئائىلىسىدىن" or "داۋۇت نۇسقىسىدىن كەلگەن"). Overall, the translation would benefit from stylistic updates to enhance accessibility and engagement for modern readers without compromising theological integrity.

The peer review feedback consistently recommends improving the naturalness and contemporary style of the Uyghur translation of Luke 1:26-27 while maintaining conservative Christian theological accuracy. Specifically, archaic and formal phrases like "تاقالغان قىزى" (betrothed virgin), "بايقۇ قىزغا" (virgin girl), and "داۋۇت ئائىلىسىدىن كەلگەن" (from David's household) should be replaced with clearer, more natural modern equivalents. Sentence constructions should be streamlined for better flow and readability to engage modern readers without compromising doctrinal integrity. Previous edits have already ensured theological fidelity, so the actionable corrections are focused on stylistic modernization, enhancing fluency, and using natural contemporary Uyghur vocabulary to describe Mary's virginity, Joseph's lineage, and Gabriel's mission.

The peer review corrections for the Uyghur translation of Luke 1:26-27 recommend retaining all conservative Christian theological elements, including Gabriel's divine mission, Joseph's Davidic lineage, Mary's virginity, and betrothal. However, to enhance readability and naturalness, archaic or formal expressions such as 'ھەقىقىي تۇيغۇسى پۈتكەن بىر قىز' should be replaced with clear, straightforward modern phrases explicitly conveying Mary's virginity. Subjective or unnecessary descriptive language not present in the original Greek text should be removed to maintain simplicity and accuracy. Sentence constructions should be smoothed for a more fluid and conversational style, improving engagement for contemporary readers. These stylistic revisions will preserve doctrinal integrity while meeting the translation objective of clarity, accessibility, and natural Uyghur expression.

The translation of Luke 1:26-27 accurately and faithfully conveys conservative Christian theology, including Gabriel's divine mission, Mary's virginity, and Joseph's Davidic lineage. Peer review suggests stylistic improvements to enhance readability and naturalness in modern Uyghur. Specifically, simplify and shorten lengthy sentences for better flow; replace formal or archaic phrases such as 'تەييارلىق قىلىنغان قىز تۇتقان ئايالى' with clearer, contemporary expressions meaning 'virgin betrothed to Joseph'; avoid subjective or unnecessary descriptive language not present in the original text; and use natural, respectful terminology for Mary and Joseph’s descriptions. These adjustments will maintain doctrinal accuracy while producing a more fluent, accessible, and engaging translation suitable for modern readers.

Working on verse LUK 1:26-27 which has grade 83.83333333333333

The translation of Luke 1:26-27 is theologically accurate and preserves the conservative Christian interpretation, including the identification of Gabriel, Mary's virginity, and Joseph's Davidic lineage. However, the phrasing is formal, somewhat archaic, and occasionally awkward, especially the expression for 'betrothed to a man' (e.g., 'يېڭىدا قىز تۇتقان') and the description of Joseph's lineage ('داۋۇت تۇغقانى بولغان'). To improve the translation, revise these phrases using more natural, contemporary Uyghur expressions that enhance readability and flow without compromising theological accuracy. Remove any subjective or unnecessary descriptive language not found in the original text, and simplify sentence constructions for smoother and more engaging modern Uyghur style. These adjustments will maintain doctrinal fidelity while making the passage clearer and more accessible to modern readers.

The translation of Luke 1:7 accurately and faithfully conveys the conservative Christian theological meaning—Elizabeth's barrenness and the advanced age of both her and Zechariah. However, to improve the translation, it is recommended to replace formal and slightly dated phrases (e.g., 'ئەمما ئېلىزابىت تۇغماس بولغاچقا', 'ئۇنىڭ ئۈستىگە', and 'ئۇلار پەرزەنت كۆرمىگەنىدى') with more natural, conversational, and fluid expressions typical of contemporary Uigara speech. This stylistic refinement will enhance readability and flow without sacrificing doctrinal accuracy, making the text more accessible and engaging to modern readers.

The peer reviews confirm that the current translation of Luke 1:16 accurately conveys the original Greek text and aligns with a conservative Christian interpretation, highlighting John the Baptist's role in turning many Israelites back to the Lord their God. The main recommendation is to revise the phrasing from 'پەرۋەردىگار خۇداغا قايتىشىغا سەۋەپ بولىدۇ' to a more natural, contemporary Uyghur expression that enhances readability and flow without losing theological precision or reverence. This stylistic adjustment will improve the translation's accessibility for modern readers while maintaining doctrinal integrity and respect appropriate to the sacred text. No content additions or theological changes are advised, only refinement of language style for a modern, fluid, and natural Bible translation.

The peer review corrections for Luke 1:16 highlight that the translation is faithful to the original Greek and conservative Christian theology but could be stylistically refined. Specifically, it is advised to rephrase "ئىسرائىل نەۋلىرىنىڭ كۆپچىلىگىنى" and "پەرۋەردىگار خۇداغا قايتىشىغا يېتەكلەيدۇ" into more natural, contemporary Uyghur expressions to enhance readability and flow. These refinements should maintain doctrinal accuracy and reverence, improving accessibility for modern readers without adding content or theological modifications.

The translation accurately reflects the original Greek text and maintains conservative Christian theological meaning regarding the virgin conception and naming of Jesus. However, improvements are recommended to enhance the naturalness and contemporary style of the Uyghur language used. Specifically, the phrase 'سەن ئۇنىڭ ئىسمىنى ئەيسا دەپ قويىسەن' should be revised to a more conversational and fluid expression. Additionally, consider using a more common contemporary spelling or pronunciation of Jesus's name, such as 'ئىيسا,' instead of the traditional 'ئەيسا,' to improve familiarity and readability for modern readers. Overall, maintain doctrinal accuracy while refining phrasing for a smoother, more accessible reading experience.

Working on verse LUK 1:31 which has grade 88.33333333333333

The translation of Luke 1:31 accurately conveys the conservative Christian meaning of the virgin conception and naming of Jesus, using clear and contemporary Uyghur language for most of the verse. However, the initial transitional word "بۇلاقتا" is consistently criticized across peer reviews as formal, awkward, or less natural in modern conversational Uyghur. It is recommended to replace "بۇلاقتا" with a more familiar and fluid temporal expression or omit it entirely to enhance readability and naturalness. The rest of the verse is well-translated, including the use of "ئىيسا" for Jesus's name, which aligns with previous improvements. No doctrinal changes or additions are necessary; focus on stylistic refinement at the beginning of the verse for a smoother, more accessible reading experience.

Working on verse LUK 1:66 which has grade 88.83333333333333

The peer reviewers agree that the translation of Luke 1:66 faithfully captures the original Greek text's meaning and maintains a conservative Christian theological perspective, especially emphasizing the Lord's hand being with the child. The translation is generally clear, accurate, and doctrinally sound. However, the phrase "ئۇلارنى كۆڭلىگە پۈكۈپ" (putting in their hearts) is repeatedly noted as awkward or less natural in contemporary Uyghur, which affects readability and smoothness. Reviewers suggest revising this phrase to a more colloquial or fluid expression that conveys the concept of pondering or considering internally in a clearer and more modern way. Apart from this, slight stylistic polishing is recommended to enhance overall naturalness and flow, making the text more accessible to modern readers. In summary, to improve the translation: (1) revise the phrase "ئۇلارنى كۆڭلىگە پۈكۈپ" for better naturalness and clarity; (2) polish sentence structure slightly for smoother and more contemporary Uyghur style; and (3) maintain the current theological fidelity and clarity in expressing the Lord's hand being with the child.

The peer review feedback on Luke 1:72-75 highlights that the translation faithfully conveys the conservative Christian theological content, accurately reflecting God's mercy, the holy covenant, the oath to Abraham, deliverance from enemies, and the call to serve God in holiness and righteousness. However, to enhance the translation's effectiveness for contemporary Uyghur readers, the following actionable corrections are recommended:

1. Simplify and modernize language: Replace formal, traditional, or somewhat heavy phrases such as "بىزگە بېرىلگەن ۋەدەگە سادىق قالدى," "ئەمەلدارلىق بىلەن قۇتقۇزۇپ," and "ھەم ئۆز ھاياتىمىزنىڭ ھەر كۈنىدە ئىخلاسمەن ۋە ھەققانىي بولۇۋالايلى" with more conversational and fluent alternatives that feel natural to today’s audience.

2. Improve sentence flow and readability: Break up lengthy or complex sentences to avoid heaviness and facilitate easier comprehension. Aim for smoother transitions between ideas.

3. Maintain theological accuracy and reverence: While making stylistic improvements, ensure that key theological terms and conservative Christian doctrinal perspectives remain intact without loss of meaning or depth.

4. Avoid archaic or overly formal expressions: Some phrases like "مەھرى-شەپقىتنى كۆرسەتتى" and "بىزنى دۈشمەنلىرىمىزنىڭ قولىدىن ئەمەلدارلىق بىلەن قۇتقۇزۇپ" are slightly formal or literal; consider softer, more natural phrasing.

5. Preserve clarity and naturalness: The translation should remain clear and accessible without awkwardness, promoting reader engagement and understanding.

In summary, the recommended corrections focus on balancing fidelity to the original Greek text and conservative theology with a more modern, natural, and fluent Uyghur style, thus enhancing readability and relevance for contemporary readers while maintaining doctrinal integrity.

The peer reviews commend the translation for accurately and faithfully conveying the original Greek text and conservative Christian interpretation of Luke 1:18, particularly Zechariah's doubt due to his and his wife's advanced age. However, multiple reviewers suggest improving the phrasing of certain expressions such as 'مەنمۇ قېرىپ قالغان' and 'خېلى ياشىنىپ قالغان تۇرسا' to achieve a more natural, contemporary, and conversational style that enhances flow and readability. These adjustments would better fulfill the translation goal of producing a clear, modern, and accessible Bible text without compromising theological accuracy or reverence.

Working on verse LUK 1:18 which has grade 88.83333333333333

The peer reviews agree that the current translation of Luke 1:18 faithfully conveys the original Greek meaning and maintains a conservative Christian interpretation, particularly highlighting Zechariah's and his wife's advanced age as the basis of doubt. However, multiple reviewers consistently note that the phrase 'مەن يېتىلگەن ياشقىچە كەلگەن' is somewhat awkward and not natural in contemporary Uyghur. They recommend revising this expression to a more idiomatic and fluent version that better communicates 'I am an old man' in a modern conversational style. Suggested alternatives include 'مەن بەك ياشسىز بولغانلىقىم بىلەن', 'مەن ياشىنىپ كەتكەن ئەدىم', or similar expressions. Additionally, the final question 'بۇ ئىشقا قانداق ئىشەنەلەيمەن؟' could be improved for naturalness by using expressions like 'مەن بۇنىڭ قانداق بولىدىغانلىقىنى قانداق بىلىمەن؟' or 'بۇ ئىشقا قانداق ئىشەنسەم بولىدۇ؟'. These refinements aim to improve readability and flow without compromising theological fidelity or reverence. No substantive content changes are needed, only stylistic enhancements to meet the objective of a clear, natural, and accessible Bible translation in contemporary Uyghur.

Working on verse LUK 1:72-75 which has grade 89.0

The peer review comments for Luke 1:72-75 acknowledge that the current Uyghur translation faithfully reflects conservative Christian theology, accurately portraying God's mercy, the holy covenant, the oath to Abraham, deliverance from enemies, and the call to serve God in holiness and righteousness. However, to enhance readability and engagement for contemporary Uyghur readers, the translation should be revised to employ simpler, more conversational, and natural language. Specifically, rephrase formal, traditional, or heavy expressions such as "ئابەدىي ئۇدۇل سۆزىگە تايانغان," "بىزنى دۈشمەنلەرنىڭ قولىدىن خەۋپسىز قۇتقۇزۇپ," and "خۇدا پەرۋەردىگارغا ھەمىشە سادىق بولۇپ" with more fluid and idiomatic alternatives. Breaking longer sentences into shorter ones will improve flow and comprehension. Throughout these revisions, it is critical to maintain theological accuracy, reverence, and doctrinal integrity consistent with conservative Christian interpretation. Avoid archaic or overly literal phrasing to achieve a more accessible, engaging, and modern Uyghur Bible translation without compromising the sacred message. Additionally, ensure that no previously removed content is reintroduced, respecting prior editorial decisions.

The translation of Luke 1:4 is theologically accurate and preserves conservative Christian doctrine, emphasizing assurance in the teachings received. Peer reviewers commend its clarity and faithfulness to the original Greek text but consistently recommend improving naturalness and modern readability in Uyghur. To enhance accessibility for contemporary readers, it is advised to soften and modernize the phrasing by simplifying sentence structure and adopting a more conversational style without compromising doctrinal clarity or reverence. Specifically, formal or heavy expressions like "سىلى ئىچىڭلاردا قەتئىي ئىشەنچ ھاسىل قىلغىنىڭلار" should be replaced with more fluid and natural wording. Overall, the translation meets doctrinal goals but can be refined for smoother, more natural expression to better engage modern Uyghur-speaking audiences.

The current Uyghur translation of Luke 1:12 accurately conveys the original Greek meaning and conservative Christian interpretation, effectively portraying Zacharias's fear and astonishment upon seeing the angel. Peer reviewers unanimously recommend refining the translation's style by replacing somewhat formal and slightly archaic phrases like 'ناھايىتى ھەيران بولۇپ' and 'زور قورقۇنچقا چۈشتى' with more modern, conversational, and natural expressions that resonate better with contemporary Uyghur readers. These stylistic adjustments should maintain the vividness, theological integrity, and core meaning of the passage while enhancing readability and engagement. No additional content or doctrinal changes are advised; focus solely on smoothening and modernizing the language to align with the translation's objective of a natural, faithful, and accessible text.

The peer review affirms that the current translation of Luke 1:1 accurately conveys the original Greek meaning and maintains the conservative Christian perspective. However, multiple reviewers note that the phrase "رەئايە قىلغان" (meaning 'shepherded' or 'cared for') is somewhat archaic, unnatural, or inappropriate in this context. It is recommended to replace this phrase with more suitable alternatives such as "يىغىپ" (compiled), "تەپسىلاتىنى بىلگەن" (known the details), or "تەرتىپكە سالماققا تىرىشتى" (tried to put in order) to better reflect the idea of gathering and arranging eyewitness accounts. Reviewers also suggest simplifying sentence structures and using more conversational, contemporary Uyghur language to improve readability and flow without compromising theological accuracy. Overall, the translation should maintain a natural and fluid style accessible to modern readers while faithfully preserving the doctrinal and historical reliability emphasized in conservative Christian theology.

The peer review highlights that the student's translation of Luke 1:3 is accurate and reverent, aligning well with the original Greek text and conservative Christian perspective. However, multiple reviewers recommend adopting a more contemporary, natural, and conversational style to improve readability and accessibility for modern Uigara speakers. To enhance the translation, simplify and modernize some formal expressions while preserving theological accuracy and respectful tone toward Theophilus. Maintaining clarity, doctrinal faithfulness, and a smooth, modern flow is essential for balancing scriptural solemnity with approachability. Overall, the translation is solid but would benefit from stylistic adjustments toward a more natural modern register.

Working on verse LUK 1:3 which has grade 89.0

The translation of Luke 1:3 is consistently praised for its faithful preservation of the original Greek meaning and conservative Christian interpretation, maintaining reverence and doctrinal accuracy. It effectively conveys Luke's intent to provide a carefully investigated, orderly account addressed respectfully to Theophilus. Reviewers commend the clear, formal, and understandable language that aligns well with contemporary Uyghur usage. However, some phrases such as "ھەمىشە قايتا-قايتا كۆرۈپ چىقىپ" (always repeatedly reviewing) and "بەت-بەت تەرتىپ بويىچە" (page by page in order) are noted as slightly heavy, stiff, or old-fashioned, which may reduce naturalness and flow. The main actionable corrections are to simplify and modernize such expressions to achieve a more fluid, natural, and conversational style without compromising theological fidelity or respectfulness. This balance will improve readability and accessibility for modern readers. Overall, the translation is strong and accurate, requiring only minor stylistic refinements to better meet the goal of a contemporary, natural Uyghur Bible translation.

Working on verse LUK 1:3 which has grade 88.66666666666667

The translation of Luke 1:3 is accurate and theologically faithful, respectfully addressing Theophilus in line with conservative Christian perspectives. However, the phrase 'دەرتسىزلەرگە تەرتىپلىك تۈزۈپ' is problematic because 'دەرتسىزلەرگە' is unnatural and may confuse modern Uyghur readers, as it does not correctly represent the Greek 'to you' and can imply unintended meanings like 'to the distressed' or 'to the careless.' The primary correction is to replace 'دەرتسىزلەرگە' with a more natural, clear expression that directly and respectfully addresses Theophilus. Reviewers also suggest simplifying and modernizing some formal or heavy phrases to enhance readability and fluidity while maintaining doctrinal accuracy and reverence. These refinements will improve naturalness and accessibility, balancing scriptural solemnity with a contemporary style. Overall, the translation is strong but would benefit from these targeted stylistic and phrasing adjustments to better serve modern Uyghur readers.

Working on verse LUK 1:3 which has grade 89.33333333333333

The translation of Luke 1:3 is accurate, reverent, and faithful to the original Greek and conservative Christian interpretation. The respectful address to Theophilus as 'ئەزىز تېئوفىلۇس' is appropriate but could be slightly modernized for a more natural contemporary tone. The wording is clear and formal but tends to be somewhat classical and stiff, reducing naturalness and fluidity. To enhance readability and accessibility for modern Uyghur readers, simplify and modernize formal phrases such as 'مۇۋاپىق دەپ قارىدىم' and streamline sentence structure for a smoother, more conversational style. These adjustments should maintain theological fidelity and respectfulness while improving the flow and natural expression. Avoid unnatural or confusing phrases and preserve the careful, orderly intent of the author. Overall, focus on stylistic refinement to balance scriptural solemnity with modern naturalness, making the translation more approachable without compromising doctrinal integrity.

Working on verse LUK 1:26-27 which has grade 89.5

The peer review of the Uyghur translation of Luke 1:26-27 confirms that it accurately and faithfully conveys conservative Christian theology, including the angel Gabriel's mission, Mary's virginity, and Joseph's Davidic lineage. However, multiple reviewers recommend improving the translation's style to enhance naturalness, fluidity, and accessibility for modern Uyghur readers. Key corrections include replacing archaic or overly formal phrases (e.g., expressions for "virgin betrothed to Joseph" and "David's lineage") with clearer, more contemporary and conversational wording. Unnecessary or subjective descriptive language not present in the original Greek should be removed to maintain simplicity and doctrinal accuracy. Sentence structures should be streamlined to improve flow and engagement. Overall, the translation should maintain theological fidelity while adopting a modern, natural, and reader-friendly Uyghur style.

The peer review feedback affirms the translation's conservative Christian theological accuracy in Luke 1:26-27, including Gabriel's divine sending, Joseph's Davidic lineage, and Mary's virginity and betrothal. However, reviewers recommend stylistic improvements to increase naturalness and readability in modern Uyghur. Specifically, archaic, formal, and cumbersome phrases such as 'يەنە تويلانغان، بىۋاسىتە پەرۋەردىگار ئالدىدا پاكلىقنى ساقلاپ قالغان بىر قىز' should be simplified to clearer, more contemporary expressions. Sentence constructions should be streamlined to enhance flow and engagement. Unnecessary subjective or descriptive language not found in the original Greek should be avoided. These changes aim to maintain doctrinal fidelity while producing a fluent, accessible, and reader-friendly translation suitable for modern Uyghur audiences.

Working on verse LUK 1:26-27 which has grade 87.5

The translation of Luke 1:26-27 is doctrinally accurate and faithful to the conservative Christian interpretation, correctly identifying the angel Gabriel, Mary's virginity, Joseph's Davidic lineage, and Mary's betrothal. However, the peer review highlights that the current Uyghur translation's style is somewhat formal, archaic, and less natural for contemporary readers. To improve, the translation should replace formal or awkward phrases (e.g., "ئالتۇنچى ئايدا", "يۈسۈپنىڭ كېلىنى بولغان", "داۋۇتنىڭ ئاندان چىققان پاك قىز") with clearer, more conversational, and modern Uyghur expressions. Subjective or unnecessary descriptive language not found in the Greek original should be avoided to maintain simplicity and doctrinal integrity. Sentence structures should be smoothed and shortened where possible to enhance fluidity and engagement. These adjustments will maintain theological fidelity while producing a more accessible, natural, and reader-friendly translation suitable for modern Uyghur audiences, fulfilling the objective of a clear and respectful conservative Christian Bible translation.

The translation of Luke 1:33 is theologically accurate and faithful to conservative Christian doctrine, effectively communicating the eternal reign of Jesus over the house of Jacob and the unending nature of His kingdom. However, to enhance readability and relatability for contemporary Uyghur speakers, the translation should adopt a more natural and conversational style, soften formal phrasing, and consider replacing less common expressions with more familiar alternatives. Minor stylistic revisions that preserve doctrinal accuracy will improve the translation's naturalness and accessibility for modern readers.

The translation of Luke 1:36 is accurate and faithful to the original Greek text and aligns well with conservative Christian doctrine, clearly communicating Elizabeth's miraculous pregnancy despite her advanced age and previous barrenness. The main actionable correction is to revise the wording to achieve a more natural, contemporary, and conversational Uyghur style, enhancing readability and flow without compromising theological accuracy. Specifically, consider softening or rephrasing formal or traditional expressions like 'ياشنىپ قالغان بولسىمۇ' and 'تۇغماس دېيىلگۈچى' to better fit modern Uyghur usage. Implementing these stylistic improvements will produce a clearer and more engaging translation while preserving doctrinal integrity.

Working on verse LUK 1:36 which has grade 88.5

The peer review highlights that the current translation of Luke 1:36 accurately and faithfully conveys Elizabeth's miraculous pregnancy despite her advanced age, aligning well with conservative Christian doctrine. However, the phrase describing Elizabeth as "the one called barren" is overly complex, somewhat archaic, and potentially confusing for modern Uyghur readers. Reviewers recommend simplifying and clarifying this phrase to express Elizabeth's previous barrenness and current pregnancy in a straightforward, natural, and contemporary style. Additionally, softening formal or traditional expressions can enhance readability and engagement without compromising theological integrity. No content additions are necessary. The main actionable correction is to revise the cumbersome phrase to improve clarity and naturalness, ensuring the translation remains faithful, accessible, and stylistically modern.

Working on verse LUK 1:36 which has grade 85.0

The translation of Luke 1:36 accurately reflects the conservative Christian understanding of Elizabeth's miraculous pregnancy in old age. Peer reviewers recommend stylistic refinements to improve naturalness and readability in modern Uyghur. Specifically, simplify or rephrase formal, archaic, or complex expressions such as 'بۇرۇن بۆسۈكلۈكتىن ئازاپ چېككەن' (previously suffered from barrenness) and 'بۇرۇنقىغا ئوخشىمىغان ھەيران قالارلىق' (astonishingly different from before) to achieve a more concise, fluid, and conversational style. These adjustments will enhance clarity and engagement without compromising doctrinal integrity or the essential message. No content additions or theological changes are required, only stylistic improvements for a natural, contemporary tone that remains faithful to the original Greek text and conservative Christian doctrine.

The peer review confirms that the translation of Luke 1:36 is accurate and faithful to the original Greek text and aligns with conservative Christian doctrine by clearly conveying Elizabeth's miraculous pregnancy despite her advanced age and prior barrenness. The main actionable correction is to revise the phrasing "بۆسۈك كىلىپ قالغان پەيتىدە" ("became barren") to a more natural, contemporary, and conversational Uyghur expression that better communicates Elizabeth's previous barrenness without sounding archaic or formal. Additionally, softening or rephrasing other formal or traditional expressions can enhance readability and engagement, ensuring the translation flows smoothly and feels accessible to modern readers. These stylistic improvements should maintain doctrinal integrity and the original message without adding or removing content. Implementing these revisions will produce a clearer, more fluent, and engaging translation that meets the objective of a natural and contemporary style.

The peer reviews confirm that the translation of Luke 1:36 faithfully conveys the conservative Christian understanding of Elizabeth's miraculous pregnancy despite her advanced age and previous barrenness. The primary actionable correction is to revise formal, archaic, or slightly awkward phrases to enhance naturalness and fluency in contemporary Uyghur without altering the theological content. For example, expressions like "باشقا ئالدىن ئالاھىدە بالا تۇغالمىغان" and "ياشلىقى ئۆتكەن بولسىمۇ" should be softened or rephrased to sound more conversational and accessible to modern readers. No additions or removals of content are needed, only stylistic improvements to ensure the translation flows smoothly and engages readers while maintaining doctrinal accuracy and faithfulness to the original Greek text.

The peer review comments confirm that the translation of Luke 1:36 is accurate and faithful to the original Greek text and aligns well with conservative Christian doctrine, particularly emphasizing Elizabeth's miraculous pregnancy despite her advanced age and previous barrenness. The main actionable corrections focus on improving stylistic elements to achieve a more natural, contemporary, and conversational Uyghur expression. Specifically, expressions describing Elizabeth's old age (e.g., 'ياشى ئۈستى بولسىمۇ') and barrenness (e.g., 'مۇقىم بالىسى يوق بىر ئايال', 'بۆسۈك كىلىپ قالغان پەيتىدە', 'تۇغماس دېيىلگۈچى') are somewhat formal, archaic, or awkward and should be softened or rephrased for better fluency and readability. No content additions or theological changes are recommended to preserve doctrinal integrity. Implementing these stylistic improvements will enhance clarity, engagement, and accessibility for modern readers while maintaining the essential conservative Christian message.

The peer reviews affirm that the current translation of Luke 1:36 accurately conveys Elizabeth's miraculous pregnancy despite her advanced age and previous barrenness, aligning with conservative Christian doctrine. The main actionable corrections are to revise the phrase "بۆسۈشنى بۈتۈنلەي تاماملىغان" which is overly literal, clinical, and inaccurate in relation to the original Greek term for "barren." It should be replaced with a more natural, contemporary, and precise Uyghur expression that clearly denotes sterility and prior barrenness. Additionally, other formal or archaic expressions describing Elizabeth's age and barrenness should be softened or rephrased for improved naturalness, readability, and conversational flow in modern Uyghur. These stylistic adjustments will enhance clarity and engagement without changing theological content or adding new information. The translation should maintain faithfulness to the original text and uphold conservative Christian doctrinal integrity while achieving a natural and accessible style for today's readers.

To improve, adjust the phrasing, especially "He looked upon the humble state of His servant" ("ئۇ دېدىكىنىڭ مىسكىن ھالىغا نەزەر سالدى"), to sound more contemporary and natural in modern Uyghur without sacrificing theological meaning. Enhancing the fluidity and conversational tone will increase readability and engagement for today's readers. The rest of the translation effectively communicates the intended message and maintains theological correctness.

The peer reviews affirm that the translation of Luke 1:54-55 faithfully preserves the conservative Christian theological meaning, accurately reflecting God's mercy towards Israel and His covenant promises to Abraham and his descendants. The wording is clear, understandable, and doctrinally sound. However, multiple reviewers note that some phrases, particularly "ئۇ ئۆز رەھىم-شەپقىتىنى ئېسىدە تۇتۇپ," come across as somewhat formal and less natural for modern Uyghur readers. To enhance readability and engagement, it is recommended to revise such expressions to be more fluid, contemporary, and natural in everyday Uyghur speech, while preserving the theological accuracy and fidelity to the original Greek text. Overall, the translation is strong but could benefit from stylistic adjustments to achieve a more modern, accessible tone.

The translation of Luke 1:54-55 accurately conveys the conservative Christian theological message, emphasizing God's mercy toward Israel and His covenant promises to Abraham and his descendants. However, reviewers consistently note that the language is somewhat formal, dense, and less natural for modern Uyghur readers. To improve, it is recommended to simplify and modernize phrasing to a more conversational and fluid style. Specifically, expressions like 'رەھمىتىنى ئىسرائىل ئۆيىگە نەزەرگە ئالدى' and 'مىڭ ئەسر بولىدىغان ۋەدە بويىچە' should be reworded for smoother readability and natural flow. These stylistic adjustments should maintain doctrinal accuracy and fidelity to the original text, enhancing accessibility and engagement for contemporary audiences without altering theological content.

The peer reviews affirm that the translation of Luke 1:54-55 accurately reflects conservative Christian theology, emphasizing God's mercy to Israel and His eternal covenant with Abraham and his descendants. However, the translation style is consistently noted as somewhat formal and less natural for modern Uyghur readers. To improve, it is recommended to revise phrasing to be more contemporary, conversational, and fluid while maintaining theological accuracy and fidelity to the original Greek text. Specific phrases such as "خۇدا ئىسرائىلغا قارىتىپ ئۆز رەھمىتىنى ئەسلەپ" and "مەڭگۈلۈك ۋەدەگە رىئايە قىلىدۇ" could be reworded for smoother readability and a more natural flow. These stylistic enhancements should not alter doctrinal content or introduce omitted material. Overall, the translation is strong and faithful but would benefit from careful stylistic modernization to increase accessibility and engagement for today's Uyghur readers.

The translation of Luke 1:54-55 accurately and faithfully conveys the conservative Christian theological message, highlighting God's mercy to Israel and His everlasting covenant with Abraham and his descendants. However, the phrasing is somewhat formal and less natural for modern Uyghur readers, particularly the phrase 'مۆھتاجلىق بىلەن مەدەت قىلدى' ('helped with need'). To improve readability and engagement, it is recommended to revise such expressions to a more contemporary, fluid, and natural style—examples include 'رەھىم قىلىپ ياد قىلدى' ('mercifully remembered'). These stylistic adjustments should preserve doctrinal accuracy and fidelity to the original text without altering theological content. The overall goal is to achieve a modern, clear, and accessible translation that resonates well with today's Uyghur audience while maintaining conservative Christian beliefs.

However, the style is consistently noted as somewhat formal, dense, and less natural for modern Uyghur readers.

The translation should maintain its respectful and reverent tone appropriate for Scripture, avoid introducing omitted content or theological changes, and focus solely on stylistic adjustments to better engage modern Uyghur audiences.

The peer reviews unanimously confirm that the translation of Luke 1:54-55 accurately preserves conservative Christian theology, emphasizing God's mercy to Israel and the eternal covenant with Abraham and his descendants. However, multiple reviewers note that the current phrasing is somewhat formal, dense, and occasionally archaic for modern Uyghur readers. Specific terms such as "مەمۇر قىلدى" and "ئەسلەپ" contribute to a stiff and distant tone, reducing natural readability and engagement. To address this, it is recommended to revise these expressions into more conversational, fluid, and natural Uyghur language, enhancing accessibility and ease of understanding without compromising doctrinal accuracy or theological meaning. Simplifying sentence structure and softening formal vocabulary will make the text more relatable to contemporary readers while maintaining reverence appropriate for Scripture. No additions or omissions of content should occur; the focus is solely on stylistic modernization. This approach will result in a clear, accessible, and faithful translation that aligns well with the stated translation objectives and appeals to modern Uyghur audiences.

The peer reviews unanimously confirm that the translation of Luke 1:54-55 is theologically accurate and faithful to conservative Christian beliefs, effectively conveying God's mercy to Israel and His eternal covenant with Abraham and his descendants. The main recommendation is to revise the translation style from formal, dense, and somewhat archaic language to a more contemporary, natural, and fluid Uyghur style that improves readability and engagement for modern audiences. Specific expressions identified as formal or heavy—such as 'ئەبەدىي تەقدىم قىلىنغان ۋەدەگە' (eternally given promise), 'رەھىم قىلدى' (showed mercy), and 'ئەسلەپ' (remembered)—should be softened or reworded into more conversational, accessible phrasing without losing theological accuracy or altering content. Sentence structure could also be slightly simplified to enhance smoothness and flow. Importantly, these stylistic changes must maintain doctrinal fidelity, reverence, and completeness, avoiding any additions or omissions of meaning. Implementing these stylistic improvements will result in a clear, accessible, and reverent translation that better resonates with contemporary Uyghur readers while upholding the conservative Christian perspective.

The peer reviews unanimously confirm that the current translation of Luke 1:54-55 faithfully conveys conservative Christian theology, emphasizing God's mercy towards Israel and His eternal covenant with Abraham and his descendants. However, the language is consistently described as formal, dense, and somewhat literal or archaic, which hinders natural readability and engagement for contemporary Uyghur readers. Reviewers recommend stylistic modernization: simplifying and softening formal phrases like "ئىسرائىلنىڭ تۇغقانلىرىغا" (Israel's relatives), "يادىغا سالدى" (remembered), and "مەڭگۈلۈك سۆز بىلەن مۇقىملاشتۇردى" (established with eternal word) into more conversational, fluid, and natural Uyghur expressions. These changes should preserve doctrinal accuracy, theological fidelity, and scriptural reverence without introducing additions, omissions, or alterations to meaning. The goal is a clear, accessible, and engaging translation aligned with conservative Christian beliefs and suitable for modern Uyghur readers.

Working on verse LUK 1:1 which has grade 89.66666666666667

The peer review affirms that the current translation of Luke 1:1 is faithful to the original Greek text and conservatively doctrinal, successfully conveying that many have attempted to compile an orderly account of the fulfilled events among us. However, several reviewers recommend stylistic improvements to enhance naturalness and readability for modern Uyghur readers. Key suggestions include replacing the somewhat awkward phrase 'بەك كۆپ مەلۇماتقا ئىگە بولغان' with expressions that better emphasize the fulfilled or fully known nature of the events, such as 'completely reliable and firm information.' Additionally, simplifying sentence structure and choosing more conversational, fluid verbs will improve accessibility without compromising theological integrity. Avoiding overly formal or archaic terms ensures a natural flow. Implementing these refinements will balance literal accuracy, conservative Christian doctrine, and a contemporary, approachable style suitable for the intended audience.

Working on verse LUK 1:11 which has grade 89.66666666666667

The translation of Luke 1:11 is accurate and faithful to the original Greek, preserving the conservative Christian understanding. However, the addition of 'تۇيۇقسىز' ('suddenly') introduces a nuance absent from the source text and should be reconsidered to maintain textual fidelity. The phrase 'خۇشبۇيگاھنىڭ ئوڭ تەرىپىدە' ('on the right side of the incense altar') is somewhat formal and could be revised to a more natural, contemporary expression such as 'خۇشبۇي سېلىش ئورنى' ('place of incense') or a similar phrase to improve readability and flow. These adjustments will enhance the translation's naturalness and accessibility for a modern Uigara audience while retaining theological correctness and reverence.

Working on verse LUK 1:11 which has grade 89.5

The current translation of Luke 1:11 is theologically accurate, faithful to the Greek source, and effectively conveys the conservative Christian meaning. Reviewers recommend maintaining this accuracy and theological reverence while slightly softening the formal tone to make the language more natural, contemporary, and conversational in modern Uyghur. The phrase 'خۇشبۇي سېلىش ئورنى' is acceptable but could be smoothed for better flow. Importantly, avoid adding words like 'تۇيۇقسىز' ('suddenly') that are not in the original text. Overall, focus on enhancing readability and naturalness without altering theological content or introducing unnecessary additions.

Working on verse LUK 1:11 which has grade 85.0

The translation of Luke 1:11 is theologically accurate and faithfully represents the conservative Christian understanding. However, the current phrasing is somewhat formal and passive, especially the use of "كۈرۈلدى" (was seen), which reduces naturalness and contemporary readability. It is recommended to replace this with a more active and conversational expression to improve flow and engagement. The phrase "خۇشبۇي سېلىنىدىغان ئورۇن" is acceptable but could be refined to a more natural, idiomatic form without altering the meaning, for example, "خۇشبۇي سېلىنغان مەبەد ئورنى" or a similar smoother phrase. Avoid adding any words not found in the original Greek text, such as "تۇيۇقسىز" (suddenly), to maintain textual fidelity. These adjustments will enhance readability and accessibility for a modern Uyghur audience while preserving conservative Christian doctrinal accuracy.

The peer review confirms that the Luke 1:11 translation accurately and faithfully conveys the conservative Christian interpretation. To improve, revise formal and cumbersome phrasing such as "زەكەرىيانىڭ خۇشبۇي سېلىنغان مەبەد ئورنىنىڭ ئوڭ ياندا تۇرۇپ" to more natural, fluent expressions suitable for contemporary Uyghur readers while preserving the original meaning. Replace formal or passive verbs like "كۈرۈندى" with more active, conversational equivalents to enhance readability and engagement. Avoid introducing any words or nuances not found in the original Greek text (e.g., "تۇيۇقسىز"). Consider refining literal terms like "مәбەد ئورنى" to idiomatic phrases that improve flow without compromising theological accuracy. Overall, aim for a balance between faithfulness and stylistic naturalness, ensuring the translation remains doctrinally sound and accessible to modern audiences without repeating past editorial errors.

The translation of Luke 1:47 as "روھىم قۇتقۇزغۇچىم خۇدادىن شادلاندى" is accurate and faithfully reflects the original Greek text and conservative Christian theology, clearly expressing the spirit's joy in God as Savior. Reviewers agree the language is generally clear, natural, and suitable for modern Uyghur readers. To improve, the translation could adopt a more conversational and fluid style to sound less formal and more relatable. Additionally, slightly refining the phrase "شادلاندى" to better convey the exultant joy implied in the Greek "ἠγαλλίασε" would enhance the vividness and emotional impact. Implementing these stylistic adjustments will balance doctrinal faithfulness with contemporary readability and naturalness for the target audience.

The translation of Luke 1:47 as 'روھىم قۇتقۇزغۇچىم خۇدادىن چوڭ خۇشاللىققا تولدى' accurately reflects the original text and conservative Christian doctrine. However, reviewers suggest improving the stylistic aspects to make the language more natural, conversational, and contemporary for modern Uyghur readers.

The peer reviews affirm that the current translation "روھىم قۇتقۇزغۇچىم خۇدادا ناھايىتى خۇشال بولدى" accurately conveys the original Greek and aligns with conservative Christian theology, emphasizing Mary's spirit rejoicing in God as Savior. However, all reviewers agree that the phrase "ناھايىتى خۇشال بولدى" ("was very happy") is somewhat formal, literal, or colloquial and does not fully capture the depth and reverence of the original term "ἠγαλλίασε" (exulted, rejoiced greatly). The main correction is to stylistically refine this phrase to be more natural, contemporary, and fluid in Uyghur, while preserving theological faithfulness and clarity. This involves adopting a more idiomatic and emotionally vivid expression that better reflects the profound spiritual joy expressed, without adding new content or theological concepts. The goal is to improve readability, relatability, and emotional impact, balancing conservative theology with modern, natural language suitable for contemporary Uyghur Bible readers.

The translation of LUK 1:15 is doctrinally accurate and faithful to the original Greek text, effectively conveying John's greatness before the Lord, his abstention from wine and strong drink, and being filled with the Holy Spirit from his mother's womb. To further improve the translation, it is recommended to: 1) Replace the phrase "ئارىقسىز ئىچىملىكلەر" with a clearer term that explicitly denotes "wine and strong drink" to prevent confusion about alcohol content; 2) Simplify and modernize expressions related to the time John was filled with the Holy Spirit, such as replacing "ئانچە كىچىك دەۋرىدىن باشلاپ" with more natural, fluent phrases like "from his mother's womb"; 3) Avoid formal, wordy, or heavy phrasing to enhance readability and naturalness for contemporary Uyghur readers; 4) Maintain a conversational style without sacrificing theological clarity. Implementing these refinements will preserve the conservative Christian viewpoint while making the verse more accessible and clear for modern audiences.

The peer review affirms the current Uyghur translation of Luke 1:48 accurately reflects the original Greek and maintains a conservative Christian theological perspective, highlighting Mary's humility and God's favor alongside the blessing upon all generations. The main actionable corrections involve minor stylistic improvements to enhance naturalness, fluidity, and readability for contemporary Uyghur readers. Specifically, soften formal or heavy phrases like "توۋەن ۋە سادىق خىزمەتچى" (humble and faithful servant) by using more conversational and natural expressions. Replace less common or slightly archaic terms such as "ئېناۋەتلەتتى" with more accessible equivalents to improve engagement without losing theological depth. Additionally, consider simplifying or breaking up longer sentences to improve flow and clarity. No changes to doctrinal meaning or theological content should be made, especially avoiding reintroduction of previously removed content. Overall, implement slight modernization in phrasing and sentence structure to achieve a faithful yet more readable and accessible translation for modern Uyghur audiences.

The peer review confirms that the current Uyghur translation of Luke 1:48 is theologically accurate and faithful to the original Greek within a conservative Christian framework. The main actionable corrections focus on stylistic refinements: soften or replace formal and somewhat heavy phrases such as "خۇدا مېنىڭ كۆڭۈلدىكى پاك، بەك توۋەن يۈرەك ئىبادەتچى" with more natural, conversational expressions better reflecting humility rather than purity; improve the flow by simplifying or breaking up long sentences; and substitute stiff terms like "بەك بەھرىيەتلىك قىلدى" with more fluid, contemporary language. These changes aim to enhance readability, naturalness, and engagement for modern Uyghur readers without altering doctrinal meaning or reintroducing previously removed content. Overall, slight modernization of phrasing and sentence structure is recommended to achieve a clear, accessible, and faithful translation consistent with conservative Christian theology.

The translation of Luke 1:60 accurately conveys the original Greek text and conservatively Christian meaning, correctly naming the child as John (يەھيا). To enhance readability and approachability for modern Uyghur readers, it is recommended to improve the style by making the phrasing more natural, fluid, and contemporary.

The translation of Luke 1:61 accurately reflects the original Greek text and upholds conservative Christian theology. However, stylistic improvements are recommended to enhance naturalness and readability in modern Uyghur. Specifically, replace the awkward and indirect phrase "ئۇلار مېنىڭغا" ('they said to me') with a more appropriate alternative such as "ئۇلار ئۇنىڭغا" ('they said to her') or "ئۇلار دېدى" ('they said') to better match the original narrative perspective. Additionally, simplify the phrase "يەنى بۇنداق ئىسىمدا كىشى يوق دەپ تەسىر قىلدى" ('as if indicating that no one had such a name') to a more straightforward and fluent expression. These changes will preserve doctrinal integrity and accuracy while making the text more accessible and natural for contemporary readers.

Specifically, they suggest revising formal phrases such as "سىزنىڭ ئائىلەڭىزدە بۇ ئىسىمدىكى بىرەر كىشى بارمۇ؟" to more colloquial expressions like "سىزنىڭ ئائىلەڭىزدە بۇ ئىسىمدا بىرەر كىشى يوق" to enhance readability.

The translation of Luke 1:78-79 is accurate and maintains conservative Christian theology effectively, emphasizing God's mercy, the coming of light, and guidance to peace. Peer reviewers suggest improving the translation's style by making it more natural and contemporary in Uyghur. Specifically, simplify complex or formal expressions such as "ئۇ بىزگە ئۈستىمىزگە يورۇقلۇق كەلتۈردى" and "قارىغۇچىلىق ۋە ئۆلۈم سېلىقىدا قاپلانغانلارنى كۆزنى ئاچقۇزۇپ" to enhance readability and flow.

Simplify sentence structures where possible to improve smoothness without losing theological meaning. Overall, retain the doctrinal accuracy and key theological concepts while adopting a more fluid, accessible, and modern Uyghur style.
